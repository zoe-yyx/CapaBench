  Theorem iter_S: forall {A: Type} (n: nat) (f: A -> A) (x: A),   Nat.iter n f (f x) = Nat.iter (S n) f x. 
 Based on the current reasoning and historical actions, it seems that there is a syntax error in the proof script. Here is the corrected proof script:
```coq
- refine (match n with
          | 0 => simpl. reflexivity.
          | S _ => _
          end).
