  Theorem iter_S: forall {A: Type} (n: nat) (f: A -> A) (x: A),   Nat.iter n f (f x) = Nat.iter (S n) f x. 
 Based on the current reasoning and historical actions, the proof attempt for the `iter_S` theorem seems to be incomplete and contains syntax errors. Here's a corrected proof attempt:
Lemma iter\_S\_helper {A: Type} (m: nat) (f: A -> A) (x: A): Nat.iter m f (f x) = Nat.iter (S m) f x.
Proof.
  induction m as [|m IHm].
  - reflexivity.
  - rewrite IHm; reflexivity.
Qed.
Theorem iter\_S: forall {A: Type} (n: nat) (f: A -> A) (x: A), Nat.iter n f (f x) = Nat.iter (S n) f x.
Proof.
  induction n as [|n IHn].
  - reflexivity.
  - rewrite <- (iter\_S\_helper n f x); simpl; rewrite IHn; reflexivity.
Qed.
Please replace the current proof attempt with the above corrected version and try again.
