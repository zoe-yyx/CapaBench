                "reasoning": "\nGiven that the lia tactic unexpectedly failed to solve our goal x * x >= 0, we need to adjust our approach. The fact that this simple arithmetic inequality wasn't automatically solved suggests we might need to break down the proof into more basic steps or use alternative tactics. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. First, we should try other automated tactics that are good at handling arithmetic inequalities. The omega tactic, while older than lia, might be able to handle this case. If omega is not available or doesn't work, we can try ring or ring_simplify, which are particularly good at dealing with polynomial expressions.\n\n2. If these automated tactics also fail, we should resort to a more manual approach. We can break down the proof by considering the possible cases for x:\n   - x > 0\n   - x = 0\n   - x < 0\n\n3. For each case, we can prove that x * x >= 0 holds:\n   - When x > 0, x * x > 0 is obvious\n   - When x = 0, 0 * 0 = 0 >= 0\n   - When x < 0, we can use the fact that a negative number multiplied by itself is positive\n\n4. If we need to prove these basic facts, we might use tactics like assert, rewrite, or apply in combination with existing lemmas about integer arithmetic.\n\n5. As a last resort, if no existing lemmas seem to help, we might need to prove a helper lemma stating that the square of any integer is non-negative, and then use this lemma in our main proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I suggest we start by trying the omega tactic. If that doesn't work, we should move on to ring or ring_simplify. If automated tactics continue to fail, we should proceed with the manual case analysis approach.\n",

The omega tactic is not available in this version of Coq, which caused an error. We should use nia (non-linear integer arithmetic) instead, which is a more powerful tactic that can handle such inequalities.\n\n2. The case analysis was incomplete and contained errors. In the equality case (Heq : 0 = a), the reflexivity tactic was inappropriate for proving an inequality.\n\n3. The assertion of the helper lemma (H: forall a : Z, a * a >= 0) was correct, but its proof was incomplete, and it wasn't properly applied to solve the main goal.\n\n4. The ring_simplify tactic changed x * x to x ^ 2, which is fine, but we need to ensure our proof works with this new form.\n\nFor the next steps, I suggest:\n\n1. Start the proof fresh, using unfold and nia to attempt a direct solution.\n2. If nia doesn't solve it directly, proceed with the case analysis, but ensure each case is properly handled:\n   - For the equality case, use rewrite and reflexivity.\n   - For the inequality cases, use Z.mul_nonneg_nonneg and nia.\n3.

According to the given plan, our crucial next step involves utilizing the hypothesis that function 'f' under consideration is monotonic (i.e., 'mono f'). With that, we need to show that applying 'shift_left1' to 'f' results in a function that still satisfies the property of being monotonic, i.e., 'mono (shift_left1 f)'.\n\nThis next part focuses on proving 'mono (shift_left1 f)', where we will aim to demonstrate that for any integers n and m with n \u2264 m, '(shift_left1 f) n' \u2264 '(shift_left1 f) m' holds true. Breaking this down by the definition of 'shift_left1', this is equivalent to showing 'f (n + 1) \u2264 f (m + 1)'. Since 'f' is monotonic and we know n \u2264 m, we directly deduce n + 1 \u2264 m + 1. Applying the monotonicity of 'f', this gives us 'f (n + 1) \u2264 f (m + 1)'. This chain of implications leans on the transitivity of arithmetic and the given properties of 'f', moving us towards wrapping up this part of the proof effectively.\n\nRemember to handle any substitution required for transforming specific instances back to the general form needed to formally conclude the proof within Coq.

Begin by opening the necessary scopes and importing required libraries, which have already been done with `Require Import` statements and `Local Open Scope Z`.\n\n2. Understand the definitions:\n   - `shift_up1` is a function that takes another function `f` and an integer `x`, and returns the result of `f x` incremented by 1.\n   - `func_plus` is a function that takes two functions `f` and `g` and returns a new function that, when called with an argument `x`, returns the sum of `f x` and `g x`.\n\n3. The theorem to be proved is an equation between two functions. We will need to show that for every `x : Z`, the result of `shift_up1 f x` is the same as the result of `(func_plus f (fun x => 1)) x`.\n\n4. We can approach this proof using the `eq_rect` tactic, which is used for proving equality of functions by structural recursion on the type of the input.\n\n5. The plan is as follows:\n   - Start the proof with `Proof.`, followed by `intros f x.` to introduce the universal quantification over `f` and the variable `x`.\n   - Apply the `eq_rect` tactic on the type of `Z` to begin the proof by induction on the structure of `x`.\n   - Use the `reflexivity` tactic at the base case (when `x` is `O`), since the property holds trivially for the additive identity.\n   - For the inductive step, use the ` eauto` tactic or `clarsimp` with the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus` to simplify the goal.\n   - Complete the proof with `Qed.` to end the theorem proving.\n\n6. Potential Lemmas:\n   - If the proof becomes complex, we might need to prove auxiliary lemmas about the properties of addition in `Z` or the behavior of the functions involved.\n\n7. If we encounter any dead ends, we can consider using `Admitted` for any theorems that are not required to be proved in this context, though it seems there are no such theorems in this particular problem.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to prove the theorem `shift_up1_eq`.\n\n",

The next step is to apply the `eq_rect` tactic on the type of `Z`, which will allow us to prove the equality by induction on `x`. At the base case, when `x` is the additive identity `O`, we use `reflexivity` to automatically close the proof since `f O + 1 = f O + (fun x => 1) O` holds trivially. For the inductive step, we will simplify the expressions using the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`, possibly with the help of `eauto` or `clarsimp` tactics. It is crucial to ensure that each step follows logically from the definitions and previously proven results, maintaining the integrity of the proof.

We can start by analyzing the `Node` constructor in the definition of `tree_height`. For the `tree_example2a` tree, the left subtree is `Node Leaf 8 Leaf` and the right subtree is `Node Leaf 9 Leaf`. The height of a `Leaf` is 0, so the height of the left subtree is `Z.max 0 0 + 1 = 1`. Similarly, the height of the right subtree is also 1. Therefore, the height of `tree_example2a` is `Z.max 1 1 + 1 = 2`, which matches the expected value.\n\nTo formalize this reasoning in Coq, we can use the `match` construct to handle the different cases of the `tree_height` function.

The `tree_size` function is defined recursively and counts the number of nodes in a binary tree, including the root node.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Understand the structure of `tree_example3b`:** We are given that `tree_example3b` is a binary tree. We need to understand its structure to calculate its size. It is defined as a node with value 5, where the left subtree is `tree_example2b` and the right subtree is a node with value 3 and a leaf as its right child.\n\n2. **Recursive Definition of `tree_size`:** The function `tree_size` is defined recursively:\n   - Base case: If the tree is a leaf, its size is 0.\n   - Recursive case: If the tree is a node with left and right subtrees, its size is the sum of the sizes of the left and right subtrees plus one (for the root node itself).\n\n3. **Calculate `tree_size` for `tree_example2b`:** Before we can calculate the size of `tree_example3b`, we need to calculate the size of `tree_example2b`, which is a node with value 100 and two leaves as its subtrees.\n\n4. **Apply the Recursive Definition:**\n   - Calculate the size of the left subtree (`tree_size (Node Leaf 9 Leaf)`), which is 1 (the leaf) + 1 (the root node with value 9) = 2.\n   - Calculate the size of the right subtree (`tree_size (Node Leaf 8 Leaf)`), which is also 2 for the same reason as above.\n   - Add the sizes of both subtrees and the root node of `tree_example2b` to get the total size of `tree_example2b`.\n\n5. **Calculate `tree_size` for `tree_example3b`:** Now, calculate the size of `tree_example3b` by adding the sizes of its left and right subtrees (`tree_size tree_example2b` and `tree_size (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)`) and 1 for the root node with value 5.\n\n6. **Show the Result:**\n   - We should get `tree_size tree_example2b = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5` for the left subtree.\n   - The right subtree size is `tree_size (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n   - Therefore, `tree_size tree_example3b = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8`, which does not match the expected result of 5. There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement or the definition of `tree_example3b`.\n\n7. **Reflect on the Problem:** If the calculation does not yield the expected result, we should re-examine the definitions of `tree_example2b` and `tree_example3b` to ensure they are correct. If they are correct, we may need to reconsider our understanding of the problem or the `tree_size` function.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to prove the theorem or identify any discrepancies in the problem statement.\n",

Given the recursive nature of `tree_size`, we'll need to calculate the size of the subtrees of `tree_example3b` and then add the size of the root node.\n\nThe left subtree of `tree_example3b` is `tree_example2b`, which itself is a node with a value of 100 and two leaves as its children. Using the `tree_size` function, we find that each leaf contributes a size of 0, and the node itself contributes a size of 1. Therefore, the left subtree has a size of `tree_size (Node Leaf 9 Leaf) + 1` which equals `1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nThe right subtree of `tree_example3b` is a node with a value of 3 and a leaf as its right child, giving us a size of `tree_size (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)` which equals `1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nNow, considering `tree_example3b` itself, which is a node with value 5, the total size would be the sum of the sizes of its left and right subtrees plus one for the root node itself: `tree_size tree_example2b + tree_size (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) + 1`. This results in `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.\n\nThus, we can reason that `tree_size tree_example3b` should indeed equal 5, aligning with the target theorem.

Since a leaf tree is simply a tree with no subtrees (i.e., Leaf), and the tree_reverse function reverses the left and right subtrees of a node, it is straightforward to see that reversing a leaf tree will have no effect, as there are no subtrees to reverse.\n\nTo prove this, we can use the reflexivity property of the equality relation, which states that for any value x, x equals x. In this case, we can use reflexivity to show that tree_reverse Leaf is equal to Leaf.\n\nHere is a possible proof script:\n\nProof.\n  simpl.\n  reflexivity.\nQed.\n\nThis script first simplifies the goal using the simpl tactic, which reduces the goal to its simplest form.

It takes a `tree` as input and returns a new `tree` with the left and right subtrees swapped. This function will be crucial in the proof.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the key lemmas**\nTo prove the theorem, we may need to establish some intermediate results. A possible lemma could be:\n`Lemma tree_reverse_idempotent: forall t, tree_reverse (tree_reverse t) = t.`\nThis lemma states that applying `tree_reverse` twice to a tree returns the original tree.\n\n**Step 4: Plan the proof structure**\nThe proof can be structured as follows:\n1. Start by applying the `tree_reverse` function to `tree_example0` and simplify the expression using the definition of `tree_reverse`.\n2. Use the `tree_reverse_idempotent` lemma (if proven) to show that the resulting expression is equal to `tree_example0`.\n3. Use equational reasoning to conclude the proof.\n\n**Step 5: Consider possible proof techniques**\nTo prove the `tree_reverse_idempotent` lemma, we may need to use induction on the structure of the `tree` type. This could involve showing that the lemma holds for the `Leaf` case and the `Node` case.\n\nBy following this plan, we can break down the proof into manageable steps and make progress towards solving the `tree_example0_tree_reverse` theorem.\n",

Since tree_example0 is a Node, we can use the Node case of the induction hypothesis.\n\nThe induction hypothesis in this case states that for any trees l, r and any integer v, if we have tree_reverse l = l and tree_reverse r = r, then tree_reverse (Node l v r) = Node (tree_reverse r) v (tree_reverse l).\n\nWe can see that tree_example0 is indeed a Node with Leaf as both the left and right subtrees, and 1 as the integer value. Therefore, we can apply the induction hypothesis with l = Leaf, v = 1, and r = Leaf.\n\nTo apply the induction hypothesis, we need to show that tree_reverse Leaf = Leaf and tree_reverse Leaf = Leaf.

This will generate two induction hypotheses, `IHl` and `Ir`, which can be used to reason about the left and right subtrees, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to use the `intros` command to introduce the variables `l`, `v`, and `r` before applying the induction hypothesis, as this can make the goal state clearer and easier to reason about.\n\nTherefore, the following sequence of commands could be used to prove the goal:\n\n1. `induction tree_example0 as [| l v r IHl Ir].`\n2. `intros.`\n3. `simpl.`\n4. `try reflexivity.`\n5. `apply IHl.`\n6. `apply Ir.`\n\nThis should allow for a more straightforward proof of the goal.",

Given the definition of `tree_reverse`, this involves showing that the structure of `tree_example3a` when reversed mirrors the structure of `tree_example3b`.

The goal can be reached by systematic application of simplification to see if the resultant structure matches `tree_example3b`. Specifically, start by reversing `tree_example3a`:\n- Break down `tree_example3a` to its constituents: `Node (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) 5 (Node (Node Leaf 8 Leaf) 100 (Node Leaf 9 Leaf))`.\n- Applying the `tree_reverse` will reverse the outer structure's subtrees and recursively apply reverse inside. This should, step-wise, transform the structure in a mirrored version of `tree_example3b`. Each application of `tree_reverse` will switch the respective left and right subtrees and reapply itself to these subtrees.\n\nTo proceed with the proof, consider expanding the application of `tree_reverse` on components of `tree_example3a`, performing simplifications, and use tree structural induction if necessary. Start with the base case where leaf nodes remain leaves and move to nodes where recursive assumptions should lead to a full structure verification.

The `tree_reverse` function reverses the left and right subtrees of each node recursively. \n\nGiven the definitions of `tree_example3a` and `tree_example3b`, we can see that `tree_example3a` is defined as `Node (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) 5 tree_example2a`, and `tree_example3b` is defined as `Node tree_example2b 5 (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)`. Here, `tree_example2a` and `tree_example2b` are similar but have their left and right subtrees swapped.\n\nThe plan to prove this theorem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure**: Recognize that `tree_example3a` and `tree_example3b` are mirror images of each other, with the root value being the same (5), and the left and right subtrees being reversed versions of each other.\n\n2. **Apply `tree_reverse` Function**: Apply the `tree_reverse` function to `tree_example3a` and observe how it transforms the tree. Since `tree_reverse` swaps the left and right subtrees at every node, applying it to `tree_example3a` should result in a tree that matches the structure of `tree_example3b`.\n\n3. **Prove Equality**: Use induction or direct computation to show that the result of `tree_reverse tree_example3a` is indeed equal to `tree_example3b`. This involves showing that the recursive application of `tree_reverse` on `tree_example3a` results in a tree that has the same structure as `tree_example3b`.\n\n4. **Use Known Properties**: If there are any lemmas or properties about `tree_reverse` that have been proven previously, use them to simplify the proof. For example, if there is a lemma stating that reversing a tree twice returns the original tree, this could be useful.\n\n5. **Construct the Proof**: Write out the proof step-by-step, using the above insights to guide the construction. Make sure to justify each step clearly, especially when dealing with the recursive nature of the `tree_reverse` function.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically approach the proof of `tree_example3_tree_reverse`.\n",

The key insight is that `tree_reverse` swaps the left and right subtrees of each node recursively. \n\nSince `tree_example3a` is defined as `Node (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) 5 tree_example2a` and `tree_example3b` is defined as `Node tree_example2b 5 (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)`, applying `tree_reverse` to `tree_example3a` should swap its left and right subtrees, resulting in a tree that matches the structure of `tree_example3b`.\n\nTo proceed, we should apply the `tree_reverse` function to `tree_example3a` and observe the transformation. Given the definition of `tree_reverse`, we know that it will reverse the left and right subtrees of each node. Therefore, applying `tree_reverse` to `tree_example3a` will swap the positions of `Node Leaf 3 Leaf` and `tree_example2a`, resulting in a tree that looks like `Node tree_example2a 5 (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)`.\n\nNext, we need to recognize that `tree_example2a` and `tree_example2b` are mirror images of each other, with their left and right subtrees swapped. Applying `tree_reverse` to `tree_example2a` will transform it into `tree_example2b`. Thus, the overall effect of applying `tree_reverse` to `tree_example3a` will be to produce a tree that is structurally identical to `tree_example3b`.\n\nTherefore, the next step in the proof should involve applying the `tree_reverse` function to `tree_example3a` and then showing that the resulting tree is equal to `tree_example3b`.

We have two constructors: `Leaf` and `Node`. The `Node` constructor takes three arguments: two trees and a value. Our lemma states that if two `Node` structures are equal, their left subtrees must also be equal.\n\n2. **Use the Equality of Trees**: We begin our proof using pattern matching to dissect the equality of the two `Node` values. Specifically, we need to compare the components of the `Node` constructor.\n\n3. **Pattern Matching**: Utilize pattern matching on the hypothesis `H: Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2`. This will allow us to derive sub-properties from the equality of the nodes.\n\n4. **Equate the Values and Subtrees**:\n   - After applying pattern matching, we will have `v1 = v2` and we can apply further reasoning to derive separate equalities for the left and right subtrees.\n   - From the equality of the nodes, we can directly conclude `l1 = l2` and `r1 = r2`, but we are specifically interested in proving `l1 = l2`.\n\n5. **Conclude the Proof**: After establishing `l1 = l2` through the above steps, we use the given equality assumptions to finish our proof.\n\n6. **Admitted Lemmas**: There are no admitted lemmas used in this theorem, so we will base our proof purely on the structural definition of trees.\n\nBy following this plan, we systematically break down the equality of the node constructors to prove the lemma `Node_inj_left`.\n",

The key is to first pattern match on the equality `Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2` within the proof environment, which creates the necessary assumptions about the components of this equality.\n\nSince the historical action attempted the `inversion` on what should have been the hypothesis, but didn't properly capture its context, we should initiate the proof with a clear setup. Therefore, the acting agent should start the proof by reintroducing the hypothesis from the goal statement. \n\nThe next logical step is to use pattern matching on the equality assumption that is part of the goal. We can do this using the exact statement of the lemma, which allows Coq to recognize the corresponding hypothesis. The command should initiate as follows:\n\n1. First, we request pattern matching on the equality `Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2`.\n2. This will provide us with sub-goals that include `v1 = v2`, and importantly for us, the equality for the left subtrees `l1 = l2` which is what we need to conclude.\n\nThis can be implemented by executing the command: \n\n",

These provide necessary functionalities for reasoning about integers, automated proofs and equivalence relations.\n   - Understanding the data structure: Tree is defined inductively with constructors `Leaf` (denoting an empty tree) and `Node` (constructing a tree from two subtrees and a root value).\n\n3. **Plan the Proof**:\n   - **Step 1**: Begin with the `intros` tactic to introduce all hypothesis into the context: `l1 v1 r1 l2 v2 r2` and the equality `Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2`.\n   - **Step 2**: Apply the injectivity of the `Node` constructor. Since `Node l1 v1 r1` is equal to `Node l2 v2 r2`, by definition of equality on constructed values, each corresponding field must be equal (`l1 = l2`, `v1 = v2`, `r1 = r2`). This can typically be achieved via tactics like `injection` followed by the `intros` tactic to extract these conditions from the equality hypothesis.\n   - **Step 3**: From the step above, you should have `r1 = r2` among the extracted conditions. Use the tactic `exact` to complete the proof, as this is what we need to prove.\n\n4. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Ensure there is proper handling of constructors. Misinterpretations could likely lead to contradictions which must be resolved via discarding false hypothesis (`discriminate` tactic can be useful if any arise).\n   - Although not necessary here, remember that sometimes destructuring the conditions to simpler forms (using `destruct` or `case` tactics) could also provide additional pathways of approach if direct injectivity isn't enough.\n\n5. **Completion**:\n   - Conclude the proof with `Qed` to establish the correctness of the theorem.\n",

This should help derive the individual equalities of their respective components (`l1 = l2`, `v1 = v2`, `r1 = r2`). Once these equalities are on the table thanks to the injection, specifically using `intros` will help name these new hypotheses. \n\nLastly, we can directly use `r1 = r2` to conclude the proof, which would essentially respond to the connection already laid out in the hypothesis by the planning phase.

This will allow us to consider both the base case (Leaf) and the inductive case (Node).\n\n3. Handle the base case (Leaf):\n   For the Leaf case, we need to show that the statement holds trivially. This should be straightforward as tree_reverse Leaf is defined to be Leaf.\n\n4. Handle the inductive case (Node):\n   For the Node case, we need to show that assuming tree_reverse (Node l v r) = Leaf leads to a contradiction. This is because tree_reverse of a Node always results in another Node, not a Leaf.\n\nGiven these considerations, I suggest the acting agent start with the following steps:\n\n1.

This is crucial because our definitions of tree_reverse and tree_height are recursive, and induction will allow us to prove the theorem for all possible tree structures.\n\n3.

The theorem to be proven is \"reverse_height\".\n\nStep-by-step proving plan:\n\n1. **Understanding the Definitions**:\n   - The tree is defined recursively with two constructors: `Leaf` for an empty tree, and `Node` with a left subtree (l), a value (v) in Z, and a right subtree (r).\n   - `tree_reverse` function recurses down the tree and swaps the left and right subtrees at each node.\n   - `tree_height` calculates the height of the tree as the maximum height of its left or right subtree plus one, with the height of `Leaf` being zero.\n\n2. **Base Case Analysis**:\n   - Consider the base case where the tree `t` is a `Leaf`. Here, `tree_reverse (Leaf)` yields `Leaf`, and obviously, `tree_height (Leaf)` is 0. \n   - Proving that `tree_height (tree_reverse (Leaf)) = tree_height (Leaf)` simplifies to proving 0 = 0, which is trivial and should be proved directly using `reflexivity`.\n\n3. **Inductive Case Analysis**:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for smaller structures of the tree, that is, assume `tree_height (tree_reverse l) = tree_height l` and `tree_height (tree_reverse r) = tree_height r` for subtrees `l` and `r`.\n   - For a tree `t` = `Node l v r`, `tree_reverse t` yields `Node (tree_reverse r) v (tree_reverse l)`.\n   - Then `tree_height (tree_reverse t)` computes to `Z.max (tree_height (tree_reverse r)) (tree_height (tree_reverse l)) + 1`.\n   - By the induction hypothesis, this can be rewritten as `Z.max (tree_height r) (tree_height l) + 1`.\n   - Note that `Z.max` is commutative, proving that the above expression is equal to `tree_height t`.\n\n4. **Using the Induction Principle on Tree Structure**:\n   - Use structural induction on `t`.\n   - Base case should be the `Leaf`. Prove the property directly as described earlier.\n   - For the inductive case (`Node`), apply the induction hypothesis to `l` and `r`, and then use the properties of the `Z.max` function and the formula for tree height. Rewriting using commutativity of `Z.max` would show the equality holds.\n\n5. **Final Steps**:\n   - Use the `rewrite` tactic to employ the induction hypotheses for subtrees during inductive proof.\n   - Use the `reflexivity` tactic to solve straightforward equalities.\n   - Invoke the lemma about commutativity of `Z.max` whenever required.\n\nThis proof plan leverages the recursive structure of trees to systematically apply induction, utilizing simplification of the `tree_height` function and properties of Z arithmetic.

The fundamental operations were defined, including the recursive definitions of `tree_reverse` and `tree_height`. Key to solving this lemma is understanding that reversing a tree swaps its left and right subtrees, but the height, which depends on the depth of its deepest subtree, remains unaffected. \n\nThe lemma `reverse_height_attempt2` aims to establish equality of tree heights before and after reversal, which requires showing that for every tree `t`, `tree_height (tree_reverse t)` equals `tree_height t`. Given the previously unsuccessful attempt to directly use `rewrite Z.max_comm. reflexivity` without establishing any base or using inductive hypothesis, we need to redo our proof approach under the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the `intros` tactic to handle the universal quantification over the tree `t`.\n2. Utilize `induction` on the structure of `t` to differentiate between the base case when `t` is a `Leaf` and the inductive step when `t` is a `Node`.\n   - For the base case, handling `Leaf`, the equality holds trivially since `tree_height (tree_reverse Leaf) = tree_height Leaf = 0`.\n   - For the inductive case with `Node l v r`, using the induction hypothesis, we relate the heights of the subtrees `l` and `r` with their reversed counterparts.\n3. For the `Node l v r` case, state how tree reversal affects the height, and equate it using properties of `tree_height` function with the `rewrite` tactic applying the induction hypothesis on subtrees. Further, handle Z arithmetic using `lia` or `omega` tactics if necessary.\n4. Finally, show by computation and logical reasoning, using `reflexivity`, that both sides of the equation match.\n\nOverall, these steps enforce the proof strategy by strongly adhering to the recursive structure of the tree and its operations.\n",

Our approach consists of two main parts: the base case and the inductive step.\n\n1. **Base Case**: For the base case, we consider when `t` is `Leaf`. We need to show that `tree_height (tree_reverse Leaf) = tree_height Leaf`. By definition, `tree_reverse Leaf` is `Leaf`, so `tree_height (tree_reverse Leaf)` = `tree_height Leaf` = `0`. This confirms the base case holds.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: For the inductive step, we assume the lemma holds for any trees `l` and `r`, i.e., `tree_height (tree_reverse l) = tree_height l` and `tree_height (tree_reverse r) = tree_height r`. We now need to show that it also holds when `t` is of the form `Node l v r`. \n\n   According to the definition of `tree_reverse`, `tree_reverse t` yields `Node (tree_reverse r) v (tree_reverse l)`.

Therefore:\n   `tree_height (tree_reverse t) = Z.max (tree_height r) (tree_height l) + 1`, which simplifies to `tree_height (Node l v r)` as per the definition of `tree_height`.\n\nThis reasoning confirms that the height of the tree remains unchanged after reversing it, completing the proof for both the base case and the inductive step.

Specifically, the rewriting with `IHl` and `IHr` did not correspond to the correct terms after simplification. The terms from `tree_reverse` must properly relate to the original structures of the subtrees, and this mismatch hindered the proof.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Effectiveness of Past Actions and Thoughts**:\n   The past steps of the proof\u2014specifically, the first goal's simplification and needing to apply inductive hypotheses\u2014were appropriate; however, the application of `rewrite` commands was not conducted accurately. This suggests a misunderstanding of what exactly `IHl` and `IHr` should represent with regard to `tree_reverse`.\n\n3. **Propose Improvements for the Next Steps**:\n   The next steps should involve clearer tracking of how `IHl` and `IHr` correspond to the terms in the expanded definition of `tree_height`.

Each piece of the proof should be refined to ensure that every reference to heights and structures is accurate. By revisiting the definitions and ensuring accurate substitutions, we will better align with the goal of showing the heights of the tree and its reverse are indeed equal.\n\n5. **Is 'Admitted' Used in the Certification Process?**:\n   It is important to avoid using 'Admitted' in the proof, as we aim to complete the entire proof rigorously. Relying on micromega tactics such as `Psatz` may also be useful once the algebraic simplifications show the necessary structure, but the initial steps must be properly validated first without shortcuts.\n\nBy following these insights and focusing on properly applying the induction hypotheses, we should have sufficient structure to move forward successfully in proving the lemma `reverse_height_attempt2`.",

We will use a subgoal tactic to break down the proof into two implications:\n   a. Prove the first implication: (forall a: A, P a -> Q a) -> (forall a: A, ~ Q a -> ~ P a)\n   b. Prove the second implication: (forall a: A, ~ Q a -> ~ P a) -> (forall a: A, P a -> Q a)\n4. For the first subgoal, use the 'intros' tactic to introduce a hypothesis for the implication, let's call it H1.\n5. Apply the 'clarsimp' tactic to simplify the goal and eliminate any easy implications.\n6. Use the 'left' tactic to focus on the first part of the proof, which is proving (forall a: A, P a -> Q a).\n7. Introduce a new hypothesis a : A using 'intros' and then another hypothesis Pa for P(a) using 'intros' again.\n8. Apply the 'assumption' tactic to use H1 in the proof that P(a) -> Q(a).\n9. For the second subgoal, repeat the process starting from step 4, but now focus on proving the contrapositive using the 'right' tactic.\n10. Once both implications are proved, use the ' Qed' tactic to close the proof.\n\nNote that the theorem to be proved is a biconditional statement, but the given Fact only requires proving one direction. If the problem expects proving both directions, the plan should be adjusted to include proving the second implication as well.\n\nAdditionally, depending on the complexity of the propositions P and Q, additional lemmas or simplifications may be required. If the proof seems too complex, consider applying 'split' to break down the proof further or using ' eauto' with appropriate eauto tactics to automate some steps.\n\nCoq code skeleton for the proof:\n\n",
                "reasoning": "\nThe current observation indicates that the 'clarsimp' tactic, which was intended to simplify the goal, is not recognized in the Coq environment. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the tactic not being loaded or a typo in the tactic name. Given that 'clarsimp' is a common tactic that should be available in standard Coq distributions, it's possible that the environment may be misconfigured or the tactic may not have been properly imported.\n\nTo address this issue and continue with the proof, we should replace 'clarsimp' with an alternative tactic that achieves a similar level of simplification. The 'eauto' tactic is a general-purpose simplifier that can be used here. Additionally, since the 'clarsimp' tactic was followed by 'left', which is used to focus on the left side of a disjunction, we should also include that in our revised command.\n\nThe acting agent should now execute the following tactics: 'intros A P Q H1' to introduce the universal quantification, 'eauto' to simplify the goal, and then 'left' to focus on proving the first implication. After that, 'intros a Pa' should be used to introduce a new hypothesis for the element 'a' and the proposition 'P a'. Finally, 'assumption' can be used to complete the proof of this subgoal by using the hypothesis 'H1'.\n\nHere is the revised sequence of tactics:\n",

Use `intros` to bring `P`, `Q`, `R` and the implications into the context.\n   - Utilize the disjunction `P \\/ Q` to facilitate a proof by cases. \n\n4. **Proof by Cases**:\n   - Apply the disjunction elimination rule on `P \\/ Q` using `destruct` or similar tactics. This will create two cases to handle: one where `P` is true and another where `Q` is true.\n   - In each case, use the corresponding implication to prove `R`. For the case where `P` holds, use the hypothesis `(P -> R)` to conclude `R`. Similarly, use `(Q -> R)` for the case where `Q` holds.\n\n5. **Complete the Proof**: After handling both cases, employ `Qed` to complete the proof.

This would bring `P, Q, R` as variables and `(P -> R), (Q -> R)` as hypotheses, which are direct implications that would be required later. \n\nOnce `P \\/ Q` is on the table from the introspection, `destruct` can be applied to this disjunction, dividing the problem into two separate cases:\n1.

This theorem is a classical logic theorem applying the basic property of a disjunction (OR operation), where if one of the operands is true, the whole statement is true.\n\n1. Import Required Libraries:\n   - Start with importing all the necessary libraries such as ZArith, micromega.Psatz, Setoids.Setoid, and Classical_Prop. These imports make sure that we have the necessary mathematical and logical tools available, like `Z` for integers and logical operations.\n\n2. Understanding and Using the Theorem 'or_introl':\n   - The theorem 'or_introl' states that if we know `A` is true, then `A \\/ B` must be true for any `B`.\n   - It can be interpreted formally as:\n     Given a proposition `A` and another proposition `B`, if proposition `A` holds (`A ->`), one can infer `A \\/ B`.\n\n3. Proof Strategy for `or_introl`:\n   - **Start the Proof**: Begin by stating the theorem in Coq using `Theorem or_introl : ...`.\n   - **Introduce Hypotheses**: Introduce the assumptions needed for the proof. Here, we assume `A` is true and `B` can be any proposition (`forall A B : Prop, A -> A \\/ B`).\n   - **Apply Introduction Rule for Disjunction**: Since we know `A` holds, use the disjunction introduction rule (left) to introduce `A \\/ B`. In Coq, this would typically be done using tactics like `left` after assuming `A` to be true.\n   - **Close the Proof**: Use the `Qed` or `Defined` keyword to close the proof correctly.\n\n4. General Tips:\n   - Be careful to manage the scope of propositions `A` and `B`. Ensure proper handling of universal quantification.\n   - Use simple and direct tactics. Here, the proof is straightforward because we only need to assert the truth of `A \\/ B` based on the truth of `A`.\n\nWith these steps, the theorem `or_introl` can be proved simply by asserting the left side of the disjunction due to the direct application of logical rules associated with OR operation.\n",

Since `A` is known to be true and `B` can be any proposition without any condition, the strategy should focus on employing the disjunction introduction rule. Specifically, the rule that states if one part of a disjunction is true, the entire statement must be true (`A -> A \\/ B`). The Coq tactic `left` is suited for this, as it allows us to focus on proving the left side of the disjunction (`A`), which we are given as true by the premise of the theorem. Hence, the next step should involve using the `left` tactic to directly assert `A \\/ B` based on `A` being true.\n",

This brings `P` into scope as `forall P : Prop`.\n   - Apply the `split` tactic to handle the bi-implication (`<->`). This divides the proof into two subgoals:\n     - Prove `P -> P`\n     - Prove `P -> P` again for the other direction.\n\n4. **Prove Both Directions**:\n   - For `P -> P`, utilize the `intro` tactic to assume `P` is true.\n   - Since the assumption is that P holds, you can directly use `apply` or `assumption` to establish `P` in both sub-goals.\n\n5. **Close the Proof**:\n   - Use the `exact` or `assumption` tactic in Coq to conclude the proof for both directions.\n   - To finalize, use `Qed` to complete the proof which encapsulates the verification that P indeed implies itself in both directions due to the reflexivity of implication in logic.\n\n6. **Final Steps and Validation**:\n  - Compile the proof script in Coq to ensure correctness.\n  - Reflect on any redundancy or optimization errors in the proof.\n\nThis guided plan leverages straightforward logical tactics reflecting on the reflexivity property of equivalence (`<->`) and should facilitate a clear and concise proof in Coq. \n",

The split is necessary because the `<->` operator is bi-conditional, meaning it represents two implications: one from left to right (forward direction) and another from right to left (backward direction). By using `split`, we can handle these two directions separately, transforming our main goal into two sub-goals:\n1. Show `P -> P`\n2. Similarly, show `P -> P` for the return direction\n\nIn each of these sub-goals, we can use the `intro` tactic, which will allow us to assume P (the hypothesis of the implication). Given that our sub-goal and hypothesis are exactly the same in both cases, we can directly conclude them by applying the assumption itself.\n\nUsing the `assumption` tactic provides an effective way to dispatch each of these sub-goals because it matches the goal with existing hypotheses in the proof environment.

This means we need to show both directions of the equivalence: `P -> P` and `P <- P`.\n\n2. **Using the Definition of `<->`**: \n   - The notation `P <-> Q` is usually defined as `(P -> Q) /\\ (Q -> P)`. Therefore, we need to prove that:\n     - `P -> P` (which is trivially true)\n     - `P <- P` (which is also trivially true).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:\n   - Begin the proof by introducing the proposition `P`.\n   - Use the `split` tactic to separate into two goals: prove `P -> P` and `P <- P`.\n   - For the goal `P -> P`, you can use the `intros` tactic to introduce `H: P`, and then apply `exact H` to conclude that if `P` holds, then `P` holds.\n   - Similarly, for the goal `P <- P`, use the same steps to show that if `P` holds, then `P` holds in the reverse direction.\n\n4. **Conclude the Proof**: After proving both directions, use the `reflexivity` tactic or simply finish the proof with the required tactics to complete the proof obligation.\n\nBy following this plan, we will construct a direct proof of the theorem using basic tactics in Coq.\n\n",

This is typically done using the `intros` tactic.\n\n2. **Split the Goal**: The next step is to use the `split` tactic since we need to prove a conjunction of two implications: `P -> P` and `P <- P`.\n\n3. **Proving `P -> P`**: For the first goal (`P -> P`), the agent should use the `intros` tactic to assume `H: P` and then use the `exact H` tactic to conclude that if `P` holds, then `P` holds.\n\n4. **Proving `P <- P`**: After proving the first implication, the second goal (`P <- P`) can be addressed similarly by using the `intros` tactic to assume `H2: P` and again concluding with `exact H2`.\n\nBy following these steps, we will effectively guide the acting agent through the proof structure, ensuring that they utilize Coq's tactics to constructively demonstrate the equivalence. \n\nIn short, the next action should involve introducing `P`, splitting the goal, and proving both implications. \n\nThis structured approach captures the essence of the planned proof, leading to a successful completion of the theorem.\n\n",

Overview:\n   - We are provided with the theorem \"and_dup\" which states that for any proposition P, having P and P together (P /\\ P) is logically equivalent to just having P (P). This translates to demonstrating that both:\n     a) the conjunction of P with itself implies P, and \n     b) P implies the conjunction of P with itself.\n\n2. Required Libraries and Scope:\n   - Importation of necessary libraries including ZArith, micromega.Psatz, Setoids.Setoid, and Logic.Classical_Prop have been done.\n   - The scope is set to Z.\n\n3. Definitions:\n   - The 'Prop' here refers to propositional logic expressions.\n   - The '/' operator signifies logical equivalence.\n   - The '/\\' operator signifies logical conjunction.\n\n4. Breakdown of the Theorem (and_dup):\n   - The theorem can be dissected into two main parts to demonstrate equivalence:\n      i) Proving that (P /\\ P) implies P.\n      ii) Proving that P implies (P /\\ P).\n\n5. Proof Strategy:\n   i) Proving (P /\\ P) implies P:\n      - From the definition of logical conjunction, if you have P /\\ P, you can infer P (by projecting either side of the conjunction since both are P).\n      - Use tactics like \"intros\" to assume (P /\\ P) is true and extract P using \"destruct\" or \"tauto\".\n\n   ii) Proving P implies (P /\\ P):\n      - If P is true, then P /\\ P, which is just P and again P, should also hold true.\n      - Start by assuming P using \"intro\" tactic and use \"split\" to achieve P and P from the accessible assumption.\n      \n6. Simplification and Concluding the Proof:\n   - After establishing both implications, use 'tauto' for automated logical simplification or 'split' to combine both implications to conclude the proof whatsoever.\n   - Applying these strategies sequentially via appropriate tactic applications like 'split', 'intro', 'destruct', and 'tauto' should lead to a completed proof.\n\n7. Summary:\n   - The essence of and_dup is to portray that stating a proposition twice in conjunction doesn\u2019t change its logical value\u2014a fundamental concept in logic simplification.\n   - Attention must be paid to proper application of tactics and understanding of logical conjunction and implications for a smooth proof.\n",
                "reasoning": "\nFrom the problem and plan above, we have the theorem \"and_dup\" which states the logical equivalence of P /\\ P and P. To begin proving this, we must first address the two components identified in the planning: \n   1) Proving (P /\\ P) implies P, and \n   2) Proving P implies (P /\\ P).\n\nFor the first component, reasoning is that if we have an assumption of P /\\ P, it logically follows that we have both instances of P occurring simultaneously. In logical terms, this simply means extracting one instance of P, as both parts of the conjunction are identical. The tactics 'destruct' or 'tauto' would be ideal for revealing P from P /\\ P.\n\nFor the second component, with the assumption that P is true, the implication involving P -> (P /\\ P) essentially needs us to illustrate that given P, both sides of (P /\\ P) are satisfied with this same single instance of P. Reasoning suggests using 'split' to fulfill the two required instances of P from the single, available true assumption of P.\n\nThe overall reasoning for the acting stage would be to start with presentation of the equivalence, advancing into proving each implication as laid out, primarily using the tactics like 'intro', 'destruct', 'split', and potentially 'tauto' to leverage simplification where possible. Conclude the proof using either a combined tactical approach or a simplification approach like 'tauto'.\n",

This theorem is a classic example of a proof by contradiction, also known as reductio ad absurdum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to prove the theorem:\n\n1. Begin by stating the theorem to be proved.\n2. Introduce the hypothesis `P -> ~P`. This is the assumption that will lead to a contradiction.\n3. Use the Classical Proposition library, which is already imported, to work with the law of excluded middle if necessary.\n4. Derive a contradiction from the hypothesis. Since `P` and `~P` cannot both be true at the same time, having both as true leads to a contradiction.\n5. From this contradiction, we can infer any proposition Q (this is the principle of explosion or ex falso quodlibet).\n6. Conclude the proof by using the contradiction to prove Q.\n\nThe Coq code for the proof could look like this:\n\nProof not_ex2.\n  intros P Q H.  (* Introduce P, Q, and the hypothesis P -> ~P *)\n  apply H.       (* Apply the hypothesis *)\n  contradiction. (* Derive the contradiction from P and ~P *)\n  exact I.      (* Use the contradiction to prove Q *)\nQed.\n\nThis plan assumes that the player is familiar with Coq's proof tactics and the imported libraries.

The theorem 'not_ex2' is a classic example of a proof by contradiction, which relies on demonstrating that the assumption 'P -> ~P' leads to a logical inconsistency, allowing us to conclude Q.\n\nThe acting agent should start the proof by introducing the theorem and the necessary hypothesis. The first step would be to introduce P and Q using the 'intros' tactic, followed by applying the hypothesis 'H' using the 'apply' tactic. After this, the agent should aim to derive a contradiction from the assumption that P and ~P are both true, which can be done using the 'contradiction' tactic in Coq.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with the proof as follows:\n\n1. Introduce P and Q with the 'intros' tactic.\n2. Apply the hypothesis 'H' to work with the assumption P -> ~P.\n3. Use the 'contradiction' tactic to derive a contradiction from the assumption that P and ~P are both true.\n4. Finally, use the 'exact I' tactic to conclude that Q must be true based on the derived contradiction.\n\nThe acting agent should execute the proof in Coq IDE with the following code:\n\nProof not_ex2.\n  intros P Q H.

To do this, we must show that assuming P leads to a contradiction (that Q must be false) considering `NPQ`. The failed attempt to apply 'classic' disrupted the logical examination, as it tries to introduce unnecessary assumptions about P or Q individually being possibly untrue, which is not supported directly by `NPQ`.\n\nTherefore, we can backtrack to the earlier correct step and use a direct proof by showing the negation of both propositions. To do this, it is helpful to revert to the point before the 'classic' application, consider `P` as true, and show it leads to `~ Q` using `apply NPQ`, and similarly for `Q` leading to `~ P`. The refinement should be to use the natural implication that if either P or Q is true, given the premise of `~ (P /\\ Q)`, showing the other is false would directly lead to proving `~ P \\/ ~ Q`.\n\nThis approach will ensure that we do not extend beyond our logical assumptions and will keep the proof strictly related to what is derivable from `NPQ`.\n",

We have to show this equivalence, which typically involves proving two implications:\n\n\n1. `~ ~ P -> P`: \n   Strategy: To prove this, assume `~ ~ P` holds (i.e., it is not the case that `P` is false). Then use the law of excluded middle (classical reasoning), which allows us to assume that either `P` or `~P` holds. Given that `~ ~ P` and using contradiction, show that `~ P` leads to a contradiction thereby establishing `P`.\n\n2. `P -> ~ ~ P`: \n   Strategy: To prove this, assume that `P` holds. Now show that `~ P` leads to a contradiction, thus establishing `~ ~ P`. This is a direct use of contradiction.\n\n\nTo complete this proof we should:\n- Start by opening the scope for arithmetic operations on integers (`Z`) because sometimes properties or lemmas about numbers might be useful in logical proofs (even if it might not be directly apparent in this specific proof).\n- Import useful libraries:\n  - `Coq.ZArith.ZArith` for integer arithmetic.\n  - `Coq.micromega.Psatz` for automated proving of arithmetic goals.\n  - `Coq.Setoids.Setoid` for equivalence relations and rewriting.\n  - `Coq.Logic.Classical_Prop` for classical logic properties, especially the law of excluded middle.\n- Use `Local Open Scope Z` to allow Z operations to be performed without qualifying them.\n\nRemember, for proving each direction in the equivalence, make assumptions as stipulated and strategically apply contradiction and classical reasoning to reach the conclusion.

This requires proving two directions: `~ ~ P -> P` and `P -> ~ ~ P`.\n\nStart by tackling the first implication `~ ~ P -> P`:\n1. Assume `~ ~ P` (double negation of P). \n2. Using the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM), assert that either `P` is true, or `P` is false (`P \\/ ~P`).\n3. By the assumption `~ ~ P`, if we assume `~P` (P is false) under the scope of a contradiction, we can use the assumption `~ ~ P` to derive a contradiction because `~ ~ P` and `~P` cannot both be true. This contradiction implies `P` must be true.\n4. Hence, from `~ ~ P`, we've derived `P`.\n\nFor proving the second implication `P -> ~ ~ P`:\n1. Assume `P` (P is true).\n2. To prove `~ ~ P`, assume `~ P` (negation of P) towards deriving a contradiction.\n3. Since `P` (assumed true) and `~P` (assumed for contradiction) cannot both hold, we get a contradiction.\n4. Thus, from `P`, we have shown `~ ~ P` by contradiction.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the next step would be to start with the first implication proof, applying the tactics of assuming `~ ~ P` and using the law of excluded middle to setup a proof by contradiction for `~ P` leading to `P`.\n",

First and foremost, it appears there were syntactical errors with destructing a hypothesis incorrectly named and scoped. The error messages indicate confusion about the identifiers used during the 'destruct' tactic.\n\nThe main reasoning strategy should revolve around accurately understanding the structure of the hypothesis to correctly apply 'destruct'. This means being precise about how the hypothesis is introduced and into what components it is split:\n\n1. We should first introduce the hypothesis properly using 'intros'. This will allow for correctly naming the hypothesis that reflects the splitting of \"(P \\/ Q) \\/ R\".\n\n2. Once introduced correctly, we should ensure the use of 'destruct' corresponds to the actual identifiers that represent the components of the hypothesis. Given the initial plan, the correctly introduced hypothesis would likely name the combination of disjunctions in a manner similar to 'H'. Destructing it should lead to separate cases where the subcomponents are either \"(P \\/ Q)\" or \"R\".\n\n3. Each subsection of the destruct should correspond to the possible cases of the disjunction:\n   - If the left side of the main disjunction holds (P \\/ Q), further destruct it to get P and Q cases.\n   - If the right side holds (R), it should immediately lead to constructing the required \"P \\/ (Q \\/ R)\" using the right parts of disjunctions.\n\nTo proceed correctly:\n- Start with an accurate 'intros' to name the compound hypothesis.\n- Apply 'destruct' carefully to split the hypothesis into logical segments respecting the logical structure of \"(P \\/ Q) \\/ R\".\n- For each segment after destructing, employ either the 'left' or 'right' tactic judiciously to construct \"P \\/ (Q \\/ R)\" based on which segment of the disjunction holds.\n\nBy focusing sharply on the precise execution of these tactics and the logical construction they aim to build, the next steps in the proof should progressively close the goal.

Each direction might then be further compacted using `apply` or `auto` to reflect the inferential moves enabled by our starting assumptions (`P1 <-> P2` and `Q1 <-> Q2`).\n\nIn essence, the most relevant Coq tactics to employ here would include `intros` and `split` for structure creation, followed by `apply` and `auto` that could make use of the logical equivalences drawn from the initial hypotheses. This not only aligns well with our overall plan but provides a clear pathway to kickstart the proof in Coq.\n",

To guide the acting agent towards effectively advancing the proof, focus should be shifted back to the scope where `Hyp` is defined.\n\nFrom the strategic breakdown in the planning phase, and the two main goals derived post the `split` tactic, we should carefully resume the induction on `Hyp` and `PR`. The first sub-proof, `(P \\/ Q -> R) -> (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)`, was partially addressed but halted due to the errors arising from context mishandling. The agent should reinitiate by deconstructing the implication `(P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)` using the conjunction introduction (typically applied through `split` in Coq), this time correctly introducing and applying assumptions.\n\nTo clear the confusion, the right move currently is to restore the integrity of the interactive environment by clearing any introduced error state and correctly reintroduce the hypothesis. This can be done by invoking `intros Hyp` to bring the hypothesis `(P \\/ Q -> R)` back into scope afresh and then moving forward to split the conjunction `(P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)` properly. Once this is managed successfully, the next steps to guide the proof would include using appropriate tactics such as `intros` for assumption introduction and managing disjunction application via `left` and `right` accurately by keeping track of the focused proof environment.\n\nBy careful deployment of `intros` for assumption management, and correct application of disjunction with `left` or `right`, we can systematically lead both the sub-goals `(P -> R)` and `(Q -> R)` to their respective conclusions which collectively satisfy the condition `(P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)`.\n",

This is a statement about the symmetric nature of existentially quantified statements over two variables in the properties they describe.\n\n2. **Key Strategy**:\n   - The proof of this theorem essentially hinges on demonstrating that the order of the existential quantifiers does not matter when the underlying property `P` is applicable symmetrically to `(x, y)` and `(y, x)`. \n\n3. **Proof Approach**:\n   - **Direct Approach** using the implication in both directions:\n     a. **(->) Forward Direction**:\n        - Assume `(exists x y, P x y)` where `x` and `y` are instances satisfying `P`.\n        - From this, you can directly assert `(exists y x, P x y)` because the same instances `x` and `y` that made the initial statement true satisfy the swapped version. This step exploits the non-specificity of the binding of `x` and `y`.\n        \n     b. **(<-) Reverse Direction**:\n        - Assume `(exists y x, P x y)`.\n        - Similarly, directly conclude `(exists x y, P x y)` using the same reasoning as in the forward direction.\n\n   - In each part, leverage existential quantifiers' properties, especially focusing on how the instantiation of variables from the hypothesis can satisfy the conclusion.\n\n4. **Using Coq Features**:\n    - Utilize basic tactics like `intros`, `exists`, and `assumption` which align with handling existential proofs.\n    - Remember to manage scope via `Local Open Scope Z` to handle the integer type assumptions appropriately.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n    - After proposing your proof, test each direction separately for logical consistency.\n    - If any assumptions need classical propositions, use the imported `Classical_Prop`.\n\nBy following this structured plan, the proof of `exists_exists` can be effectively streamlined with precise logical reasoning and efficient utilization of Coq\u2019s capabilities.\n",
                "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem `exists_exists`, you need to demonstrate the equivalency of the statements involving existential quantifiers with transposed variables `(x, y)` and `(y, x)`. The key step is building a logical argument establishing that having an instance of `(x, y)` automatically provides an instance of `(y, x)` with the same property `P` satisfying both scenarios, and vice versa.\n\nBeginning with the `(->)` direction:\n- Assume `exists x y, P x y`. This means there are specific elements `x` and `y` in respective types `X` and `Y` such that `P x y` holds true.\n- The objective is to establish the existence of these elements, but this time in the order `(y, x)`, which directly follows since the elements fulfilling `P x y` can simply be transposed to demonstrate `exists y x, P x y`.\n\nNow, addressing the `(<-)` direction:\n- The assumption here is `exists y x, P x y`. This asserts the presence of elements `y` and `x` such that `P x y` is true.\n- By leveraging the same reasoning as in the forward direction, reverse the order of these elements from `(y, x)` back to `(x, y)` to confirm `exists x y, P x y`.\n\nIn both proof directions, what you are capitalizing on is the fact that the existential quantifiers\u2019 truth is based solely on the presence of elements satisfying the predicate `P`. The logical argument is quite straightforward since it operates purely on the rearrangement property, irrelevant of the particularity or specifics of `X`, `Y`, or `P`.\n\nWith this reasoning in mind, the next appropriate steps in Coq would be using basic tactics like `intros` to bring into scope the necessary assumptions, and `exists` to specify the elements witnessing the predicate, followed by `assumption` or direct usage of the predicates to fulfill the goals.

This involves showing that `add O (S m)` equals `S (add O m)`.\n    - By definition of `add`, `add O (S m)` simplifies to `S m`.\n    - Also, `add O m` simplifies to `m`, so `S (add O m)` simplifies to `S m`.\n    - Therefore, `add O (S m)` equals `S (add O m)`.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number `n'` (inductive hypothesis), and then prove it for `S n'` (the successor of `n'`).\n    - The inductive hypothesis is `forall m, add n' (S m) = S (add n' m)`.\n    - We need to show that `add (S n') (S m)` equals `S (add (S n') m)`.\n    - By definition of `add`, `add (S n') (S m)` simplifies to `S (add n' (S m))`.\n    - Using the inductive hypothesis, `add n' (S m)` equals `S (add n' m)`, so `S (add n' (S m))` simplifies to `S (S (add n' m))`.\n    - Also, `add (S n') m` simplifies to `S (add n' m)`, so `S (add (S n') m)` simplifies to `S (S (add n' m))`.\n    - Therefore, `add (S n') (S m)` equals `S (add (S n') m)`.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, the lemma `add_succ_r` is true for all natural numbers `n` and `m`.\n\nThis plan uses the principle of mathematical induction to systematically prove the lemma, leveraging the recursive structure of the `add` function and the properties of natural numbers.\n",

According to the planning strategy, our first step should be to initiate the proof by induction on `n`. \n\nThe base case involves proving the statement for `n = O`. Based on the definition of `add`, we know that `add O (S m)` simplifies directly to `S m`, and `S (add O m)` also simplifies to `S m` since `add O m` is `m`. Thus, the base case is straightforward and can be proven using reflexivity.\n\nFor the inductive step, we assume the statement holds for some `n'` (inductive hypothesis), and we need to prove it for `S n'`. We will use the inductive hypothesis to simplify the expression `add (S n') (S m)` to `S (add n' (S m))`, and then further simplify it to `S (S (add n' m))` using the inductive hypothesis. Similarly, `S (add (S n') m)` simplifies to `S (S (add n' m))`. Hence, the inductive step can be completed by applying the inductive hypothesis and simplifying the expressions accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to start the proof by induction on `n` and proceed with proving the base case and the inductive step as outlined.\n",

                "reasoning": "\nTo guide the acting agent on the next proving operation, we should refocus our approach based on the reflection analysis and ensuring proper structure in our proof.\n\n1. **Base Case**: Since we are working on proving `add_comm`, the first step involves stating the base case where `n` is `O`. Rewrite the goal to reflect this scenario: we want to show that `add O m = add m O`. This is a straightforward case that simplifies to `m = m`, which is trivially true. We can use `rewrite add_0_r` correctly here, but since the previous attempts showed errors in matching the terms, let's ensure we clearly express our goal.\n\n2. **Setting Induction**: We have already begun the induction hypothesis, so after dealing with the base case, we should proceed to state the inductive step explicitly without jumping to lemmas prematurely. Our hypothesis is that the statement holds for some natural number `n` (i.e., `add n m = add m n`), leading us to need to show this for `S n`.\n\n3. **Inductive Step**: When you're in the inductive case, rewrite the term `add (S n) m` using `add_succ_r`. This gives us `S (add n m)`, and we need to do the same for `add m (S n)` using the lemma `add_succ_r`, which gives `S (add m n)`. Now, we need to manipulate our results to use the induction hypothesis on the `add n m = add m n` part.\n\nCorrectly structuring these steps will ensure clarity and correctness. Make sure you initially state the goal as the base case before performing simplifications or rewrites, and then follow through with the induction hypothesis neatly.\n\nIn summary, restructure your proof to focus first on establishing the base case, then clearly stating the induction hypothesis before proceeding to the inductive step, ensuring lemmas are applied in the correct order and context.\n\nImplement the above steps accordingly in your proof. \n",

Note how the recursion reduces the first argument to zero using the successor function, ultimately returning the second argument when the first is zero.\n\n2. **Using Inductive Reasoning:**\n   - The nature of the `add` function suggests the use of induction for proofs, particularly induction on `p` (since it directly influences the recursive behavior of `add`).\n\n3. **Proof Strategy:**\n   - **Step 1:** Apply induction on `p`:\n     - **Base Case (p = O):**\n       - Show `add O n = add O m <-> n = m`\n       - This simplifies to `n = m <-> n = m`, which is true by reflexivity.\n     - **Inductive Step (Assume for p, prove for S p):**\n       - The inductive hypothesis will be `add p n = add p m <-> n = m`.\n       - Need to prove `add (S p) n = add (S p) m <-> n = m`, which simplifies to `S (add p n) = S (add p m) <-> n = m`.\n       - Using the injectivity of `S`, this can be reduced to `add p n = add p m <-> n = m`, thus closing the loop with the inductive hypothesis.\n\n4. **Reflection and Adjustment:**\n   - At each step in both the base and inductive cases, ensure correct application of definitions and previous results, such as injectivity of S.\n   - The key challenge will be making sure the inductive hypothesis is appropriately formulated and applied.\n\n5. **Helper Lemmas and Known Results:**\n   - The injectivity of the successor function `S` (i.e., if `S x = S y` then `x = y`) can be crucial in simplifying terms inside the proof.\n\nThis plan seizes on the recursive nature of `add` and uses induction to handle the progressive definition.

The function reduces the first argument (in this case `p`) by recursively calling itself with the predecessor of `p` until it hits the base case of `O`. The use of induction is apt because every recursive call reduces `p` by one until it reaches the base condition.\n\nFor the base case when `p` is zero, `add O n` reduces directly to `n`, and similarly `add O m` reduces to `m`. Therefore, proving this base case is straightforward as it simply implies that `n = m`.\n\nFor the inductive step, assuming the theorem holds for some `p`, we must show it also holds when `p` becomes `S p`. The function application `add (S p) n` will increment `add p n` by one using the successor function `S`, and similarly for `add (S p) m`. Thus, proving that `S (add p n) = S (add p m)` is equivalent to `n = m` will use the hypothesis that `add p n = add p m` is equivalent to `n = m`. Here, the key is the injectivity of `S`, which allows us to remove the `S` on both sides of the equality, leading us directly to apply the inductive hypothesis.\n\nHaving this thorough understanding assists in recognizing the importance of each step in the planned proof and ensures the use of correct application of the inductive hypothesis and known properties like the injective nature of the `S` function.\n",

Here, we assume that `mul n O = O` for some arbitrary `n` (inductive hypothesis), and we need to prove that `mul (S n) O = O`. Using the definition of `mul`, we know that `mul (S n) O` is equivalent to `add O (mul n O)`. By our inductive hypothesis, `mul n O` simplifies to `O`, so we need to prove that `add O O = O`. Again, this is true by the definition of `add`, where adding `O` to any number results in that number itself, and in this case, it is `O`.\n\nThus, the next step in the proof should be to apply the `induction` tactic on `n` to set up the inductive proof structure, and then proceed to prove both the base case and the inductive step as outlined.\n",

Here's a strategic plan to approach this proof:\n\n1. **Understand the Definitions**: Recall the definitions of `add` and `mul`:\n    - `add` is defined recursively, where adding zero to any number `m` results in `m`, and adding the successor of a number `n'` to `m` results in the successor of `add n' m`.\n    - `mul` is also defined recursively, where multiplying zero by any number `m` results in zero, and multiplying the successor of a number `p` by `m` results in the sum of `m` and `mul p m`.\n\n2. **Base Case Analysis**: Consider the base case where `n` is `O`. According to the definition of `mul`, `mul O (S m)` should equal `O`. On the other hand, `add (mul O m) O` also equals `O` because `mul O m` is `O` and adding `O` to any number results in that number itself. Thus, the base case holds.\n\n3. **Inductive Step**: Assume the lemma holds for some arbitrary `n`, i.e., `mul n (S m) = add (mul n m) n`. We need to show that it also holds for `S n`, i.e., `mul (S n) (S m) = add (mul (S n) m) (S n)`.\n    - By the definition of `mul`, `mul (S n) (S m)` is `add (S m) (mul n (S m))`.\n    - Using the inductive hypothesis, replace `mul n (S m)` with `add (mul n m) n`.\n    - This gives us `add (S m) (add (mul n m) n)`.\n    - Use the associativity of addition (`add_assoc`) to rearrange the terms.\n    - Finally, simplify the expression to match the right-hand side of the lemma.\n\n4. **Use Known Lemmas**: Utilize the lemma `add_succ_r` which states that adding a successor to a number is equivalent to taking the successor of the sum. This can help in simplifying expressions involving successors during the proof.\n\n5. **Construct the Proof**: Start the proof with `intros` to introduce the variables `n` and `m`. Then, use induction on `n`. For each case, apply the appropriate definitions and lemmas to reach the conclusion.\n\nBy following these steps, you can construct a rigorous and clear proof for the lemma `mul_succ_r`.\n",

The base case will involve showing that the lemma holds when `n` is `O`, and the inductive step will assume the lemma holds for some `n` and then prove it for `S n`.\n\nThe reasoning behind starting with `intros` is to set up the environment for the proof, making the variables `n` and `m` available for manipulation.

This induction will first handle the base case where `m` is zero (applying lemmas like `mul_0_r` accurately within this specific scenario), then assume the commutativity for a generic `m` (induction hypothesis), and finally prove it for the successor of `m` using `mul_succ_r`, the induction hypothesis, and potentially `add_comm`.\n\nIn brief, a refined approach considering induction should provide a structured path to prove the theorem `mul_comm` correctly.\n",

                "planning_context": "\nTo prove the theorem `mul_add_distr_r`, which states that multiplication distributes over addition from the right, we need to leverage the definition of `mul` and `add` as well as the already proven theorem `add_assoc`. Here's a strategic plan to approach this proof:\n\n1. **Understand the Definitions**: First, recall the definitions of `add` and `mul`:\n    - `add` is defined recursively, where adding zero to any number `m` results in `m`, and adding `S n'` (the successor of `n'`) to `m` results in the successor of `add n' m`.\n    - `mul` is also defined recursively, where multiplying zero by any number `m` results in zero, and multiplying the successor of `p` by `m` results in the sum of `m` and `mul p m`.\n\n2. **Base Case for `mul`**: Consider the base case where `n` is `O` (zero). We need to show that `mul (add O m) p = add (mul O p) (mul m p)`. Since `mul O p` is `O` and `add O m` is `m`, this simplifies to showing that `mul m p = mul m p`, which is trivially true.\n\n3. **Inductive Step for `mul`**: Assume the theorem holds for some `n` and prove it for `S n` (the successor of `n`). We need to show that `mul (add (S n) m) p = add (mul (S n) p) (mul m p)`. Using the definition of `mul`, this becomes `mul (S (add n m)) p = add (add p (mul n p)) (mul m p)`.\n\n4. **Use Associativity of Addition**: To simplify the expression, use the associativity of addition (`add_assoc`) to rearrange terms. This will help in aligning the structure of the expressions on both sides of the equation.\n\n5. **Recursive Application**: Apply the inductive hypothesis to the recursive part of the `mul` function, and simplify the resulting expression to match the desired form.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: After simplifying and applying the necessary transformations, conclude the proof by showing that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side.\n\nThis plan leverages the recursive nature of `mul` and `add`, the associativity of addition, and the principle of mathematical induction to construct a rigorous proof.\n",

According to our planning strategy, the first step is to consider the base case where `n` is `O` (zero).\n\nLet's start by considering the base case explicitly. When `n` is `O`, the left-hand side of the equation `mul (add O m) p` simplifies to `mul m p` because `add O m` is just `m`. On the right-hand side, `add (mul O p) (mul m p)` simplifies to `add O (mul m p)`, which is again `mul m p` since adding zero to any number does not change its value.\n\nTherefore, the base case is straightforward and can be proven directly. For the inductive step, we will assume the theorem holds for some `n` and then prove it for `S n`. This involves using the recursive definitions of `mul` and `add`, and leveraging the associativity of addition to align the terms correctly.\n\nIn summary, the next proving operation should be to explicitly handle the base case where `n` is `O` and then proceed to set up the inductive hypothesis for the inductive step.\n",

Clearly rewrite the problematic goal in terms of the induction hypothesis correctly: \n   - We need to manipulate the terms so that we can apply IH without any undefined variables or incorrect assumptions.\n\nSo, let's manage the goal in the current step explicitly:\n\n- Start by simplifying `mul (add (S k) m) p`, which should expand via the definition of `mul` to `add m (mul k p)` after the appropriate tooling around the definition of `add`.\n- From that point, we should use the induction hypothesis to replace parts of the goal based on what we have assumed to be true for `k`.\n\nThe crucial next step for the acting agent is: \n\n1. Apply `simpl` to `mul (add (S k) m) p`.\n2. Next, apply the induction hypothesis, ensuring we rewrite based on the previously established equivalence correctly.\n3. As necessary, revise the current goal to align with the pattern introduced by IH.\n\nBy maintaining careful attention to the rewrites and organization of operations according to established definitions and theorems, we should progress towards a successful proof.\n\nThus, the acting agent should follow these instructions carefully to avoid past pitfalls involving mismanaged variables and terms:\n\n- Simplify the goal.\n- Apply and rewrite using IH where appropriate.\n\nThis strategy will help solidify the arguments in favor of the desired statement for `mul_add_distr_r`.\n",

Missing the definition leads to confusion when trying to manipulate the goal, rendering the proof ineffective.\n\n2. **Evaluate Past Actions**: \n   The actions taken\u2014including simplifications and rewrites\u2014did not align with a proper structure since the IH wasn't defined or appropriately used. This suggests a misalignment between the proof steps and the necessary logical foundations, leading to compiler errors in Coq.\n\n3. **Propose Specific Improvements**: \n   For future actions, the agent should explicitly state the induction hypothesis at the beginning of the induction step. It should also ensure that it writes the IH with proper contextual definitions before attempting to rewrite goals. Changing the order of operations for simplifications might also improve clarity.\n\n4. **Align With Overall Goals**: \n   The ultimate goal is to reach a rigorous and compelling proof for `mul_add_distr_r`.

We should aim for full completion of the theorem, ensuring every step is justified.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n- Clearly define and state the induction hypothesis at the beginning of the inductive proof.\n- Familiarize the logic for manipulating terms based on their definitions before applying the IH.\n- Utilize clear stepwise transformations to avoid mismanagement of variables or misapplication of terms.\n- Regularly reflect to ensure all actions align with the ultimate goal of achieving a rigorous proof without admission of incomplete segments.",

                "planning_context": "\nThe current Coq problem requires us to prove the theorem `iter_S` involving the `Nat.iter` function from the `PeanoNat` library. \n\nThe theorem to be proven (`iter_S`) states that for any type `A`, natural number `n`, function `f` of type `A -> A`, and an element `x` of type `A`, the result of applying `f` to `x` and then iterating `f` over the result `n` times is equal to iterating `f` over `x` for `S n` times (`S` refers to the successor function in Peano arithmetic). Symbolically, it can be represented as:\n`Nat.iter n f (f x) = Nat.iter (S n) f x`\n\nTo prove this theorem in Coq, we need to outline the following steps:\n1. **Understanding the `Nat.iter` Function**: First, we need to ensure we understand how `Nat.iter` operates. `Nat.iter` recursively applies a function `f` a specified number of times to an argument. The recursive definition typically looks like:\n  - `Nat.iter 0 f x = x`\n  - `Nat.iter (S n) f x = f (Nat.iter n f x)`\n\n2. **Expanding both sides**: Begin by expanding the `Nat.iter` on the left-hand side of the equation in the theorem for `n` and `f x`, and also expand the right-hand side for `S n` and `x`.\n   \n   - Expanding the left side, we get:\n     `Nat.iter n f (f x)` which, by using the recursive definition of `Nat.iter`, eventually simplifies to `f (Nat.iter n f x)`.\n   - Expanding the right side, it transforms into:\n     `Nat.iter (S n) f x = f (Nat.iter n f x)`\n   These equals give an intuition that the two sides have structural similarity, which will be useful in forming our proof.\n\n3. **Induction on `n`**: \n   - **Base case (n = 0)**: Show that `Nat.iter 0 f (f x) = f x` and `Nat.iter 1 f x = f x` are clearly equal by the definition of `Nat.iter`.\n   - **Inductive step**: Assume the theorem holds for `n` (i.e., `Nat.iter n f (f x) = Nat.iter (S n) f x`), then prove it for `S n`. Use the inductive hypothesis and the recursive definition of `Nat.iter` to show that iterating `f` one more time preserves equality.\n\n4. **Simplifying and Concluding the Proof**: Finally, simplify the equation using the expanded forms, the definitions involved, and the induction hypothesis to conclude the proof of equality.\n\nRemember to include proper introspection, simplification, and rewriting techniques as required in Coq throughout the proof process. This structured approach will effectively utilize the theoretical foundation and available lemmas to arrive at a proof.\n",

This approach will allow us to address both the base case where \u2018n = 0\u2019, and the inductive step where the assumption for 'n' is utilized to establish the result for 'S n'.\nIn the base case, the application of \u2018f\u2019 directly to 'x' and then using the definition of `Nat.iter` should show that both sides of the equation are indeed equal, simply evaluating both sides to 'f x'.\nFor the inductive step, assuming the statement holds for some 'n', i.e., `Nat.iter n f (f x) = Nat.iter (S n) f x`, we need to prove that the statement remains true for 'S n'. We can use the recursive expansion of `Nat.iter` here to show how the application of 'f' one more time continues to preserve the equality across `Nat.iter n f (f x)` and `Nat.iter (S (S n)) f x`.\nThis structured usage of induction and careful handling of function application and recursion as laid out in the problem planning will lead us to a successful proof.\n",

This indicates that the agent needs to define and properly utilize the inductive hypothesis before performing operations that depend on it.\n\nSince we're proving by induction, we should specify an inductive hypothesis explicitly at the start of the proof process. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to start with the inductive case, where we assume that the theorem holds for `n` (i.e., we will assume `Nat.iter n f (f x) = Nat.iter (S n) f x` holds for our induction).\n   \n2. Therefore, we should introduce the inductive hypothesis which is typically done after establishing the base case and before moving onward to the inductive step. \n\n3. We could first identify the base case (`n = 0`) and reason through it. After confirming that the base case holds, we need to proceed to assume the inductive hypothesis and then show its application for `n`, facilitating our proof for `S n`.\n\n4. Following this structure, we can simplify the goal using the definitions of `Nat.iter` and then rewrite our expressions with the correct usage of the inductive hypothesis.\n\nBased on the reflection about the previous actions, the next operation for the acting agent should focus on correctly establishing and signaling the inductive hypothesis before continuing with proving. The agent could use the following commands in Coq:\n\n1. Introduce `n` and `IHn` by using `induction n as [| n IHn].` \n2. Prove the base case for `n = 0`.\n3. Proceed to the inductive step with `simpl.` then rewrite with `IHn` correctly applied.\n\nThus, the upcoming command might look like:\n\n",

The failure to properly align the structure of `Nat.iter` within the proof caused this issue. Particularly, the rewrite step using `IHn` did not translate to the goal adequately, indicating that there might have been an oversight in the context of how `Nat.iter` functions were being manipulated and rewritten.\n\n### Evaluation of Past Actions\n1. The first step, correctly breaking down the proof by induction, was effective; however, the subsequent handling of the goals left room for improvement, particularly concerning how terms align when applying the inductive hypothesis.\n2. There was an incorrect assumption about the equivalence of terms when performing the rewrite. This indicates that a more careful approach is needed to confirm the alignment of function evaluations and their corresponding arguments.\n\n### Proposed Improvements\n1. When reaching the inductive step, thoroughly check what we have and how `Nat.iter` operates with its arguments after `simpl.` is applied. Recognize that directly applying `IHn` may need additional reasons or adjustments to the expressions.\n2. Before using `rewrite IHn`, consider performing further simplifications or transformations on both sides to ensure that they match as expected, exploring nested function applications explicitly.\n3. In cases where `IHn` does not yield the desired result, evaluate the structure of the goal \u2014 specifically whether you can extract simpler components before applying the inductive hypothesis.\n\n### Future Alignment with Overall Goal\nTo successfully prove the theorem `iter_S`, better aligning future actions will include confirming the precise formulations of functions and their interactions within the inductive proof. This approach will enhance the subsequent reasoning steps and ensure that rewriting occurs in contexts that match the goal structure accurately. By rectifying our understanding of `Nat.iter` during the proof, we can create a clearer path to a completed proof that adheres to the goal of successfully validating the theorem without invoking 'Admitted' or leading to incomplete reasoning steps in Coq.",
