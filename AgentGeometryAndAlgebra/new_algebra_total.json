        "solution": "First, we observe the symmetric nature of the equations which resemble the elementary symmetric polynomials. We can express $x^2+y^2+z^2$ using the identity $x^2+y^2+z^2=(x+y+z)^2-2(xy+xz+yz)$. Substituting the given values, we get $x^2+y^2+z^2=12^2-2\\cdot47=144-94=50$. To find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we solve the cubic equation formed by the given symmetric equations: $t^3 - (x+y+z)t^2 + (xy+xz+yz)t - xyz = 0$ or $t^3 - 12t^2 + 47t - 60 = 0$. Factoring or using the Rational Root Theorem, we find $t=4, 3, 5$. Thus, $x=3, y=4, z=5$ and the answer is $\\boxed{(3,4,5)}$.",

From the first ratio, s = 3/2 * m. From the second ratio, m = 5/3 * l. Substitute the value of s in terms of m into the total equation: 3/2 * m + m + l = 62, m = 5/3 * l. Substitute for m from the second ratio: 3/2 * (5/3 * l) + 5/3 * l + l = 62, solving gives l = 12, m = 20, s = 30. The total number of students is 30*20 + 20*30 + 12*50 = 600 + 600 + 600 = \\boxed{1800} students.",
