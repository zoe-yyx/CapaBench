    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem structure:\n   - Understand the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Identify the assumption and the goal in the lemma Leaf_Node_conflict\n\n2. Recognize the contradiction:\n   - The assumption equates two different constructors of the 'tree' datatype\n   - This is inherently impossible due to the nature of algebraic datatypes\n\n3. Prove by contradiction:\n   - Start with the assumption \"Leaf = Node l v r\"\n   - Show that this leads to a logical inconsistency\n   - Use this inconsistency to prove any statement, including \"1 = 2\"\n\n4. Utilize datatype properties:\n   - Recall that constructors of a datatype are always distinct\n   - This fact is automatically known to Isabelle for user-defined datatypes\n\n5. Apply proof techniques:\n   - Consider using 'cases' on the assumption to expose the contradiction\n   - Alternatively, look for built-in tactics that can automatically handle such contradictions\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Once the contradiction is exposed, the proof should be straightforward\n   - Isabelle should be able to automatically derive \"1 = 2\" from the contradiction\n\n7. Reflect on the meaning:\n   - Understand that this lemma demonstrates that from a false assumption, any conclusion can be derived\n   - This is known as the principle of explosion or \"ex falso quodlibet\"\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe previous attempt was logically correct but encountered a syntax error due to the use of a Unicode symbol. We should maintain the same logical approach but adjust the syntax to be compatible with Isabelle. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Replace the Unicode \"â‰ \" symbol with the ASCII equivalent \"~=\" in the 'have' statement.\n\n2. Keep the overall structure of the proof, as it correctly identifies the contradiction between the assumption and the inherent properties of the tree datatype.\n\n3. Use the 'simp' method to automatically prove that Leaf is not equal to Node l v r, as this is a basic property of distinct constructors in datatypes.\n\n4. Continue to use the 'contradiction' method to derive the conclusion from the contradiction between the assumption and the fact established by 'simp'.\n\n5. If the 'contradiction' method doesn't automatically complete the proof, we may need to explicitly state why the contradiction leads to our desired conclusion \"1 = 2\".\n\nThis approach should allow Isabelle to process the proof without syntax errors and leverage its built-in knowledge about datatype properties to complete the proof efficiently.\n",
