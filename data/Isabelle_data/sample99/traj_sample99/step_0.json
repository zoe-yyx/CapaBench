    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and there are no historical actions or current observations, we should start by following the planned proof strategy. The first step is to begin the proof and use the assumption provided in the theorem.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to start the proof by stating the goal and the given assumption.\n2. The assumption \"Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2\" is crucial for our proof, as it establishes the equality of two Node constructions.\n3. The next logical step would be to apply the injectivity property of the Node constructor. This property states that if two Node constructions are equal, their corresponding components must also be equal.\n4. By applying this injectivity property, we should be able to derive three separate equalities: one for the left subtrees (l1 = l2), one for the values (v1 = v2), and most importantly for our goal, one for the right subtrees (r1 = r2).\n5. Once we have these equalities, we can focus on the equality r1 = r2, which is exactly what we need to prove.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I suggest that the acting agent should:\n1. Begin the proof.\n2. State the assumption.\n3. Apply the injectivity property of the Node constructor.\n4. Extract the equality r1 = r2.\n5. Use this equality to conclude the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should be prepared to use tactics such as 'simp' or 'auto' if needed to simplify expressions, and potentially the 'rule' tactic to apply the injectivity property of the Node constructor.\n",
