    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_succ_r:\n\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - We need to prove this for all natural numbers n and m\n   - The myadd function is defined recursively\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Induction on n is likely the best approach, as myadd is defined recursively on its first argument\n\n3. Set Up Induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove Base Case:\n   - Show: myadd MyZero (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd MyZero m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n5. Prove Inductive Step:\n   - Induction hypothesis: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - Show: myadd (MySuc n) (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd (MySuc n) m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MySuc\n\n6. Use Simplification:\n   - Apply the definition of myadd in each step\n   - Utilize the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Ensure both cases (base and inductive step) are proven\n   - Verify that the proof covers all possible values of n\n\n8. Review and Refine:\n   - Check for any gaps in the reasoning\n   - Ensure all steps are properly justified\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_succ_r theorem, focusing on induction as the primary method and leveraging the recursive definition of myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is due to a syntax issue in the function definition, not a logical problem in the proof itself. To proceed with the proof, we need to correct the syntax error first. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   - Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"⇒\" (U+21D2) in the type definition of 'myadd'.\n   - The corrected line should look like this:\n     fun myadd :: \"mynat ⇒ mynat ⇒ mynat\" where\n\n2. Verification:\n   - After making this correction, we should attempt to run the entire proof again.\n   - The existing proof structure appears to be logically sound, so no changes to the proof steps themselves should be necessary at this point.\n\n3. Next Steps:\n   - If the syntax correction resolves the error, the proof should proceed without issues.\n   - We should then focus on verifying that each step of the proof is correct and that the induction is properly applied.\n   - Pay special attention to the base case and the inductive step to ensure they are correctly formulated and proven.\n\n4. Potential Issues:\n   - If any further errors occur after fixing the syntax, we should carefully examine the error messages and the specific lines they refer to.\n   - We may need to adjust the proof tactics or the way we apply simplification rules if Isabelle encounters any difficulties in automatically proving certain steps.\n\nBy addressing this syntactical issue first, we can then proceed with verifying the correctness of the proof logic and structure.\n",
