    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_succ_r:\n\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - We need to prove this for all natural numbers n and m\n   - The myadd function is defined recursively\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Induction on n is likely the best approach, as myadd is defined recursively on its first argument\n\n3. Set Up Induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove Base Case:\n   - Show: myadd MyZero (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd MyZero m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n5. Prove Inductive Step:\n   - Induction hypothesis: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - Show: myadd (MySuc n) (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd (MySuc n) m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MySuc\n\n6. Use Simplification:\n   - Apply the definition of myadd in each step\n   - Utilize the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Ensure both cases (base and inductive step) are proven\n   - Verify that the proof covers all possible values of n\n\n8. Review and Refine:\n   - Check for any gaps in the reasoning\n   - Ensure all steps are properly justified\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_succ_r theorem, focusing on induction as the primary method and leveraging the recursive definition of myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and the planning strategy, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. Start with setting up the proof structure:\n   The theorem involves a property for all natural numbers n and m, and the myadd function is defined recursively on its first argument. This suggests that induction on n would be an effective approach.\n\n2. Begin the proof:\n   We should start by applying induction on n. This will set up two cases: the base case (n = MyZero) and the inductive step (n = MySuc n').\n\n3. For the base case (n = MyZero):\n   We need to show that: myadd MyZero (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd MyZero m)\n   This should be straightforward using the definition of myadd for MyZero.\n\n4. For the inductive step:\n   We assume the statement holds for some arbitrary n', and we need to prove it for MySuc n'.\n   That is, assuming: myadd n' (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n' m)\n   We need to show: myadd (MySuc n') (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd (MySuc n') m)\n\n5. In both cases, we'll likely need to use the definitions of myadd and apply simplification rules.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, it appears there was a technical issue with the Isabelle environment rather than a problem with the proof itself. However, we can still reflect on the proof structure and suggest improvements:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the use of 'sorry' prevents the proof from being completed rigorously.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'sorry' placeholders with actual proof steps for both the base case and inductive step, using the definitions of myadd and applying simplification rules.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. For the base case (MyZero):\n   - We should explicitly use the definition of myadd for MyZero.\n   - Then, simplify the resulting expression to show it matches the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n2. For the inductive step (MySuc n'):\n   - We should use the definition of myadd for MySuc.\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis.\n   - Use simplification rules to show the resulting expression matches the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n3. Overall, we should aim to complete each step of the proof without using 'sorry', ensuring a rigorous and complete proof.\n\n4. If any technical issues persist with the Isabelle environment, we should address those before proceeding with the proof, as they may prevent proper verification of our steps.\n\nThese improvements will help guide the next reasoning and action steps towards a complete and correct proof of the target theorem.",
