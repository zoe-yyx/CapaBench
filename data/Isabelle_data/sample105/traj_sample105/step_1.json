    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_succ_r:\n\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - We need to prove this for all natural numbers n and m\n   - The myadd function is defined recursively\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Induction on n is likely the best approach, as myadd is defined recursively on its first argument\n\n3. Set Up Induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove Base Case:\n   - Show: myadd MyZero (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd MyZero m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n5. Prove Inductive Step:\n   - Induction hypothesis: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - Show: myadd (MySuc n) (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd (MySuc n) m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MySuc\n\n6. Use Simplification:\n   - Apply the definition of myadd in each step\n   - Utilize the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Ensure both cases (base and inductive step) are proven\n   - Verify that the proof covers all possible values of n\n\n8. Review and Refine:\n   - Check for any gaps in the reasoning\n   - Ensure all steps are properly justified\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_succ_r theorem, focusing on induction as the primary method and leveraging the recursive definition of myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the base case (MyZero):\n1. We need to prove: myadd MyZero (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd MyZero m)\n2. Use the definition of myadd for MyZero: myadd MyZero m = m\n3. Apply this definition to both sides of the equation:\n   Left side: myadd MyZero (MySuc m) = MySuc m\n   Right side: MySuc (myadd MyZero m) = MySuc m\n4. Both sides are equal, so the base case holds\n\nFor the inductive step (MySuc n'):\n1. We need to prove: myadd (MySuc n') (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd (MySuc n') m)\n2. Use the definition of myadd for MySuc: myadd (MySuc n') m = MySuc (myadd n' m)\n3. Apply this to the left side: \n   myadd (MySuc n') (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n' (MySuc m))\n4. Use the induction hypothesis: myadd n' (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n' m)\n5. Substitute this into the left side:\n   MySuc (myadd n' (MySuc m)) = MySuc (MySuc (myadd n' m))\n6. For the right side:\n   MySuc (myadd (MySuc n') m) = MySuc (MySuc (myadd n' m))\n7. Both sides are equal, so the inductive step holds\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps, replacing the 'sorry' placeholders with actual proof commands. Use 'simp' or 'auto' where appropriate to handle simplification steps.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was correct, but the execution failed due to technical issues with the Isabelle environment or system resources.\n\nImprovement: We need to ensure the Isabelle environment is properly set up and has sufficient resources, then rerun the proof without changing the logical structure.\n```\n\nThis reflection is based on the following observations:\n\n1. The proof structure and steps outlined in the current thought process are logically sound and follow the correct approach for proving the lemma add_succ_r.\n\n2. The past actions show that the proof was correctly implemented in Isabelle syntax, following the structure outlined in the thought process.\n\n3. However, the current observation indicates that the Isabelle session failed to start due to a system-level error, rather than a problem with the proof itself.\n\nThe error message suggests issues with the Isabelle environment setup or system resources:\n- \"Session startup failed\"\n- \"standard_output terminated\"\n- \"Killed: 9\"\n- \"Return code: 127 (COMMAND NOT FOUND)\"\n\nThese errors point to problems with the execution environment rather than the logical structure of the proof. Therefore, the next steps should focus on resolving these technical issues:\n\n1. Ensure Isabelle is correctly installed and configured.\n2. Check if there are sufficient system resources (memory, CPU) available.\n3. Verify that all required dependencies are present.\n4. If possible, try running the proof on a different machine or in a different environment to isolate the issue.\n\nOnce the environment issues are resolved, the same proof structure should be attempted again, as it appears to be correct and complete.",
