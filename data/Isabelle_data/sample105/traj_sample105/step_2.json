    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_succ_r:\n\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - We need to prove this for all natural numbers n and m\n   - The myadd function is defined recursively\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Induction on n is likely the best approach, as myadd is defined recursively on its first argument\n\n3. Set Up Induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove Base Case:\n   - Show: myadd MyZero (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd MyZero m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n5. Prove Inductive Step:\n   - Induction hypothesis: myadd n (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd n m)\n   - Show: myadd (MySuc n) (MySuc m) = MySuc (myadd (MySuc n) m)\n   - Use the definition of myadd for MySuc\n\n6. Use Simplification:\n   - Apply the definition of myadd in each step\n   - Utilize the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Ensure both cases (base and inductive step) are proven\n   - Verify that the proof covers all possible values of n\n\n8. Review and Refine:\n   - Check for any gaps in the reasoning\n   - Ensure all steps are properly justified\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_succ_r theorem, focusing on induction as the primary method and leveraging the recursive definition of myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and reflection, it's clear that the issue lies not with the proof itself, but with the Isabelle environment. The proof structure and implementation appear to be correct, but we're unable to verify this due to technical difficulties. Therefore, our reasoning should focus on addressing these technical issues while maintaining confidence in the existing proof structure.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. Environment Verification:\n   - Before proceeding with any changes to the proof, we need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and functional.\n   - This includes checking the installation, verifying system resources, and ensuring all dependencies are met.\n\n2. Proof Preservation:\n   - The existing proof structure should be maintained as it follows the correct logical steps for proving the lemma add_succ_r.\n   - The induction approach, base case, and inductive step are all correctly formulated.\n\n3. Systematic Retrying:\n   - Once the environment issues are resolved, the entire proof should be rerun without modifications.\n   - This will allow us to verify if the proof is indeed correct and complete.\n\n4. Error Analysis:\n   - If the proof fails after environment issues are resolved, we should carefully analyze any error messages or unexpected behaviors.\n   - This analysis will guide us in making any necessary adjustments to the proof structure or implementation.\n\n5. Incremental Verification:\n   - If issues persist, consider breaking down the proof into smaller parts and verifying each part individually.\n   - This could help isolate any potential logical or syntactical errors that may have been overlooked.\n\n6. Documentation:\n   - Keep a record of any environment issues encountered and their resolutions.\n   - This documentation can be valuable for future proofs and troubleshooting.\n\nIn summary, our next steps should focus on resolving the technical environment issues while maintaining the integrity of the existing proof. Once a stable environment is established, we can proceed with verifying and, if necessary, refining the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails due to a lexical error in the type definition of the 'myadd' function, specifically with the arrow symbol used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"⇒\" (U+21D2) in the type definition of 'myadd' to resolve the lexical error and allow the proof to proceed.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue is not with the proof logic or structure, but with a syntax error in the function definition. The non-standard arrow symbol is causing Isabelle to fail in parsing the type definition.\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. Syntax Correction: The immediate action should be to correct the arrow symbol in the 'myadd' function definition. This is likely a character encoding issue, where a visually similar but incorrect Unicode character was used instead of the proper Isabelle arrow.\n\n2. Environment Check: After correcting the syntax, it's important to verify that the Isabelle environment can properly display and process Unicode characters. This might involve checking the text editor settings or the Isabelle interface configuration.\n\n3. Consistent Symbol Usage: Moving forward, ensure that all special symbols used in the proof (such as logical connectives and type arrows) are the correct Isabelle-specific Unicode characters.\n\n4. Proof Verification: Once the syntax is corrected, the entire proof should be re-run to confirm that it proceeds without errors. The existing proof structure appears sound, so no changes to the logical steps should be necessary.\n\n5. Error Checking Process: Implement a more rigorous error-checking process when inputting proofs, perhaps using a tool or method to verify the correctness of special characters before attempting to run the proof.\n\nBy addressing this syntactical issue, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and proceed with verifying the correctness of the proof logic itself.",
