Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication (A → B)\n   - A is a conjunction of two bi-implications: (P1 ↔ P2) ∧ (Q1 ↔ Q2)\n   - B is a bi-implication of two implications: (P1 → Q1) ↔ (P2 → Q2)\n\n2. Plan the proof strategy:\n   a. Use the implication introduction rule (impI) to assume the left-hand side of the main implication.\n   b. Prove the bi-implication in the conclusion using the iff introduction rule (iffI).\n   c. For each direction of the iff, use implication introduction and elimination rules.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Apply 'rule impI' to introduce the assumption.\n   b. Apply 'rule iffI' to split the conclusion into two implications.\n   c. For the forward direction (→):\n      - Assume P2\n      - Use the assumption to show P1\n      - Use the implication P1 → Q1 to derive Q1\n      - Use the assumption again to show Q2\n   d. For the backward direction (←):\n      - Follow a similar process, but start with assuming P1\n\n4. Utilize simplification and classical reasoning:\n   - Use 'simp' or 'auto' tactics where appropriate to simplify logical expressions.\n   - Apply 'blast' or 'metis' for more complex logical reasoning steps.\n\n5. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are closed.\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof.\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Managing multiple assumptions and implications.\n   - Correctly applying bi-implication properties.\n\n7. Tips:\n   - Use 'apply' style for complex steps and 'by' for simpler ones.\n   - Leverage the assumptions effectively in each direction of the proof.\n   - Pay attention to the logical structure and use appropriate introduction and elimination rules.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by following the planned strategy. The first step in our plan is to use the implication introduction rule (impI) to assume the left-hand side of the main implication.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem is structured as A → B, where A is (P1 ↔ P2) ∧ (Q1 ↔ Q2) and B is (P1 → Q1) ↔ (P2 → Q2).\n2. Using the implication introduction rule will allow us to assume A and then prove B under this assumption.\n3. This step will set up the proof structure and make the assumption available for later use.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to apply the implication introduction rule. This can be done using the 'rule impI' command in Isabelle.\n",
