    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - Left side: ∀a. (P a ∧ Q a)\n   - Right side: (∀a. P a) ∧ (∀a. Q a)\n   - Goal: Prove these are equivalent\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the method of proving both directions of the equality\n   - Split the proof into two parts: left-to-right and right-to-left\n\n3. Left-to-right direction (⇒):\n   - Assume the left side: ∀a. (P a ∧ Q a)\n   - Show this implies both conjuncts on the right side:\n     a) Prove ∀a. P a\n     b) Prove ∀a. Q a\n\n4. Right-to-left direction (⇐):\n   - Assume the right side: (∀a. P a) ∧ (∀a. Q a)\n   - Show this implies ∀a. (P a ∧ Q a)\n\n5. Proof techniques to consider:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for each step\n   - Utilize 'rule' tactic for universal quantification\n   - Apply 'auto' or 'simp' for simplification where appropriate\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are discharged\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling the universal quantifier correctly\n   - Properly breaking down and reconstructing the conjunctions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof strategy is fundamentally correct, but we need to refine our tactic application to be more precise and effective. Let's adjust our approach as follows:\n\n1. Start with 'apply (rule iffI)' to split the equality into two implications.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction:\n   - Use 'apply (auto)' to simplify the goal.\n   - Apply 'rule allI' to introduce the universal quantifier.\n   - Use 'rule conjI' to split the conjunction.\n   - For each part of the conjunction:\n     * Apply 'drule_tac x=a in spec' to specialize the universal quantifier.\n     * Use 'erule conjE' to eliminate the conjunction.\n     * Finish with 'simp' or 'assumption' as appropriate.\n\n3. For the right-to-left direction:\n   - Again, start with 'apply (auto)' to simplify.\n   - Use 'rule allI' to introduce the universal quantifier.\n   - Apply 'erule conjE' twice to break down the conjunction in the assumption.\n   - Use 'drule_tac x=a in spec' for each universal quantifier.\n   - Finish with 'simp' or 'auto' to complete the proof.\n\n4. If any step fails, consider using 'metis' or 'blast' for that specific subgoal.\n\nThis refined approach should provide a more robust and precise proof structure, addressing the issues encountered in the previous attempt.\n",
