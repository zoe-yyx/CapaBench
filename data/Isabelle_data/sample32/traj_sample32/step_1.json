Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the method of proving both directions of the equality\n   - Split the proof into two parts: left-to-right and right-to-left\n\n3. Left-to-right direction (⇒):\n   - Assume the left side: ∀a. (P a ∧ Q a)\n   - Show this implies both conjuncts on the right side:\n     a) Prove ∀a. P a\n     b) Prove ∀a. Q a\n\n4. Right-to-left direction (⇐):\n   - Assume the right side: (∀a. P a) ∧ (∀a. Q a)\n   - Show this implies ∀a. (P a ∧ Q a)\n\n5. Proof techniques to consider:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for each step\n   - Utilize 'rule' tactic for universal quantification\n   - Apply 'auto' or 'simp' for simplification where appropriate\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are discharged\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nTo correctly approach this proof, we need to split the equality into two implications and then handle each direction separately. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start by applying the 'iffI' rule to split the equality into two implications:\n   apply (rule iffI)\n\n   This will generate two subgoals, one for each direction of the implication.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction (⇒):\n   - We need to assume the left side and prove the right side.\n   - Use 'allI' to handle the universal quantifier on the left side.\n   - Use 'conjI' to split the right side into two conjuncts.\n   - For each conjunct, use 'allI' again to introduce the universal quantifier.\n   - Use 'conjE' to extract the relevant part from the assumption.\n\n3. For the right-to-left direction (⇐):\n   - We assume the right side and prove the left side.\n   - Use 'allI' to introduce the universal quantifier on the left side.\n   - Use 'conjI' to prove the conjunction under the quantifier.\n   - Use 'spec' to instantiate the universal quantifiers from the assumptions.\n\n4. After setting up these proof steps, we can use 'assumption' or 'simp' to complete simpler steps.\n\n5. If any goals remain, we can try using 'auto' to finish the proof.\n\nBy following this structured approach, we should be able to prove the theorem without encountering undefined fact errors and make significant progress in the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof process seems correct, but there's an issue with the SQLite database causing a constraint failure, which is unrelated to the actual proof.\n\nImprovement: The proof steps appear to be correct and complete, so we should focus on resolving the SQLite database issue, possibly by clearing the database or ensuring unique session names.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that the issue is not with the proof itself, but with the system's database management. Here are some additional points to consider:\n\n1. The proof structure and steps appear to be correct and follow the planned approach.\n\n2. The error message suggests a problem with the SQLite database, specifically a primary key constraint violation in the isabelle_session_info table.\n\n3. This error is likely caused by an attempt to insert a duplicate session name into the database, which is not allowed due to the unique constraint on the primary key.\n\n4. To resolve this, we might need to:\n   - Clear the existing database entries for this session.\n   - Ensure that each new proof session has a unique name.\n   - Check if there are any issues with the Isabelle configuration or environment setup.\n\n5. Since the proof itself seems correct, once the database issue is resolved, the proof should be accepted without changes.\n\nFor the next steps, we should:\n\n1. Attempt to run the proof again after clearing any existing session data.\n2. If the error persists, try renaming the theory or creating a new theory file with a different name.\n3. Check the Isabelle installation and configuration for any issues that might be causing database problems.\n4. If the database issue is resolved and the proof is accepted, we can consider this theorem successfully proven.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the proof logic is sound, and our focus should be on resolving the technical database issue rather than modifying the proof itself.",
