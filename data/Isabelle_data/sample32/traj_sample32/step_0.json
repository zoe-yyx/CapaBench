    "reasoning": "\n1. We are at the beginning of the proof, so we need to start by applying the basic proof structure for an equality theorem.\n\n2. The theorem statement is an equality, which suggests we should prove both directions. This aligns with the planning strategy.\n\n3. We should begin with the apply command to start the proof and use the 'iff' tactic to split the equality into two implications.\n\n4. After splitting, we'll have two subgoals to prove:\n   a) (∀a. P a ∧ Q a) ⟹ (∀a. P a) ∧ (∀a. Q a)\n   b) (∀a. P a) ∧ (∀a. Q a) ⟹ (∀a. P a ∧ Q a)\n\n5. For each direction, we'll need to handle universal quantifiers and conjunctions properly.\n\n6. We should guide the acting agent to start with the 'apply' command followed by the 'iff' tactic to set up the proof structure.\n\n7. After this initial step, we'll be ready to tackle each direction of the proof separately in subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The use of the 'iff' rule was incorrect as it is not a built-in Isabelle rule, leading to an undefined fact error.\n\nImprovement: Instead of using 'iff', we should use the built-in 'rule' tactic with the 'iffI' rule to split the equality into two implications, followed by appropriate tactics to handle universal quantifiers and conjunctions.\n```\n\nReflecting on the current situation, we can see that the proposed approach using the 'iff' tactic was not correct for Isabelle. This error highlights the importance of using proper Isabelle syntax and built-in rules.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Use the correct Isabelle syntax for splitting an equality into two implications.\n2. Utilize built-in Isabelle rules and tactics that are known to work with universal quantifiers and conjunctions.\n3. Break down the proof into smaller, more manageable steps.\n4. Consider using the 'auto' tactic to handle some of the simpler logical manipulations automatically.\n\nFor the next steps, we should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Start the proof with 'apply (rule iffI)' to properly split the equality.\n2. For each resulting subgoal, use appropriate tactics to handle universal quantifiers (like 'allI') and conjunctions (like 'conjI').\n3. Use 'assumption' or 'simp' tactics where appropriate to complete simpler steps.\n4. If needed, use the 'auto' tactic to attempt to solve remaining goals automatically.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to make progress on the proof without encountering undefined fact errors, and move closer to successfully proving the theorem.",
