    "reasoning": "\n1. Start with a clean slate by removing all existing proof steps and begin with the theorem statement.\n\n2. Apply the 'rule iffI' tactic to split the proof into two directions (left-to-right and right-to-left).\n\n3. For the left-to-right direction:\n   a. Use 'apply (rule allI)' to introduce a universal quantifier.\n   b. Apply 'apply (rule conjI)' to split the conjunction.\n   c. For each part of the conjunction:\n      - Use 'apply (drule spec)' to specialize the universal quantifier.\n      - Apply 'apply (erule conjE)' to eliminate the conjunction.\n      - Use 'apply assumption' to complete each part.\n\n4. For the right-to-left direction:\n   a. Use 'apply (rule allI)' to introduce a universal quantifier.\n   b. Apply 'apply (rule conjI)' to create the conjunction.\n   c. For each part:\n      - Use 'apply (drule spec)' to specialize the relevant universal quantifier.\n      - Apply 'apply assumption' to complete each part.\n\n5. After each 'apply' statement, use 'apply (auto)' or 'apply (simp)' to simplify the goal and catch any trivial implications.\n\n6. If at any point the proof gets stuck, use 'apply (metis)' or 'apply (blast)' to attempt automated proving.\n\n7. Finally, use 'done' to complete the proof.\n\nRemember to check the subgoals after each step to ensure the proof is progressing as expected. If any step fails, review the resulting subgoals and adjust the tactic accordingly.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof strategy is correct, but the application of tactics is not precise enough, leading to a failure in applying the proof method.\n\nImprovement: Refine the application of tactics by being more explicit in handling quantifiers and conjunctions, and consider using 'apply (auto)' strategically to simplify goals between major proof steps.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. The overall structure of the proof is correct, but we need to be more careful in how we apply each tactic.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction:\n   - After applying 'rule iffI', we should use 'apply (auto)' to simplify the goal.\n   - Then, use 'apply (rule allI)' followed by 'apply (rule conjI)' as planned.\n   - When using 'erule_tac', we need to be more precise. Instead of 'erule_tac x=a in allE', use 'drule_tac x=a in spec' to specialize the universal quantifier without removing it from the assumptions.\n   - After each major step, consider using 'apply (auto)' to simplify the goal and catch any trivial implications.\n\n3. For the right-to-left direction:\n   - Similar to the left-to-right direction, use 'apply (auto)' after major steps.\n   - Be more explicit in handling the conjunction in the assumption. Use 'apply (erule conjE)' before introducing the universal quantifier.\n\n4. Consider using 'by auto' instead of 'apply assumption' for simple goal completions, as it might handle more cases automatically.\n\n5. If at any point the proof gets stuck, don't hesitate to use 'apply (metis)' or 'apply (blast)' to attempt automated proving for that specific subgoal.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to complete the proof successfully without encountering application failures. The key is to be more precise in our tactic applications and to use automation strategically to simplify goals throughout the proof process.",
