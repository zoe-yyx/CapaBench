Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the standard equivalence proof method: prove both directions\n   - Direction 1: P ∨ (P ∧ Q) ⟶ P\n   - Direction 2: P ⟶ P ∨ (P ∧ Q)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with \"apply (rule iffI)\" to split into two subgoals\n   \n   b. For Direction 1 (P ∨ (P ∧ Q) ⟶ P):\n      - Use case analysis on the disjunction\n      - For P case: trivial\n      - For (P ∧ Q) case: extract P from the conjunction\n   \n   c. For Direction 2 (P ⟶ P ∨ (P ∧ Q)):\n      - Introduce P as an assumption\n      - Use disjunction introduction to prove P ∨ (P ∧ Q)\n\n4. Consider using Isabelle's automated tools:\n   - Try \"auto\" tactic after splitting the equivalence\n   - If \"auto\" doesn't solve it completely, proceed with manual steps\n\n5. Reflect on potential simplifications:\n   - The proof might be straightforward enough for Isabelle's automated reasoning\n   - Be prepared to adjust the plan if automated tools solve it entirely\n",
