    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem smul_ex1: \"smul 1 1 = 3\"\n   - The smul function is defined as smul x y = x * y + x + y\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Since this is a simple equality proof involving a defined function, we can use direct calculation\n\n3. Proof Steps:\n   a) Start with the left-hand side of the equation: smul 1 1\n   b) Expand the definition of smul using the given definition\n   c) Perform the arithmetic calculations\n   d) Show that the result equals the right-hand side (3)\n\n4. Proof Techniques to Use:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of smul\n   - simp: To simplify arithmetic expressions\n\n5. Expected Challenges:\n   - None expected for this simple problem, but be prepared to break down steps if needed\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the calculation is correct\n   - Confirm that the final result matches the right-hand side of the equation\n\n7. Potential Extensions:\n   - After proving this specific case, consider if a more general theorem about smul could be formulated\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a syntax error due to the use of Unicode arrow characters (â‡’) in the type signature of the smul function definition. This is preventing Isabelle from parsing the theory file correctly. To resolve this:\n\n1. First, we need to modify the smul function definition to use ASCII arrow characters (=>). This should resolve the lexical error.\n\n2. Once the syntax error is fixed, we can proceed with the original proof strategy, which was correct but couldn't be executed due to the parsing error.\n\n3. The proof steps should remain the same:\n   a) Unfold the definition of smul using 'unfolding smul_def'\n   b) Use the simplifier to perform the arithmetic calculations with 'by simp'\n\n4. After making these changes, we expect Isabelle to successfully parse the theory file and execute the proof.\n\n5. If the proof is successful, we will have verified the lemma smul_ex1: \"smul 1 1 = 3\".\n\n6. In case any further issues arise after fixing the syntax, we should carefully review each step of the proof to ensure it's logically sound and syntactically correct.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on correcting the syntax in the function definition and then reapplying the original proof script. This should be sufficient to complete the proof of smul_ex1.\n",
