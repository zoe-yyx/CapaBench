    "planning_context": "\nProving Plan for theorem \"reverse_height\":\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a custom datatype 'tree' with two constructors: Leaf and Node.\n   - Two functions are defined: tree_reverse and tree_height.\n   - We need to prove that the height of a reversed tree is equal to the height of the original tree.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use structural induction on the tree datatype.\n   - Base case: Leaf\n   - Inductive case: Node\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   a. Start with induction on 't':\n      - case Leaf\n      - case Node l v r\n\n   b. For the Leaf case:\n      - Show that tree_height (tree_reverse Leaf) = tree_height Leaf\n\n   c. For the Node case:\n      - Assume the induction hypothesis for l and r\n      - Show that tree_height (tree_reverse (Node l v r)) = tree_height (Node l v r)\n\n   d. In the Node case, expand the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_height\n\n   e. Use the induction hypotheses and properties of max function to complete the proof\n\n4. Key steps:\n   - Apply induction on 't'\n   - Use simp to simplify expressions where possible\n   - Use the induction hypotheses in the Node case\n   - Possibly need to use properties of max function (commutativity, associativity)\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling the max function in the height calculation\n   - Correctly applying the induction hypotheses\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Confirm that the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof for the theorem \"reverse_height\", our first step should be to apply structural induction on the tree datatype. This aligns with the planned approach and will set up the foundation for our proof.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem is about a property that holds for all trees, which makes structural induction an appropriate method.\n2. The tree datatype has two constructors (Leaf and Node), so we'll have two cases to prove.\n3. Induction will allow us to prove the base case (Leaf) and then use the induction hypothesis in the recursive case (Node).\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by applying induction on the variable 't' in the theorem statement. This will set up the proof structure for both the base case and the inductive case, allowing us to tackle each part of the proof systematically.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The use of Unicode arrow (⇒) in type declarations caused a lexical error in Isabelle.\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) in all type declarations to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights the key issue that led to the parsing error in Isabelle. The use of the Unicode arrow (⇒) in type declarations is not compatible with Isabelle's parser, causing a lexical error. \n\nTo improve our approach, we need to adjust our notation to use the ASCII equivalent (=>) instead. This change should be applied consistently throughout the theory file, including in the definitions of `tree_reverse` and `tree_height` functions.\n\nAdditionally, while not directly related to the current error, it's worth noting that the proof structure looks correct, but the inductive case (Node) uses 'sorry' to complete the proof. In future steps, we should focus on providing a complete proof for this case without relying on 'sorry'.\n\nFor the next round, the acting agent should:\n1. Replace all instances of ⇒ with => in type declarations.\n2. Re-run the proof attempt with these changes.\n3. If successful, focus on completing the proof for the Node case without using 'sorry'.\n\nThese actions will address the immediate syntax issue and set us up to complete the proof rigorously in subsequent steps.",
