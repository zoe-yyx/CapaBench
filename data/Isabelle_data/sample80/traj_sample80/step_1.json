    "planning_context": "\nProving Plan for theorem \"reverse_height\":\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a custom datatype 'tree' with two constructors: Leaf and Node.\n   - Two functions are defined: tree_reverse and tree_height.\n   - We need to prove that the height of a reversed tree is equal to the height of the original tree.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use structural induction on the tree datatype.\n   - Base case: Leaf\n   - Inductive case: Node\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   a. Start with induction on 't':\n      - case Leaf\n      - case Node l v r\n\n   b. For the Leaf case:\n      - Show that tree_height (tree_reverse Leaf) = tree_height Leaf\n\n   c. For the Node case:\n      - Assume the induction hypothesis for l and r\n      - Show that tree_height (tree_reverse (Node l v r)) = tree_height (Node l v r)\n\n   d. In the Node case, expand the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_height\n\n   e. Use the induction hypotheses and properties of max function to complete the proof\n\n4. Key steps:\n   - Apply induction on 't'\n   - Use simp to simplify expressions where possible\n   - Use the induction hypotheses in the Node case\n   - Possibly need to use properties of max function (commutativity, associativity)\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling the max function in the height calculation\n   - Correctly applying the induction hypotheses\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Confirm that the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The primary issue is the use of Unicode arrow (⇒) in type declarations, which is causing a lexical error. We need to replace all instances of ⇒ with => in the theory file. This includes the type declarations for both tree_reverse and tree_height functions.\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   The overall proof structure using induction on 't' is correct. The base case (Leaf) has been handled correctly using simp. We should maintain this structure.\n\n3. Inductive Case (Node):\n   After fixing the syntax error, we should focus on completing the proof for the Node case. The current 'sorry' should be replaced with a proper proof.\n\n4. Proof Strategy for Node Case:\n   a. Expand the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_height for the Node case.\n   b. Use the induction hypotheses for the left (l) and right (r) subtrees.\n   c. Manipulate the max function expressions to show equality.\n\n5. Simplification:\n   Use simp or auto tactics where possible to simplify expressions, especially after expanding definitions.\n\n6. Max Function Properties:\n   Be prepared to use properties of the max function, such as commutativity (max a b = max b a) and associativity, if needed in the Node case.\n\n7. Step-by-Step Approach:\n   If the proof doesn't immediately go through after syntax correction, consider breaking down the Node case into smaller steps, possibly using 'have' statements to establish intermediate results.\n\n8. Verification:\n   After completing the proof, ensure that all cases are covered and that the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any 'sorry' statements.\n",
