    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"not (P or Q)\" is logically equivalent to \"(not P and not Q)\"\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'proof' command to start the proof\n   - Since it's an iff statement, we'll likely need to prove both directions separately\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (left to right):\n   - Assume the left side: ¬(P ∨ Q)\n   - Goal: Prove (¬P ∧ ¬Q)\n   - Strategy: Use contradiction or case analysis on P and Q\n\n4. Prove the backward direction (right to left):\n   - Assume the right side: (¬P ∧ ¬Q)\n   - Goal: Prove ¬(P ∨ Q)\n   - Strategy: Use contradiction or direct proof\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's automated tools:\n   - Try using 'auto' or 'simp' tactics for simpler steps\n   - If needed, use 'blast' or 'metis' for more complex logical reasoning\n\n6. Apply specific tactics:\n   - Use 'rule' tactic with de Morgan's laws if available\n   - Apply 'cases' tactic if case analysis is needed\n\n7. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are solved\n   - Use 'qed' to complete the proof\n\n8. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Check if the proof is clear and concise\n   - Consider if there are alternative, more elegant approaches\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure and approach used in the previous attempt were logically correct and appropriate for the given theorem. The error encountered is not related to the proof itself but to a database issue in the Isabelle environment. Therefore, our reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. The proof strategy remains valid and doesn't need modification.\n2. The acting agent should focus on resolving the technical issue rather than changing the proof.\n3. Once the environment is properly set up, the same proof structure can be resubmitted.\n\nRecommended actions for the acting agent:\n\n1. Verify the Isabelle environment setup:\n   - Check if Isabelle is correctly installed and up-to-date.\n   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.\n\n2. Address the database issue:\n   - Check the SQLite database used by Isabelle for any corruption or permission issues.\n   - Consider clearing the Isabelle cache or session information.\n   - If possible, recreate or reset the database to resolve the primary key constraint failure.\n\n3. Once the technical issues are resolved, resubmit the exact same proof:\n   \n   theorem not_or_iff: \n     \"\\<not> (P \\<or> Q) \\<longleftrightarrow> (\\<not> P \\<and> \\<not> Q)\"\n   proof\n     show \"\\<not> (P \\<or> Q) \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not> P \\<and> \\<not> Q\"\n       by auto\n     show \"\\<not> P \\<and> \\<not> Q \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not> (P \\<or> Q)\"\n       by auto\n   qed\n\nThis proof is concise, correct, and effectively uses Isabelle's automation to prove both directions of the equivalence. Once the environment issues are resolved, this proof should successfully certify the theorem.\n",
