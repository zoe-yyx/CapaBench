    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem iter_S:\n\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: iter n f (f x) = iter (Suc n) f x\n   - We need to prove this equality for all natural numbers n, functions f, and values x\n\n2. Identify Key Components:\n   - The iter function is defined recursively\n   - There are two cases in the function definition: for 0 and for Suc n\n\n3. Proof Strategy: Induction on n\n   - Since iter is defined recursively on natural numbers, induction on n is a natural approach\n\n4. Base Case (n = 0):\n   - Prove: iter 0 f (f x) = iter (Suc 0) f x\n\n5. Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for n (Induction Hypothesis)\n   - Prove it holds for Suc n\n\n6. Proof Outline:\n   a. Start with induction on n\n   b. For base case (n = 0):\n      - Expand both sides using the definition of iter\n      - Show they are equal\n   c. For inductive step:\n      - Assume: iter n f (f x) = iter (Suc n) f x (Induction Hypothesis)\n      - Prove: iter (Suc n) f (f x) = iter (Suc (Suc n)) f x\n      - Use the definition of iter and the induction hypothesis\n\n7. Potential Simplification Techniques:\n   - Use simp to simplify expressions involving iter\n   - Apply the definition of iter explicitly when needed\n\n8. Conclusion:\n   - Combine base case and inductive step to complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem iter_S using induction on n, which aligns well with the recursive definition of the iter function.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the nature of the theorem iter_S, we should start by applying induction on the natural number n. This approach aligns with the recursive definition of the iter function and will allow us to prove the theorem for all natural numbers.\n\nThe reasoning for this approach is as follows:\n\n1. The iter function is defined recursively on natural numbers, with base case 0 and inductive case Suc n.\n2. The theorem iter_S involves iter applied to n and Suc n, which naturally suggests induction on n.\n3. Induction will allow us to prove the base case (n = 0) and then show that if the theorem holds for n, it also holds for Suc n.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in the proof process should be to apply induction on n. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof, allowing us to tackle the base case and inductive step separately.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with initiating the induction proof on n.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type definition of the 'iter' function, specifically with the arrow symbols used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbols (⇒) with the ASCII representation (=>) in the 'iter' function definition to resolve the lexical error and proceed with the induction proof.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the current unsatisfactory result is primarily due to a syntax issue in the function definition, rather than a problem with the proof strategy itself. The use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒) caused a lexical error that prevented Isabelle from parsing the type correctly.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should modify the 'iter' function definition by replacing the Unicode arrows with ASCII arrows (=>). This should resolve the lexical error.\n\n2. After fixing the syntax, the proof structure using induction on n is correct and should be maintained.\n\n3. The use of 'sorry' in the proof skeleton is appropriate for now as it allows the structure to be set up. However, these placeholders will need to be replaced with actual proof steps in the next iterations.\n\n4. Once the syntax is corrected, the reasoning agent should focus on proving the base case (n = 0) and the inductive step (Suc n) separately, using the definition of the 'iter' function.\n\n5. The overall goal of proving the theorem remains unchanged, and the current approach of using induction is still valid and aligns well with this objective.\n\nBy addressing the syntax issue and then proceeding with the planned induction proof, the LLM agents should be able to make progress towards successfully proving the iter_S theorem in the upcoming rounds.",
