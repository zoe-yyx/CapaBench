    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem iter_S:\n\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: iter n f (f x) = iter (Suc n) f x\n   - We need to prove this equality for all natural numbers n, functions f, and values x\n\n2. Identify Key Components:\n   - The iter function is defined recursively\n   - There are two cases in the function definition: for 0 and for Suc n\n\n3. Proof Strategy: Induction on n\n   - Since iter is defined recursively on natural numbers, induction on n is a natural approach\n\n4. Base Case (n = 0):\n   - Prove: iter 0 f (f x) = iter (Suc 0) f x\n\n5. Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for n (Induction Hypothesis)\n   - Prove it holds for Suc n\n\n6. Proof Outline:\n   a. Start with induction on n\n   b. For base case (n = 0):\n      - Expand both sides using the definition of iter\n      - Show they are equal\n   c. For inductive step:\n      - Assume: iter n f (f x) = iter (Suc n) f x (Induction Hypothesis)\n      - Prove: iter (Suc n) f (f x) = iter (Suc (Suc n)) f x\n      - Use the definition of iter and the induction hypothesis\n\n7. Potential Simplification Techniques:\n   - Use simp to simplify expressions involving iter\n   - Apply the definition of iter explicitly when needed\n\n8. Conclusion:\n   - Combine base case and inductive step to complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem iter_S using induction on n, which aligns well with the recursive definition of the iter function.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The first priority is to correct the syntax in the 'iter' function definition. Replace the Unicode arrows (â‡’) with ASCII arrows (=>). This should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to parse the type correctly.\n\n2. Maintain Induction Structure:\n   The current proof structure using induction on n is correct and should be kept. This aligns well with the recursive definition of the 'iter' function and the nature of the theorem we're trying to prove.\n\n3. Prove Base Case (n = 0):\n   For the base case, we need to show that:\n   iter 0 f (f x) = iter (Suc 0) f x\n   \n   Strategy:\n   - Expand both sides using the definition of 'iter'\n   - For the left side: iter 0 f (f x) = f x (by definition)\n   - For the right side: iter (Suc 0) f x = f (iter 0 f x) = f x (by definition)\n   - Both sides reduce to f x, proving equality\n\n4. Prove Inductive Step (Suc n):\n   Assume the induction hypothesis: iter n f (f x) = iter (Suc n) f x\n   We need to prove: iter (Suc n) f (f x) = iter (Suc (Suc n)) f x\n   \n   Strategy:\n   - Expand both sides using the definition of 'iter'\n   - Use the induction hypothesis to simplify\n   - Show that both sides are equal\n\n5. Use of Simplification:\n   Encourage the use of the 'simp' method to simplify expressions involving 'iter', especially when applying the function's definition.\n\n6. Replace 'sorry':\n   As we develop the proof for each case, replace the 'sorry' placeholders with actual proof steps.\n\nBy following this reasoning, the acting agent should be able to correct the syntax issue and then proceed with proving both the base case and the inductive step, making significant progress towards completing the proof of the iter_S theorem.\n",
