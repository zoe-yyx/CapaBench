    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is named \"or_intror\".\n   - It involves two boolean variables A and B.\n   - We have an assumption H that states B is true.\n   - We need to prove \"A ∨ B\" (A or B).\n\n2. Identify the Logical Structure:\n   - The goal is a disjunction (OR) of A and B.\n   - We don't have any information about A, but we know B is true.\n   - This suggests we should focus on the right side of the disjunction.\n\n3. Plan the Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the right introduction rule for disjunction.\n   - This rule states that if we can prove B, we can conclude A ∨ B.\n   - We already have B as an assumption, so this should be straightforward.\n\n4. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof.\n   b. Apply the right introduction rule for disjunction.\n   c. Use the assumption H to prove B.\n   d. Conclude the proof.\n\n5. Consider Potential Isabelle Tactics:\n   - The 'rule' tactic might be useful for applying the disjunction introduction rule.\n   - The 'assumption' tactic can be used to prove B from the given assumption.\n\n6. Prepare for Potential Challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to explain each step clearly.\n   - Ensure that the correct disjunction introduction rule is applied.\n\n7. Plan for Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, verify that all goals have been discharged.\n   - Ensure that the proof uses only the given assumption and logical rules.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt is incomplete and doesn't properly establish the disjunction \"A ∨ B\". To correct this, we need to explicitly apply the right introduction rule for disjunction before proving B. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start the proof by applying the right introduction rule for disjunction (disjI2). This sets up the correct structure for proving \"A ∨ B\" by focusing on the right-hand side of the disjunction.\n\n2. After applying this rule, the goal will change to proving just \"B\", which aligns with our given assumption.\n\n3. Use the assumption H to prove \"B\", as was done in the previous attempt.\n\n4. Ensure the proof is complete by using 'qed' at the end.\n\nThis approach follows the logical structure of the theorem, first introducing the disjunction and then proving the relevant part using the given assumption. It aligns with our initial plan and corrects the flaw identified in the reflection.\n\nThe acting agent should modify the proof to follow this structure, which will lead to a correct and complete proof of the theorem.\n",
