Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is named \"or_intror\".\n   - It involves two boolean variables A and B.\n   - We have an assumption H that states B is true.\n   - We need to prove \"A ∨ B\" (A or B).\n\n2. Identify the Logical Structure:\n   - The goal is a disjunction (OR) of A and B.\n   - We don't have any information about A, but we know B is true.\n   - This suggests we should focus on the right side of the disjunction.\n\n3. Plan the Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the right introduction rule for disjunction.\n   - This rule states that if we can prove B, we can conclude A ∨ B.\n   - We already have B as an assumption, so this should be straightforward.\n\n4. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof.\n   b. Apply the right introduction rule for disjunction.\n   c. Use the assumption H to prove B.\n   d. Conclude the proof.\n\n5. Consider Potential Isabelle Tactics:\n   - The 'rule' tactic might be useful for applying the disjunction introduction rule.\n   - The 'assumption' tactic can be used to prove B from the given assumption.\n\n6. Prepare for Potential Challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to explain each step clearly.\n   - Ensure that the correct disjunction introduction rule is applied.\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven the problem statement and our planning strategy, we should start by applying the right introduction rule for disjunction. This is because we have the assumption H that states B is true, and we need to prove A ∨ B.\n\nThe right introduction rule for disjunction states that if we can prove B, we can conclude A ∨ B. This aligns perfectly with our situation, as we already have B as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the first step in our proof should be to apply this rule. In Isabelle, this can typically be done using the 'rule' tactic with the appropriate disjunction introduction rule.\n\nAfter applying this rule, our goal should change to proving B, which we can then easily prove using the assumption H.\n\nSo, our reasoning suggests that the acting agent should start by applying the right introduction rule for disjunction. This will set up the proof structure correctly and allow us to use our given assumption effectively in the next step.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is incorrect, as it doesn't properly use the disjunction introduction rule to prove \"A ∨ B\".\n\nImprovement: Apply the disjunction introduction rule explicitly using 'rule disjI2' before showing \"B\" to correctly structure the proof for \"A ∨ B\".\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt, while correctly showing \"B\" using the assumption H, fails to properly establish the disjunction \"A ∨ B\". The proof structure doesn't reflect the logical steps needed to introduce a disjunction.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Start by applying the right introduction rule for disjunction (disjI2) explicitly. This sets up the correct proof structure for \"A ∨ B\".\n\n2. After applying the rule, we'll need to prove \"B\", which can be done using the assumption H as already shown.\n\n3. Ensure that the proof is complete and doesn't rely on any 'sorry' statements.\n\nThe acting agent should modify the proof to something like this:\n\n```isabelle\nproof (rule disjI2)\n  show \"B\" using H by assumption\nqed\n```\n\nThis structure correctly applies the disjunction introduction rule first, then proves the right-hand side of the disjunction using the given assumption. This approach aligns better with the logical structure of the theorem and should lead to a successful proof.\n\nFor future proofs, it's important to carefully consider the structure of the goal and apply appropriate introduction rules before using assumptions or other tactics. This ensures that the proof follows a logical and complete path to the desired conclusion.",
