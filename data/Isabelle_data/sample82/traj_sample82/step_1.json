    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that 6 is not prime.\n   - We need to show that there exists a number n and q where 2 ≤ n < 6 and n * q = 6.\n\n2. Choose the witness:\n   - Select n = 2 and q = 3 as our witnesses.\n   - These values satisfy the conditions: 2 ≤ 2 < 6 and 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n3. Proof structure:\n   - Use the existential introduction rule (exI) twice to introduce n and q.\n   - Then use the conjunction introduction rule (conjI) to prove the three parts of the conjunction.\n\n4. Prove the individual parts:\n   a. Show 2 ≤ n (which is trivial since n = 2)\n   b. Show n < 6 (which is also straightforward since 2 < 6)\n   c. Show n * q = 6 (which is true since 2 * 3 = 6)\n\n5. Use automation:\n   - After introducing the witnesses, try using 'auto' or 'simp' to prove the remaining goals.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates that 6 is not prime because it has a factor (2) that is greater than 1 and less than itself.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is correct, but we need to address the type inconsistencies and provide more explicit proof steps. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Specify the type of the witnesses as natural numbers (nat) when introducing them with the existential introduction rule. This will ensure consistent typing across all subgoals.\n\n2. Break down the conjunction into separate subgoals and prove each part individually. This approach will give us more control over each step of the proof.\n\n3. Use the 'simp' tactic for simple arithmetic facts, and if needed, supplement it with the 'arith' method for more complex arithmetic reasoning.\n\n4. Prove each subgoal separately using appropriate tactics or proof methods, ensuring that we address the type consistency issue.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to complete the proof successfully while maintaining type consistency and providing a clear, step-by-step demonstration of why 6 is not prime.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails due to type inconsistency, as the existential quantifiers are not properly typed, leading to ambiguous type variables in the goal.\n\nImprovement: Explicitly specify the type of n and q as natural numbers (nat) in the theorem statement and use appropriate type annotations throughout the proof to ensure consistent typing.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The main issue is that the original theorem statement doesn't specify the types of n and q, which leads to ambiguous type variables in the goal. This causes problems when we try to introduce specific natural number values in the proof.\n\n2. The attempt to introduce type annotations in the proof steps is not sufficient, as the type ambiguity stems from the theorem statement itself.\n\n3. To improve the situation, we should modify the theorem statement to explicitly specify that n and q are of type nat. This will ensure that all subsequent steps in the proof are working with the correct types.\n\n4. After fixing the type issue in the theorem statement, we should maintain consistent type annotations throughout the proof to avoid any potential type mismatches.\n\n5. The overall structure of the proof attempt is correct, but it needs to be adjusted to work with the properly typed theorem statement.\n\nFor the next steps, the planning and reasoning agents should focus on:\n\n1. Modifying the theorem statement to include explicit type annotations for n and q.\n2. Adjusting the proof structure to work with the new, properly typed theorem statement.\n3. Ensuring that all introduced values and comparisons are consistently typed as natural numbers.\n4. Breaking down the proof into clear, manageable steps that address each part of the conjunction separately.\n\nBy addressing these points, we should be able to successfully prove the theorem without type inconsistencies and provide a clear demonstration of why 6 is not prime.",
