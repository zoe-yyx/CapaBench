    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that 6 is not prime.\n   - We need to show that there exists a number n and q where 2 ≤ n < 6 and n * q = 6.\n\n2. Choose the witness:\n   - Select n = 2 and q = 3 as our witnesses.\n   - These values satisfy the conditions: 2 ≤ 2 < 6 and 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n3. Proof structure:\n   - Use the existential introduction rule (exI) twice to introduce n and q.\n   - Then use the conjunction introduction rule (conjI) to prove the three parts of the conjunction.\n\n4. Prove the individual parts:\n   a. Show 2 ≤ n (which is trivial since n = 2)\n   b. Show n < 6 (which is also straightforward since 2 < 6)\n   c. Show n * q = 6 (which is true since 2 * 3 = 6)\n\n5. Use automation:\n   - After introducing the witnesses, try using 'auto' or 'simp' to prove the remaining goals.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates that 6 is not prime because it has a factor (2) that is greater than 1 and less than itself.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the lemma \"six_is_not_prime\", we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by applying the existential introduction rule (exI) twice to introduce our chosen witnesses n = 2 and q = 3. This will set up the structure of our proof.\n\n2. After introducing the witnesses, we'll need to prove the conjunction of three conditions: 2 ≤ n, n < 6, and n * q = 6.\n\n3. We can use the conjunction introduction rule (conjI) to break down this conjunction into three separate goals.\n\n4. For each of these goals, the proof should be straightforward since we've chosen appropriate witnesses:\n   - 2 ≤ 2 is trivially true\n   - 2 < 6 is also clearly true\n   - 2 * 3 = 6 is a simple arithmetic fact\n\n5. Given the simplicity of these goals, we can likely use automation to complete the proof. The 'auto' or 'simp' tactic should be able to handle all three parts simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent start by applying the existential introduction rule twice with our chosen witnesses, followed by attempting to use the 'auto' tactic to complete the proof. If 'auto' doesn't fully solve the goal, we can then break it down further using conjI and address each part individually.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof failed due to type inconsistencies across the subgoals, preventing the 'auto' tactic from solving them simultaneously.\n\nImprovement: Explicitly specify the type of the variables as natural numbers (nat) when introducing the witnesses, and use more specific tactics like 'simp' or individual proof steps for each subgoal to ensure consistent typing and successful proof completion.\n```\n\nThe current approach was close, but it encountered issues with type consistency. The Isabelle/HOL system inferred different types for the constants in each subgoal ('b, 'c, 'd), which prevented the 'auto' tactic from solving all subgoals at once.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Explicitly specify the type of the witnesses as natural numbers (nat) when introducing them with the existential introduction rule. This ensures consistent typing across all subgoals.\n\n2. Instead of using 'auto' to prove all subgoals at once, we should either:\n   a) Use the 'simp' tactic, which is often more effective for arithmetic facts, or\n   b) Break down the conjunction and prove each part separately using specific tactics or proof methods.\n\n3. If needed, we can use the 'arith' method for arithmetic facts that 'simp' alone might not solve.\n\n4. Consider using the 'by' keyword for each individual proof step rather than for the entire proof block, to have more granular control over the proof process.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to successfully complete the proof without encountering type inconsistencies or relying too heavily on automation that might fail in more complex scenarios.",
