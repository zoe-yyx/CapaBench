    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that 6 is not prime.\n   - We need to show that there exists a number n and q where 2 ≤ n < 6 and n * q = 6.\n\n2. Choose the witness:\n   - Select n = 2 and q = 3 as our witnesses.\n   - These values satisfy the conditions: 2 ≤ 2 < 6 and 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n3. Proof structure:\n   - Use the existential introduction rule (exI) twice to introduce n and q.\n   - Then use the conjunction introduction rule (conjI) to prove the three parts of the conjunction.\n\n4. Prove the individual parts:\n   a. Show 2 ≤ n (which is trivial since n = 2)\n   b. Show n < 6 (which is also straightforward since 2 < 6)\n   c. Show n * q = 6 (which is true since 2 * 3 = 6)\n\n5. Use automation:\n   - After introducing the witnesses, try using 'auto' or 'simp' to prove the remaining goals.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates that 6 is not prime because it has a factor (2) that is greater than 1 and less than itself.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Type Specification:\n   The theorem statement needs to be modified to explicitly specify the types of n and q as natural numbers. This will resolve the type ambiguity issue.\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   After fixing the type issue, we should maintain the overall proof structure, which is correct. We'll use existential introduction (exI) for both n and q, followed by conjunction introduction (conjI) to prove the three parts of the statement.\n\n3. Witness Selection:\n   We'll keep our original witnesses: n = 2 and q = 3. These values satisfy all conditions of the theorem.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Approach:\n   Break down the proof into clear steps:\n   a) Introduce n = 2 using exI\n   b) Introduce q = 3 using exI\n   c) Use conjI to split the goal into three subgoals\n   d) Prove 2 ≤ 2 (trivial)\n   e) Prove 2 < 6\n   f) Prove 2 * 3 = 6\n\n5. Automation:\n   After setting up the proof structure, we can use 'simp' or 'auto' to prove the simple arithmetic facts.\n\n6. Explicit Reasoning:\n   If automation doesn't solve all subgoals, we should be prepared to provide explicit reasoning for each step, particularly for the inequalities and the multiplication.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by modifying the theorem statement to include type annotations, then proceed with the proof structure as outlined above. Each step should be clearly stated and typed correctly to avoid further issues.\n",
