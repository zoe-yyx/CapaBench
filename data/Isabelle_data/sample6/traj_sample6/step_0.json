    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the lemma shift_up1_square, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by unfolding the definitions of both 'shift_up1' and 'square'. This will allow us to see the expanded form of the left-hand side of the equation.\n\n2. After unfolding, we should have an expression that looks like:\n   (square x) + 1 = x * x + 1\n\n3. The definition of 'square' will further simplify the left side to:\n   (x * x) + 1 = x * x + 1\n\n4. At this point, the equality should be apparent, and Isabelle's simplification tools should be able to recognize it.\n\n5. Given the straightforward nature of this lemma, we can attempt to prove it using Isabelle's automated proof methods.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the following course of action for the acting agent:\n\n1. Begin the proof.\n2. Unfold the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square'.\n3. Apply Isabelle's simplification or auto proof method.\n4. If the proof is not completed automatically, consider manual algebraic steps or further unfolding of definitions.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type definition, specifically with the arrow symbol \"⇒\".\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"->\" in type definitions to ensure compatibility and avoid lexical errors in Isabelle/HOL.\n```\n\nThe current result is unsatisfactory because the proof attempt couldn't even begin due to a parsing error in the type definitions. This error occurs because Isabelle may not be configured to handle Unicode symbols in this context, or there might be an encoding issue.\n\nTo improve the next steps, we should focus on using ASCII representations for special symbols in the theory file. Specifically, we need to replace all instances of \"⇒\" with \"->\". This change should be applied to both the `square` and `shift_up1` definitions.\n\nFor future actions, it's important to ensure that all symbols used in the theory file are compatible with Isabelle's parser. When in doubt, using ASCII equivalents for special symbols is a safe approach. This will help avoid similar parsing errors and allow us to focus on the actual proof steps.\n\nThe acting agent should modify the theory file accordingly, replacing the Unicode arrows with ASCII arrows, and then attempt to run the proof again. Once this syntax issue is resolved, we can proceed with the planned proof steps as outlined in the previous thought.",
