    "reasoning": "\nThe first step in solving this problem is to address the lexical error that's preventing the theory from being parsed correctly. The error is caused by the use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒) in the type definitions, which Isabelle is not interpreting correctly in this context.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to replace all instances of the Unicode arrow (⇒) with its ASCII equivalent (->). This change should be applied to both the `square` and `shift_up1` definitions.\n\nAfter making these modifications, the definitions should look like this:\n\ndefinition square :: \"int -> int\" where\n\"square x = x * x\"\n\ndefinition shift_up1 :: \"(int -> int) -> int -> int\" where\n\"shift_up1 f x = f x + 1\"\n\nOnce these changes are made, the acting agent should attempt to load the theory file again. If successful, we can then proceed with the proof as originally planned.\n\nThe next steps after fixing the syntax would be:\n\n1. Unfold the definition of `shift_up1` using `shift_up1_def`.\n2. Unfold the definition of `square` using `square_def`.\n3. Simplify the resulting expressions.\n4. Show that the simplified left-hand side equals the right-hand side.\n\nThese steps align with the original planning strategy and should lead to a successful proof of the lemma `shift_up1_square`.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists despite the attempted fix, indicating that the replacement of Unicode arrows with ASCII arrows was not correctly implemented or recognized by Isabelle.\n\nImprovement: We need to carefully review and adjust the syntax of the type definitions, ensuring that the ASCII arrow (->) is correctly formatted and recognized by Isabelle, possibly by adding spaces around it or consulting Isabelle's documentation for the correct syntax.\n```\n\nThe current result is still unsatisfactory because the inner syntax error remains, preventing the theory from being parsed correctly. This suggests that our previous attempt to fix the issue by replacing Unicode arrows with ASCII arrows was not successful or not properly implemented.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Double-check the exact syntax for function type annotations in Isabelle. It's possible that we need to format the ASCII arrow differently, such as adding spaces around it (e.g., \"int -> int\" instead of \"int->int\").\n\n2. Verify that the changes were actually applied to the theory file. It's possible that the modifications were not saved or applied correctly.\n\n3. Consider consulting Isabelle's official documentation or examples to ensure we're using the correct syntax for type definitions.\n\n4. If the issue persists, we might need to investigate if there are any other syntax issues in the theory file that we've overlooked.\n\n5. As a last resort, we could try rewriting the definitions using alternative syntax that Isabelle might accept, such as using `⇒` instead of `->` if Isabelle supports Unicode input in this context.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should carefully review and adjust the syntax of the type definitions, paying close attention to the formatting of the function arrows. Once the syntax issues are resolved, we can proceed with the proof steps as originally planned.",
