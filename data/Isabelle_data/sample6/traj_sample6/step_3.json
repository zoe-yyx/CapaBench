    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given definitions:\n   - Review the definition of 'square'\n   - Review the definition of 'shift_up1'\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Analyze the left-hand side: shift_up1 square x\n   - Analyze the right-hand side: x * x + 1\n\n3. Unfold definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'shift_up1'\n   - Then unfold the definition of 'square'\n\n4. Simplification strategy:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the expressions\n   - Use Isabelle's simplification tools\n\n5. Equality proof:\n   - Show that the simplified left-hand side equals the right-hand side\n\n6. Automation:\n   - Try using Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'simp'\n\n7. Manual steps (if needed):\n   - If automation fails, proceed with manual proof steps\n   - Use algebraic manipulation if required\n\n8. Finalization:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check for any remaining goals\n\n9. Verification:\n   - Review the completed proof\n   - Ensure it's concise and logically sound\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Proof Completion: The proof for the lemma 'shift_up1_square' appears to be complete and correct. The steps taken in the proof are logical and follow the planned strategy:\n   - The definition of 'shift_up1' was unfolded.\n   - The definition of 'square' was then applied.\n   - The proof was completed using simplification and transitivity of equality.\n\n2. Error Diagnosis: The current observation shows a database-related error, which is not related to the proof itself. This error is likely a system-level issue and does not indicate any problem with our Isabelle proof.\n\n3. Verification Need: Despite the apparent correctness of our proof, we lack confirmation from Isabelle due to the database error. We need to find a way to verify that Isabelle accepts our proof without relying on the database functionality.\n\n4. Next Steps:\n   a. Request a method to run the proof directly in Isabelle, bypassing any database operations if possible.\n   b. If direct Isabelle access is not available, ask for a text-based output of Isabelle's response to our theory file.\n   c. In the absence of Isabelle verification, perform a manual review of the proof to ensure its logical soundness.\n\n5. Proof Review: If manual review is necessary, focus on:\n   - Correctness of definitions for 'square' and 'shift_up1'\n   - Proper unfolding of these definitions in the proof\n   - Correct application of simplification steps\n   - Validity of the final equality statement\n\n6. Potential Enhancements: While the current proof appears sufficient, consider if any additional steps could make it more robust or clear, such as:\n   - Adding intermediate steps for clarity\n   - Explicitly stating any assumptions or using more verbose proof commands for educational purposes\n\n7. Next Theorem: If the proof is confirmed to be correct, prepare to move on to the next theorem or challenge, as this lemma appears to be successfully proved.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is logically sound, but Isabelle is failing to parse the type notation, specifically the \"⇒\" symbol.\n\nImprovement: Replace the unicode arrow \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\" in type definitions to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that while our proof strategy and logic appear correct, we're facing a technical issue with Isabelle's ability to parse the unicode arrow symbol in our type definitions. This is preventing Isabelle from even reaching the proof stage.\n\nTo address this:\n\n1. We should modify our type definitions to use ASCII symbols instead of unicode. Specifically, replace \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in the definitions of 'square' and 'shift_up1'.\n\n2. After making these changes, we should attempt to run the proof again in Isabelle.\n\n3. If the parsing error is resolved, Isabelle should then be able to process our proof and verify its correctness.\n\n4. We should also consider adopting this ASCII-based notation for future proofs to avoid similar parsing issues.\n\n5. Once the syntax is corrected, we can focus on verifying that the logical structure of our proof is accepted by Isabelle.\n\nThis approach should allow us to overcome the current technical hurdle and move forward with verifying our proof in Isabelle.",
