    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given definitions:\n   - Review the definition of 'square'\n   - Review the definition of 'shift_up1'\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Analyze the left-hand side: shift_up1 square x\n   - Analyze the right-hand side: x * x + 1\n\n3. Unfold definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'shift_up1'\n   - Then unfold the definition of 'square'\n\n4. Simplification strategy:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the expressions\n   - Use Isabelle's simplification tools\n\n5. Equality proof:\n   - Show that the simplified left-hand side equals the right-hand side\n\n6. Automation:\n   - Try using Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'simp'\n\n7. Manual steps (if needed):\n   - If automation fails, proceed with manual proof steps\n   - Use algebraic manipulation if required\n\n8. Finalization:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check for any remaining goals\n\n9. Verification:\n   - Review the completed proof\n   - Ensure it's concise and logically sound\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is not with the proof logic, but with the syntax used in the theory file. The Unicode arrow (⇒) is causing parsing errors in Isabelle. To resolve this, we need to modify our code to use ASCII-compatible syntax. Here's what we should do:\n\n1. Replace all instances of the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>).\n\n2. Specifically, modify the following lines:\n   - Change \"square :: \"int ⇒ int\"\" to \"square :: \"int => int\"\"\n   - Change \"shift_up1 :: \"(int ⇒ int) ⇒ int ⇒ int\"\" to \"shift_up1 :: \"(int => int) => int => int\"\"\n\n3. Keep the rest of the proof structure intact, as it appears to be logically correct.\n\n4. After making these changes, attempt to run the proof again.\n\n5. If the proof is accepted without errors, we can consider this problem solved.\n\n6. If any new issues arise after fixing the syntax, we should analyze them and adjust our approach accordingly.\n\nRemember, when working with Isabelle, it's crucial to use ASCII-compatible syntax to avoid parsing errors. This experience highlights the importance of syntax compatibility in addition to logical correctness when working with proof assistants.\n",
