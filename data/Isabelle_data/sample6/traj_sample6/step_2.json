    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given definitions:\n   - Review the definition of 'square'\n   - Review the definition of 'shift_up1'\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Analyze the left-hand side: shift_up1 square x\n   - Analyze the right-hand side: x * x + 1\n\n3. Unfold definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'shift_up1'\n   - Then unfold the definition of 'square'\n\n4. Simplification strategy:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the expressions\n   - Use Isabelle's simplification tools\n\n5. Equality proof:\n   - Show that the simplified left-hand side equals the right-hand side\n\n6. Automation:\n   - Try using Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'simp'\n\n7. Manual steps (if needed):\n   - If automation fails, proceed with manual proof steps\n   - Use algebraic manipulation if required\n\n8. Finalization:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check for any remaining goals\n\n9. Verification:\n   - Review the completed proof\n   - Ensure it's concise and logically sound\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe persistent syntax error indicates that our previous attempt to fix the arrow notation was not successful. We need to focus on correctly formatting the function type annotations in the definitions. Here's what we should do:\n\n1. Adjust the syntax of the type definitions:\n   - For the 'square' definition, change \"int -> int\" to \"int ⇒ int\"\n   - For the 'shift_up1' definition, change \"(int -> int) -> int -> int\" to \"(int ⇒ int) ⇒ int ⇒ int\"\n\n2. Ensure proper spacing:\n   - Add spaces around the arrows (⇒) to improve readability and prevent parsing issues\n\n3. Verify Unicode support:\n   - If Isabelle supports Unicode input in this context, using ⇒ instead of -> should resolve the syntax error\n\n4. Review the entire theory file:\n   - Check for any other instances of -> that need to be replaced with ⇒\n   - Ensure there are no other syntax issues in the remaining parts of the theory\n\n5. After making these changes, attempt to reload the theory file in Isabelle\n\n6. If the syntax error is resolved, proceed with the proof steps as originally planned:\n   - Unfold the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square'\n   - Use simplification to prove the equality\n\nBy carefully addressing the syntax issue with the function type annotations, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and move forward with the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The error message indicates a database constraint issue, which is unrelated to our Isabelle proof or syntax corrections.\nImprovement: We should focus on verifying the successful execution of our proof in Isabelle, as the database error is likely a system-level issue outside of our control.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current error is not directly related to our proof or the previous syntax corrections we made. The SQLite constraint error suggests an issue with the database used by the system running Isabelle, rather than a problem with our proof or theory file.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. We should confirm that our syntax corrections were successful by attempting to run the proof in Isabelle directly, if possible.\n\n2. If direct access to Isabelle is not available, we should request a different method of verifying our proof, such as using a different proof assistant or a text-based output of Isabelle's response to our theory file.\n\n3. We should also inquire about the system setup and whether there are any known issues with the database that Isabelle is using, as this could be affecting the ability to save or process our proof.\n\n4. In the meantime, we can review our proof steps to ensure they are logically sound and complete:\n   - The definitions of 'square' and 'shift_up1' appear correct.\n   - The proof structure for 'shift_up1_square' looks appropriate, unfolding definitions and using simplification.\n\n5. If we receive confirmation that the proof is being processed correctly by Isabelle (ignoring the database error), we can consider the proof complete and move on to the next challenge or refinement.\n\n6. If we're unable to get confirmation due to the database issue, we should prepare alternative ways to verify our proof, such as manual checking or using a different tool that can parse Isabelle syntax.\n\nThe key is to separate the proof-related aspects, which seem to be on the right track, from the system-level database issue, which requires attention from the system administrators or those managing the Isabelle environment.",
