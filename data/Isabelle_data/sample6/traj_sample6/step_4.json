    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given definitions:\n   - Review the definition of 'square'\n   - Review the definition of 'shift_up1'\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Analyze the left-hand side: shift_up1 square x\n   - Analyze the right-hand side: x * x + 1\n\n3. Unfold definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'shift_up1'\n   - Then unfold the definition of 'square'\n\n4. Simplification strategy:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the expressions\n   - Use Isabelle's simplification tools\n\n5. Equality proof:\n   - Show that the simplified left-hand side equals the right-hand side\n\n6. Automation:\n   - Try using Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'simp'\n\n7. Manual steps (if needed):\n   - If automation fails, proceed with manual proof steps\n   - Use algebraic manipulation if required\n\n8. Finalization:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check for any remaining goals\n\n9. Verification:\n   - Review the completed proof\n   - Ensure it's concise and logically sound\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a parsing error due to the use of unicode symbols in type definitions. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we should:\n\n1. Modify the type definitions to use ASCII symbols instead of unicode. Specifically:\n   - Change \"int ⇒ int\" to \"int => int\" in the definition of 'square'\n   - Change \"(int ⇒ int) ⇒ int ⇒ int\" to \"(int => int) => int => int\" in the definition of 'shift_up1'\n\n2. Keep the proof structure intact, as it appears logically sound. The steps involving unfolding definitions and simplification should work once the parsing issue is resolved.\n\n3. After making these changes, attempt to run the entire proof again in Isabelle.\n\n4. If Isabelle accepts the modified syntax, it should be able to process and verify the proof.\n\n5. Pay attention to any new messages or errors that Isabelle might produce after this change, as they will guide any further necessary adjustments.\n\n6. If the proof is accepted without further issues, we can consider this theorem proven and move on to the next challenge or refinement of the proof if needed.\n\nThis approach addresses the immediate syntactical issue while maintaining the logical structure of the proof, allowing us to progress in verifying the theorem in Isabelle.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof appears correct, but we're encountering a database constraint error unrelated to the proof itself.\nImprovement: We should investigate the Isabelle environment setup, focusing on potential issues with the SQLite database used for session management.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that our current proof structure and logic seem sound, as we don't see any errors related to the theorem or its proof. The error message suggests an issue with Isabelle's internal database management, specifically a primary key constraint failure in the SQLite database used to store session information.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. First, we should verify that this error is not a transient issue. Try running the proof again to see if the error persists.\n\n2. If the error continues, we should check the Isabelle installation and configuration. This may involve:\n   - Ensuring Isabelle is properly installed and up to date\n   - Checking for any corruption in Isabelle's session database\n   - Verifying that we have the necessary permissions to write to Isabelle's database\n\n3. If possible, try to clear Isabelle's session cache or recreate the theory file in a new project to rule out any project-specific issues.\n\n4. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to consult Isabelle's documentation or seek help from the Isabelle community, as this appears to be an environment issue rather than a problem with our proof.\n\n5. In the meantime, we can focus on refining our proof structure and ensuring it's as clear and concise as possible, so we're ready to proceed once the database issue is resolved.\n\n6. Consider documenting this error and the steps taken to resolve it, as it could be valuable information for future troubleshooting or for other users who might encounter similar issues.\n\nThis approach acknowledges that while our proof seems correct, we need to address the underlying system issue before we can fully verify and proceed with our theorem proving process.",
