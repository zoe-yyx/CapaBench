    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"four_is_even\":\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that there exists an n such that 4 equals n + n.\n   - This is equivalent to proving that 4 is even.\n\n2. Choose the value for n:\n   - We need to find a number that, when doubled, equals 4.\n   - The obvious choice is n = 2.\n\n3. Proof structure:\n   - Use existential introduction (∃-intro) to prove the existence claim.\n   - Provide 2 as the witness for n.\n\n4. Proof steps:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∃n. 4 = n + n\n   b. Apply the rule ∃-intro with n = 2\n   c. This will transform the goal into: 4 = 2 + 2\n   d. Simplify the right-hand side: 2 + 2 = 4\n   e. The equality should now be trivial and can be solved automatically\n\n5. Potential Isabelle tactics to use:\n   - apply (rule exI)  -- for existential introduction\n   - apply simp  -- for simplification\n   - by auto  -- to finish off trivial arithmetic\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step in the proof is accepted by Isabelle\n   - Check that the final proof is complete with no remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a straightforward approach to proving that 4 is even by demonstrating that it can be expressed as the sum of a number (2) with itself, which is the definition of an even number.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Theorem Statement Modification:\n   The primary issue is the parsing error caused by the Unicode existential quantifier symbol. We need to modify the theorem statement to use the ASCII representation \"\\<exists>\" instead of \"∃\".\n\n2. Proof Structure Preservation:\n   The overall proof structure appears to be correct and follows the initial planning strategy. We should maintain this structure in the next attempt.\n\n3. Step-by-Step Approach:\n   After correcting the theorem statement, we should proceed with the proof in a step-by-step manner to ensure each part is processed correctly by Isabelle.\n\n4. Explicit Rule Application:\n   To make the proof more robust and easier to debug, we should explicitly apply the existential introduction rule with the witness value of 2.\n\n5. Simplification and Automation:\n   After applying the existential introduction, we can use simplification to show that 4 = 2 + 2, which should be trivial for Isabelle to prove.\n\n6. Error Monitoring:\n   While fixing the parsing error should resolve the immediate issue, we should be vigilant for any additional errors that may occur, particularly related to the database issues mentioned in the error messages.\n\nRecommended Next Steps:\n1. Rewrite the theorem statement using \"\\<exists>\" instead of \"∃\".\n2. Apply the existential introduction rule explicitly with 2 as the witness.\n3. Use simplification to prove the resulting equality.\n4. If successful, conclude the proof; if not, analyze any new errors that arise.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof itself appears correct, but a database constraint error is preventing successful execution.\n\nImprovement: We need to investigate and resolve the database issue, possibly by clearing cached session information or recreating the theory file, before re-running the proof.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and logic seem to be correct. We've successfully addressed the previous parsing issue by using the correct ASCII representation for the existential quantifier (\"\\<exists>\"). The proof steps are clear and concise, using the existential introduction rule and simplification as recommended.\n\nHowever, the new error message indicates a problem with the Isabelle database, specifically a primary key constraint failure in the isabelle_session_info table. This is likely an issue with Isabelle's internal session management rather than with our proof itself.\n\nTo move forward, we should:\n\n1. Try to clear Isabelle's session cache or temporary files if possible.\n2. If that doesn't work, consider creating a new theory file with a different name to avoid potential conflicts with existing session information.\n3. Ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and there are no conflicts with previous sessions or installations.\n4. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to consult Isabelle documentation or support channels for guidance on resolving database-related errors.\n\nOnce the database issue is resolved, we should be able to run the proof as it is, as the logical structure appears sound. After successfully running the proof, we can then focus on any potential optimizations or alternative proof strategies if needed.",
