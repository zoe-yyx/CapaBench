    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"four_is_even\":\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that there exists an n such that 4 equals n + n.\n   - This is equivalent to proving that 4 is even.\n\n2. Choose the value for n:\n   - We need to find a number that, when doubled, equals 4.\n   - The obvious choice is n = 2.\n\n3. Proof structure:\n   - Use existential introduction (∃-intro) to prove the existence claim.\n   - Provide 2 as the witness for n.\n\n4. Proof steps:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∃n. 4 = n + n\n   b. Apply the rule ∃-intro with n = 2\n   c. This will transform the goal into: 4 = 2 + 2\n   d. Simplify the right-hand side: 2 + 2 = 4\n   e. The equality should now be trivial and can be solved automatically\n\n5. Potential Isabelle tactics to use:\n   - apply (rule exI)  -- for existential introduction\n   - apply simp  -- for simplification\n   - by auto  -- to finish off trivial arithmetic\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step in the proof is accepted by Isabelle\n   - Check that the final proof is complete with no remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a straightforward approach to proving that 4 is even by demonstrating that it can be expressed as the sum of a number (2) with itself, which is the definition of an even number.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem \"four_is_even: ∃n. 4 = n + n\", we should follow these logical steps:\n\n1. We need to prove the existence of a number n that, when added to itself, equals 4. The obvious choice for this number is 2.\n\n2. We should start by applying the existential introduction rule (∃-intro) with 2 as our witness. This will transform our goal from proving the existence of such an n to proving that 4 = 2 + 2.\n\n3. After applying the existential introduction, we'll need to simplify and evaluate the resulting equation.\n\n4. The simplification of 2 + 2 should be straightforward and can likely be handled automatically by Isabelle's simplification tactics.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Apply the existential introduction rule with 2 as the witness.\n2. Use simplification tactics to evaluate the resulting equation.\n3. If necessary, use automation to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach directly follows our planning strategy and should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in parsing the theorem statement, specifically with the existential quantifier symbol.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode existential quantifier symbol \"∃\" with its ASCII equivalent \"\\<exists>\" in the theorem statement to ensure proper parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is that Isabelle encountered a lexical error when trying to parse the theorem statement. This is likely due to the use of the Unicode symbol \"∃\" for the existential quantifier, which may not be properly recognized in this context.\n\nTo improve the next attempt, we should modify the theorem statement to use the ASCII representation of the existential quantifier, which is \"\\<exists>\". This should resolve the parsing issue and allow Isabelle to properly process the theorem.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that there seems to be some database-related errors occurring in the background. While these may not directly affect the proof itself, they could potentially cause issues with saving or processing the proof. If these errors persist, it might be necessary to investigate the Isabelle environment setup or consult with system administrators to resolve any file permission or database access issues.\n\nFor the next round, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Modify the theorem statement to use \"\\<exists>\" instead of \"∃\".\n2. Keep the rest of the proof structure the same, as it appears logically correct.\n3. Be prepared to address any additional errors that may arise after fixing the parsing issue.\n\nThis adjustment should allow the proof to proceed without the initial parsing error, enabling us to focus on the actual logic of the proof if any further issues arise.",
