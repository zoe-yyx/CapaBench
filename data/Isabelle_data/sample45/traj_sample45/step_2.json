    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"four_is_even\":\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that there exists an n such that 4 equals n + n.\n   - This is equivalent to proving that 4 is even.\n\n2. Choose the value for n:\n   - We need to find a number that, when doubled, equals 4.\n   - The obvious choice is n = 2.\n\n3. Proof structure:\n   - Use existential introduction (∃-intro) to prove the existence claim.\n   - Provide 2 as the witness for n.\n\n4. Proof steps:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∃n. 4 = n + n\n   b. Apply the rule ∃-intro with n = 2\n   c. This will transform the goal into: 4 = 2 + 2\n   d. Simplify the right-hand side: 2 + 2 = 4\n   e. The equality should now be trivial and can be solved automatically\n\n5. Potential Isabelle tactics to use:\n   - apply (rule exI)  -- for existential introduction\n   - apply simp  -- for simplification\n   - by auto  -- to finish off trivial arithmetic\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step in the proof is accepted by Isabelle\n   - Check that the final proof is complete with no remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a straightforward approach to proving that 4 is even by demonstrating that it can be expressed as the sum of a number (2) with itself, which is the definition of an even number.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure and logic for the theorem \"four_is_even\" appear to be correct. The issue we're facing is not with the proof itself, but with Isabelle's database management. Here's my reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Database Error Resolution:\n   The primary focus should be on resolving the SQLite constraint error. This error is preventing us from verifying the correctness of our proof.\n\n2. Proof Validity:\n   The current proof structure using existential introduction (rule exI) and simplification (simp) is logically sound and should be maintained.\n\n3. Next Actions:\n   a. Attempt to clear Isabelle's session cache or temporary files.\n   b. If the error persists, create a new theory file with a different name to avoid potential conflicts.\n   c. Verify the Isabelle environment setup to ensure no conflicts with previous sessions or installations.\n\n4. Proof Execution:\n   Once the database issue is resolved, run the proof as it is currently written. The structure:\n   proof (rule exI[of _ 2])\n     show \"4 = 2 + 2\" by simp\n   qed\n   is concise and should prove the theorem effectively.\n\n5. Potential Optimizations:\n   After successful execution, consider if any optimizations are necessary. However, given the simplicity of the theorem, the current proof is likely optimal.\n\n6. Alternative Approaches:\n   If for any reason the current proof structure faces issues after resolving the database error, consider alternative approaches such as:\n   - Using 'auto' to prove the entire theorem in one step.\n   - Explicitly calculating the sum: \"have \"2 + 2 = 4\" by auto\" before the existential introduction.\n\nThe primary goal now is to resolve the database issue to allow proper execution and verification of the proof. The acting agent should focus on addressing this technical hurdle rather than modifying the proof itself at this stage.\n",
