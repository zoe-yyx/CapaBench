    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two logical expressions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Prove left-to-right implication (→)\n   - Prove right-to-left implication (←)\n\n3. Left-to-right implication (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on the disjunction:\n     a. Case P: Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n     b. Case (Q ∧ R): Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left implication (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on P:\n     a. If P is true, then P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is immediately true\n     b. If P is false, then Q must be true (from P ∨ Q) and R must be true (from P ∨ R)\n        Show that this implies Q ∧ R, which in turn implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's built-in tactics:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for basic logical steps\n   - Consider using 'auto' for simple logical manipulations\n   - Use 'case_tac' for case analysis\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7. Review and optimize:\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n   - Consider if any steps can be combined or automated further\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The proof structure is correct, but we need to make the bidirectional nature of the equivalence more explicit.\n\n2. For the forward direction (=>):\n   - Use \"show\" to clearly state we're proving \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\" from \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\".\n   - In the case where P is true, explicitly show how this implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R).\n   - In the case where Q ∧ R is true, explicitly show how this implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R).\n\n3. For the backward direction (<=):\n   - Use \"show\" to clearly state we're proving \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\" from \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\".\n   - In the case where P is true, show how this directly implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n   - In the case where ¬P, explicitly derive Q and R from the assumptions, then show how Q ∧ R implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n\n4. Avoid using \"by auto\" or \"by simp\" for crucial steps. Instead, use more explicit reasoning steps that Isabelle can follow.\n\n5. Use \"then\" or \"hence\" to show the logical flow between steps, providing clear justifications for each major step in the proof.\n\n6. After making these changes, use \"done\" to complete each part of the proof and the overall lemma.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is generally correct, but there's an error in the backward direction where we're trying to prove \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\" from \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\" and \"Q\".\n\nImprovement: We need to restructure the backward direction of the proof, considering all possible cases from the assumption \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\" and deriving \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\" more systematically.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt is close to being correct, but there's a crucial error in the backward direction that's causing the proof to fail. Here's a more detailed reflection:\n\n1. The forward direction (=>) of the proof seems to be correct and well-structured.\n\n2. The error occurs in the backward direction (<=), specifically in the case where we assume \"Q\". We're not correctly handling all the information from the assumption \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\".\n\n3. We need to consider that when we have \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\", we can't immediately assume \"Q\". We should instead start by breaking down this conjunction and then considering the cases for each disjunction.\n\n4. The proof should first split \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\" into its two parts, then consider the cases for \"P ∨ Q\". If P is true, we're done. If Q is true, we then need to consider the cases for \"P ∨ R\" to either get P (in which case we're done) or R (in which case we can conclude Q ∧ R).\n\n5. We should avoid introducing new assumptions that aren't directly derived from our given premises. This was part of the issue in the current proof attempt.\n\n6. The use of more explicit reasoning steps instead of automated tactics like \"auto\" or \"simp\" is good and should be continued.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n- Restructure the backward direction to handle all cases systematically.\n- Ensure each step is properly justified and follows logically from the previous steps or assumptions.\n- Continue using explicit proof steps rather than relying on automation.\n- Double-check that all assumptions used in the proof are properly introduced or derived.\n\nBy addressing these points, we should be able to complete the proof successfully in the next attempt.",
