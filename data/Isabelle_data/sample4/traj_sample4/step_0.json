Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two logical expressions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Prove left-to-right implication (→)\n   - Prove right-to-left implication (←)\n\n3. Left-to-right implication (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on the disjunction:\n     a. Case P: Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n     b. Case (Q ∧ R): Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left implication (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on P:\n     a. If P is true, then P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is immediately true\n     b. If P is false, then Q must be true (from P ∨ Q) and R must be true (from P ∨ R)\n        Show that this implies Q ∧ R, which in turn implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's built-in tactics:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for basic logical steps\n   - Consider using 'auto' for simple logical manipulations\n   - Use 'case_tac' for case analysis\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7. Review and optimize:\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n   - Consider if any steps can be combined or automated further\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo start proving the theorem or_and_distr_l, we should follow the planned approach of using the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence. The first step should be to apply the 'iff' tactic, which will set up the proof structure for both directions.\n\nAfter applying 'iff', we'll need to prove two subgoals: the left-to-right implication (→) and the right-to-left implication (←). We should start with the left-to-right implication.\n\nFor the left-to-right implication, we need to assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R) and show that it implies (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R). This can be done using case analysis on the disjunction P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n\nTherefore, the next logical steps for the acting agent should be:\n\n1. Apply the 'iff' tactic to set up the bidirectional proof.\n2. For the resulting left-to-right subgoal, use 'apply (rule disjE)' to perform case analysis on P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n\nThese steps will establish the basic structure of the proof and allow us to proceed with the detailed case analysis for the left-to-right implication.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof uses Unicode symbols (∨, ∧, ↔) which are not compatible with Isabelle's default syntax, causing a lexical error.\n\nImprovement: Replace Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents (\\<or>, \\<and>, \\<longleftrightarrow>) in the theorem statement and throughout the proof to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's syntax.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is the use of Unicode symbols in the theorem statement and proof, which Isabelle's parser cannot handle by default. This is causing a lexical error that prevents the proof from being processed.\n\nTo improve the situation, we need to adjust our approach:\n\n1. Rewrite the theorem statement using ASCII representations of logical symbols:\n   - Replace ∨ with \\<or>\n   - Replace ∧ with \\<and>\n   - Replace ↔ with \\<longleftrightarrow>\n\n2. Similarly, update all occurrences of these symbols throughout the proof.\n\n3. Ensure that all quotation marks used in the proof are ASCII double quotes (\") rather than any special Unicode quotation marks.\n\n4. Review the proof structure to make sure it follows Isabelle's syntax correctly, particularly in terms of indentation and proof blocks.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to process the proof. This will enable us to focus on the logical aspects of the proof rather than syntax issues.\n\nFor future steps, we should be mindful of using Isabelle-compatible syntax from the outset to avoid similar errors. It might be helpful to use an Isabelle-aware editor or IDE that can highlight syntax issues in real-time.",
