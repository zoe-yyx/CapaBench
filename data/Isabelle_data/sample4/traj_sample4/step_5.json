    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two logical expressions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Prove left-to-right implication (→)\n   - Prove right-to-left implication (←)\n\n3. Left-to-right implication (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on the disjunction:\n     a. Case P: Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n     b. Case (Q ∧ R): Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left implication (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on P:\n     a. If P is true, then P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is immediately true\n     b. If P is false, then Q must be true (from P ∨ Q) and R must be true (from P ∨ R)\n        Show that this implies Q ∧ R, which in turn implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's built-in tactics:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for basic logical steps\n   - Consider using 'auto' for simple logical manipulations\n   - Use 'case_tac' for case analysis\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7. Review and optimize:\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n   - Consider if any steps can be combined or automated further\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, our reasoning should focus on addressing the system-level issues rather than modifying the proof itself. The proof structure appears to be correct and follows the planned approach, but the Isabelle system is encountering database-related errors that prevent successful execution and verification.\n\nReasoning for next steps:\n\n1. System Error Resolution: The primary focus should be on resolving the database access issues. The errors indicate that the database file has been moved or is set to read-only mode, preventing the system from writing necessary information. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed before any further progress can be made on the proof.\n\n2. Environment Check: Once the database issues are resolved, it's crucial to perform a thorough check of the Isabelle environment to ensure all components are functioning correctly. This includes verifying file permissions, checking for any missing dependencies, and ensuring the Isabelle installation is up-to-date.\n\n3. Proof Re-execution: After confirming that the system issues are resolved and the environment is stable, the next step should be to re-run the existing proof without any modifications. Given that the proof structure appears correct, it's likely that it will succeed once the system errors are addressed.\n\n4. Proof Verification: If the proof runs successfully after addressing the system issues, carefully review the output to ensure that all steps are correctly processed and that the theorem is indeed proven.\n\n5. Contingency Plan: In the event that issues persist even after resolving the system errors and re-running the proof, prepare to review the proof step-by-step, ensuring all logical steps are correct and properly justified. However, this step should only be necessary if the proof fails after the system issues are resolved.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on coordinating with system administrators or those responsible for the Isabelle setup to address these technical issues before proceeding with any modifications to the proof itself.\n",
