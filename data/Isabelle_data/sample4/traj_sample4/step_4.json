    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two logical expressions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Prove left-to-right implication (→)\n   - Prove right-to-left implication (←)\n\n3. Left-to-right implication (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on the disjunction:\n     a. Case P: Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n     b. Case (Q ∧ R): Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left implication (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on P:\n     a. If P is true, then P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is immediately true\n     b. If P is false, then Q must be true (from P ∨ Q) and R must be true (from P ∨ R)\n        Show that this implies Q ∧ R, which in turn implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's built-in tactics:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for basic logical steps\n   - Consider using 'auto' for simple logical manipulations\n   - Use 'case_tac' for case analysis\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7. Review and optimize:\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n   - Consider if any steps can be combined or automated further\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The forward direction (=>) of the proof is correct and should be kept as is.\n\n2. For the backward direction (<=), we need to restructure the proof as follows:\n\n   a. Start with the assumption \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\".\n   \n   b. Split this assumption into two parts: \"P ∨ Q\" and \"P ∨ R\".\n   \n   c. Use case analysis on \"P ∨ Q\":\n      - Case 1: Assume P\n        If P is true, we can immediately conclude \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\".\n      \n      - Case 2: Assume Q\n        If Q is true, we need to consider \"P ∨ R\":\n          - If P is true, we can conclude \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\".\n          - If R is true, we can conclude Q ∧ R, and then \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\".\n\n3. Use the following Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'conjE' to split the initial assumption.\n   - Use 'disjE' for case analysis on \"P ∨ Q\" and \"P ∨ R\".\n   - Use 'disjI1' and 'disjI2' to introduce disjunctions.\n   - Use 'conjI' to form \"Q ∧ R\" when necessary.\n\n4. Ensure each step is explicitly justified, avoiding the introduction of unjustified assumptions.\n\n5. Complete the proof with 'qed' after both directions are proven.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof itself appears to be correct, but there are system-level errors preventing the successful execution and verification of the proof.\n\nImprovement: We need to address the underlying system issues, particularly the database access errors, before attempting to re-run or modify the proof.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that the current unsatisfactory result is not due to the proof itself, but rather due to system-level issues. The proof structure and logic seem to be correct and follow the planned approach. However, the Isabelle system is encountering database-related errors that are preventing the successful execution and verification of the proof.\n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. The system administrators or the person responsible for the Isabelle setup should investigate and resolve the database access issues. The errors suggest that the database file has been moved or is set to read-only mode, which is preventing the system from writing necessary information.\n\n2. Once the system issues are resolved, we should re-run the exact same proof without any modifications. Given that the proof structure appears correct, it's likely that it will succeed once the system errors are addressed.\n\n3. If any issues persist after resolving the system errors and re-running the proof, we should then review the proof step-by-step to ensure all logical steps are correct and properly justified.\n\n4. In future attempts, it would be beneficial to ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and all necessary permissions are in place before starting the proof process. This could help avoid similar system-level issues in the future.\n\n5. Consider implementing a system check or diagnostic tool that can verify the Isabelle environment's integrity before beginning complex proofs, to catch and address any potential issues early in the process.\n\nBy addressing these system-level issues first, we can ensure that the proof is being evaluated correctly, and then proceed with any necessary refinements to the proof itself if needed.",
