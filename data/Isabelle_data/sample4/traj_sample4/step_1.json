    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two logical expressions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Prove left-to-right implication (→)\n   - Prove right-to-left implication (←)\n\n3. Left-to-right implication (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on the disjunction:\n     a. Case P: Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n     b. Case (Q ∧ R): Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left implication (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on P:\n     a. If P is true, then P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is immediately true\n     b. If P is false, then Q must be true (from P ∨ Q) and R must be true (from P ∨ R)\n        Show that this implies Q ∧ R, which in turn implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's built-in tactics:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for basic logical steps\n   - Consider using 'auto' for simple logical manipulations\n   - Use 'case_tac' for case analysis\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7. Review and optimize:\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n   - Consider if any steps can be combined or automated further\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The primary issue is the use of Unicode symbols in the theorem statement and proof, which is causing a lexical error. We need to rewrite the theorem and proof using Isabelle-compatible ASCII representations of logical symbols.\n\n2. We should start by rewriting the lemma statement:\n   - Replace ∨ with \\<or>\n   - Replace ∧ with \\<and>\n   - Replace ↔ with \\<longleftrightarrow>\n\n3. After correcting the lemma statement, we need to review and adjust the entire proof, replacing all occurrences of Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents.\n\n4. While making these changes, we should also ensure that:\n   - All quotation marks are ASCII double quotes (\")\n   - The proof structure, indentation, and syntax follow Isabelle's requirements\n\n5. Once these corrections are made, we can attempt to process the proof again. If successful, we can then focus on verifying the logical correctness of each step in the proof.\n\n6. If any further syntax errors occur, we should address them systematically, ensuring each line is compatible with Isabelle's syntax before moving on to the next.\n\n7. After resolving all syntax issues, we can proceed with evaluating the logical structure and completeness of the proof, making any necessary adjustments to ensure it correctly demonstrates the equivalence stated in the lemma.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure uses 'cases' incorrectly for a disjunction, leading to undefined cases.\nImprovement: Replace the 'cases' proof method with a direct proof using 'rule disjE' to handle the disjunction properly.\n```\n\nThe primary issue in the current proof attempt is the misuse of the 'cases' method. When dealing with a disjunction like \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\", we should use 'rule disjE' instead of 'cases'. This allows us to handle both parts of the disjunction correctly.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should restructure it as follows:\n\n1. For the first direction (=>):\n   - Start with \"show ?thesis\" after assuming the left side.\n   - Use \"proof (rule disjE)\" to split the disjunction.\n   - Handle the case where P is true.\n   - Handle the case where Q ∧ R is true.\n\n2. For the second direction (<=):\n   - The structure is mostly correct, but we can simplify it.\n   - Start with \"show ?thesis\" after assuming the right side.\n   - Use \"proof cases\" to consider P being true or false.\n   - For the case where P is false, use the assumption to deduce Q and R directly.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to complete the proof without encountering undefined cases. This approach aligns better with Isabelle's proof methods for handling disjunctions and should lead to a more straightforward and correct proof.",
