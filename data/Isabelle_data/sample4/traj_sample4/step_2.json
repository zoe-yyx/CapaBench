    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence (↔) between two logical expressions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Prove left-to-right implication (→)\n   - Prove right-to-left implication (←)\n\n3. Left-to-right implication (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on the disjunction:\n     a. Case P: Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n     b. Case (Q ∧ R): Show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left implication (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on P:\n     a. If P is true, then P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is immediately true\n     b. If P is false, then Q must be true (from P ∨ Q) and R must be true (from P ∨ R)\n        Show that this implies Q ∧ R, which in turn implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's built-in tactics:\n   - Use 'apply' tactics for basic logical steps\n   - Consider using 'auto' for simple logical manipulations\n   - Use 'case_tac' for case analysis\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\n7. Review and optimize:\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n   - Consider if any steps can be combined or automated further\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo address the undefined case issue and improve the proof structure, we should modify the proof as follows:\n\n1. For the first direction (=>):\n   - After assuming \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\", use \"show ?thesis\" to start proving the right-hand side.\n   - Apply \"proof (rule disjE)\" to properly handle the disjunction.\n   - In the first case, assume P and show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R).\n   - In the second case, assume Q ∧ R and show that it implies both (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R).\n\n2. For the second direction (<=):\n   - The structure is mostly correct, but we can simplify it slightly.\n   - After assuming \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\", use \"show ?thesis\" to start proving P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n   - Use \"proof cases\" to consider when P is true or false.\n   - For the case where P is true, show that it directly implies P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n   - For the case where P is false, use the assumption to deduce Q and R, then show Q ∧ R.\n\nThis approach will properly handle the disjunction in the first direction and maintain the correct structure for the second direction, resolving the undefined case issue and leading to a complete proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but it fails to explicitly show the equivalence between the left and right sides of the theorem.\n\nImprovement: We need to explicitly prove both directions of the equivalence using \"show\" statements for each direction, and ensure that all cases are properly handled with detailed justifications.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. The proof structure is generally correct, but we need to make the bidirectional nature of the equivalence more explicit.\n\n2. For the forward direction (=>):\n   - We should use \"show\" to clearly state that we're proving \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\" from \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\".\n   - In each case of the disjE rule, we need to explicitly show how the assumption leads to both conjuncts of the conclusion.\n\n3. For the backward direction (<=):\n   - We should use \"show\" to clearly state that we're proving \"P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\" from \"(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\".\n   - In the case where ¬P, we need to be more explicit about how we derive Q ∧ R from the assumptions.\n\n4. We should avoid using \"by auto\" or \"by simp\" for crucial steps, instead breaking down the reasoning into more explicit steps that Isabelle can follow.\n\n5. Each major step in the proof should be justified with a clear reason, using \"then\" or \"hence\" to show the logical flow.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to complete the proof successfully and demonstrate the equivalence rigorously.",
