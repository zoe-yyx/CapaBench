    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a lexical error due to the use of Unicode symbols that Isabelle's parser cannot recognize. To resolve this, we need to modify the theorem statement and type declarations to use ASCII equivalents. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Replace Unicode arrows with ASCII equivalents:\n   - Change \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\" to \"'a => 'b => bool\" in the type declaration.\n   - Change \"⟶\" to \"-->\" in the theorem statement.\n\n2. Keep the overall structure of the proof intact, as it appears to be logically sound.\n\n3. After making these changes, attempt to run the proof again. The lexical error should be resolved, allowing Isabelle to parse the input correctly.\n\n4. If the proof goes through after these changes, no further modifications will be needed. However, if new issues arise, we'll need to address them based on the specific error messages or proof state.\n\n5. Pay attention to any other Unicode symbols that might have been overlooked in the initial correction, such as in the assumption H or elsewhere in the proof body.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these syntax corrections while maintaining the logical structure of the existing proof. This should allow us to progress past the current lexical error and potentially complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof timeout suggests that the proof may be overly complex or inefficient for Isabelle to process within the given time limit.\n\nImprovement: Simplify the proof structure by using more direct tactics and leveraging Isabelle's automated reasoning tools to reduce the number of manual steps required.\n```\n\nBased on the timeout error, it appears that while the syntax issues have been resolved, the proof itself may be too complex or inefficient for Isabelle to process within the allotted time. To address this, we should consider the following points:\n\n1. The current proof structure, while logically sound, may be more verbose than necessary. Isabelle often performs better with more concise proofs that leverage its built-in automation.\n\n2. We might be missing opportunities to use Isabelle's powerful automated reasoning tools, which could significantly simplify the proof process.\n\n3. The proof may be taking a more complicated path than necessary to reach the conclusion.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Attempt to use Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto', 'simp', or 'blast' to see if they can solve the problem directly or at least simplify parts of it.\n\n2. If automation doesn't solve the entire problem, try to break down the proof into smaller, more manageable steps that Isabelle can process more quickly.\n\n3. Consider using Isar style proofs with explicit intermediate steps, which can sometimes be more efficient than purely tactical proofs.\n\n4. Examine if we can leverage the assumption H more directly in the proof, possibly avoiding the need for complex case analysis.\n\n5. If possible, try to rewrite the proof in a way that avoids nested proofs, as these can sometimes lead to longer processing times.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing a more streamlined proof approach, starting with attempts at automation and then gradually adding more explicit steps only if necessary. This should help in avoiding timeouts and potentially lead to a successful proof completion.",
