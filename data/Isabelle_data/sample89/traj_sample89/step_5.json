    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is due to the use of Unicode symbols in the theorem statement and proof, which are not being correctly interpreted by the Isabelle environment. To resolve this issue and proceed with the proof, we need to rewrite the entire theorem and proof using ASCII equivalents for all special symbols. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the theorem statement:\n   - Replace \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\" with \"'a => 'b => bool\"\n   - Replace \"∀\" with \"!!\"\n   - Replace \"¬\" with \"~\"\n   - Replace \"∨\" with \"|\"\n   - Replace \"⟶\" with \"-->\"\n\n2. Rewrite the proof:\n   - Replace all remaining Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents throughout the proof\n\n3. Once the rewriting is complete, attempt to run the proof again from the beginning\n\n4. If any errors persist, they will likely be related to the logical structure of the proof rather than syntax issues, allowing us to focus on the proof's content\n\n5. After successfully running the proof with ASCII symbols, we can consider whether to keep this format or investigate ways to enable Unicode support in the Isabelle environment for future proofs\n\nThis approach should resolve the current lexical error and allow us to proceed with verifying the logical correctness of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt fails due to a mismatch between the ASCII symbols used in the theorem statement and the Unicode symbols interpreted by Isabelle.\n\nImprovement: Rewrite the theorem statement and proof using Isabelle's native syntax, avoiding both ASCII and Unicode special symbols, and instead use Isabelle's built-in logical connectives and quantifiers.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. We should use Isabelle's native syntax for logical connectives and quantifiers. For example:\n   - Use \"ALL\" instead of \"!!\" for universal quantification\n   - Use \"~\" for negation (this is correct already)\n   - Use \"|\" for disjunction (this is correct already)\n   - Use \"longrightarrow\" or \"==>\" instead of \"-->\" for implication\n\n2. The theorem statement should be reformulated using these native syntax elements. This will ensure that Isabelle correctly interprets the logical structure of the theorem.\n\n3. The proof structure seems logically sound, but it needs to be adjusted to use the correct Isabelle syntax as well. This includes using the correct names for inference rules and tactics.\n\n4. We should verify that all proof steps are using the correct Isabelle commands and tactics. For example, ensure that \"rule\" applications are correct and that assumptions are referenced properly.\n\n5. After making these changes, we should attempt to run the proof again, paying close attention to any error messages or proof state information provided by Isabelle to guide further refinements if needed.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to resolve the current syntax issues and focus on the logical aspects of the proof, if any further issues arise.",
