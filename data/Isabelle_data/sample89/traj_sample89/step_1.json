    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the current state of the proof and disregarding the technical error, we should proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced universal quantifiers for 'a' and 'b' using the 'allI' rule.\n2. Our current goal is of the form \"P a b ⟶ Q a b\" for arbitrary 'a' and 'b'.\n3. The next logical step is to apply the 'impI' rule to handle the implication.\n\nApplying 'impI' will transform our goal as follows:\n- Current goal: \"P a b ⟶ Q a b\"\n- After 'impI': \n  Assumption: \"P a b\"\n  Goal: \"Q a b\"\n\nThis transformation allows us to assume P a b and focus on proving Q a b, which aligns perfectly with our given assumption H: \"∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\".\n\nAfter applying 'impI', we should focus on using the assumption H along with our new assumption P a b to prove Q a b. This will likely involve:\n1. Instantiating the universal quantifiers in H with our specific 'a' and 'b'.\n2. Using classical reasoning to handle the disjunction in the instantiated H.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed by applying the 'impI' rule as the next step in the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type declaration, specifically with the arrow symbols used for function types.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbols \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"⟹\" in the type declaration for P and Q.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt is on the right track in terms of its logical structure, but it's being hindered by a syntax error. The error message indicates that there's an issue with parsing the type declaration for P and Q. \n\nIn Isabelle, function types are typically denoted using the symbol \"⟹\" (double right arrow), not \"⇒\" (single right arrow). This small but crucial difference is causing the lexical error.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Correct the type declaration in the lemma statement. It should read:\n   `fixes P Q :: \"'a ⟹ 'b ⟹ bool\"`\n\n2. Make sure all other occurrences of \"⇒\" are replaced with \"⟹\" if they are meant to represent function types.\n\n3. After fixing this syntax issue, proceed with the proof as outlined in the current thought. The logical structure of applying (rule allI)+ followed by (rule impI) is correct and should be maintained.\n\n4. Pay close attention to other potential syntax issues, ensuring that all Isabelle-specific symbols are correctly used.\n\nBy addressing this syntax error, we should be able to proceed with the proof without encountering further lexical issues, allowing us to focus on the logical aspects of the proof.",
