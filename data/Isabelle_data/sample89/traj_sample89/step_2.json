    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and the reflection provided, here's the reasoning to guide the next proving operation:\n\n1. The primary issue is a syntax error in the type declaration. We need to correct this before proceeding with the logical proof.\n\n2. The correct type declaration should use the Isabelle-specific arrow symbol \"⟹\" instead of \"⇒\" for function types.\n\n3. After correcting the syntax, we can proceed with the proof strategy as originally planned.\n\n4. The current proof structure is correct, using (rule allI)+ to introduce universal quantifiers and (rule impI) to handle the implication.\n\n5. Once the syntax is fixed, we should focus on applying the assumption H to our specific 'a' and 'b', which will give us the disjunction ¬P a b ∨ Q a b.\n\n6. We'll then need to use case distinction on this disjunction to complete the proof.\n\n7. For the case ¬P a b, we'll use contradiction with our assumption P a b.\n\n8. For the case Q a b, we can directly use this to prove our goal.\n\nThe acting agent should start by correcting the syntax in the lemma statement, then proceed with the proof as outlined. Pay careful attention to any other potential syntax issues, especially when using Isabelle-specific symbols or commands.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is using Unicode arrows (⇒) instead of Isabelle-specific arrows (⟹) in the type declaration, causing a lexical error.\nImprovement: Replace all instances of the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the Isabelle-specific arrow (⟹) in the type declaration for P and Q.\n```\n\nThe main issue causing the unsatisfactory result is a syntax error in the type declaration. The proof is using Unicode arrows (⇒) instead of the Isabelle-specific arrows (⟹) for function types, which Isabelle's parser cannot recognize.\n\nTo improve the outcome, we need to adjust our action step by replacing all instances of the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the Isabelle-specific arrow (⟹) in the type declaration for P and Q. This should resolve the lexical error and allow the proof to proceed.\n\nIt's important to note that while the overall proof structure appears correct, we cannot verify its validity until we resolve this syntax issue. Once the type declaration is corrected, we should be able to proceed with the proof as outlined in the current thought.\n\nFor future actions, we should pay extra attention to Isabelle-specific syntax, especially when it comes to symbols that may look similar but have different meanings in Isabelle compared to standard mathematical notation. This includes not just arrows, but also other logical symbols and quantifiers.\n\nAdditionally, we should consider using Isabelle's pretty-printing features or IDE support when available, as these can help catch such syntax issues early in the proof development process.",
