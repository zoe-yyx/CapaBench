    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Environment Troubleshooting:\n   The SQLite error suggests an issue with the Isabelle environment rather than the proof itself. Before proceeding with the proof, we need to address this technical problem.\n\n2. Proof Preservation:\n   The current proof structure appears correct and follows our planned strategy. We should preserve this proof exactly as it is.\n\n3. Session Management:\n   Recommend restarting the Isabelle session to clear any potential state issues or corrupted connections.\n\n4. Verification Process:\n   Once the environment is stable, we should re-run the entire proof from the beginning to ensure it executes without errors.\n\n5. Error Monitoring:\n   Pay close attention to any new error messages or warnings that may appear during the re-execution of the proof.\n\n6. Fallback Strategy:\n   If the error persists after a session restart, consider breaking down the proof into smaller steps and executing them individually to isolate any potential issues.\n\n7. Syntax Confirmation:\n   Although the proof looks correct, double-check all Unicode characters and Isabelle-specific operators to ensure they're correctly interpreted by the system.\n\n8. Next Action:\n   The acting agent should focus on resolving the environment issue first. Once resolved, re-run the existing proof without changes. Only if new errors appear should we consider modifying the proof structure.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof contains Unicode characters that are not being correctly interpreted by the Isabelle environment, causing a lexical error.\n\nImprovement: Replace all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents in the proof to ensure compatibility with the current Isabelle setup.\n```\n\nThis reflection is based on the following analysis:\n\n1. The error message indicates a lexical error at the type declaration, specifically with the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\".\n\n2. While the proof structure and logic appear correct, the use of Unicode symbols is causing issues with the Isabelle parser.\n\n3. The environment troubleshooting suggested earlier did not resolve the issue, indicating that the problem lies within the proof text itself rather than the Isabelle setup.\n\n4. To improve the situation, we should replace all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents. For example:\n   - Replace \"⇒\" with \"=>\"\n   - Replace \"∀\" with \"!!\"\n   - Replace \"¬\" with \"~\"\n   - Replace \"∨\" with \"|\"\n   - Replace \"⟶\" with \"-->\"\n\n5. By using ASCII symbols, we can ensure better compatibility across different Isabelle environments and avoid potential parsing issues.\n\n6. Once these changes are made, the proof should be re-run in its entirety to verify that it executes without errors.\n\n7. If successful, this approach will allow us to focus on the logical aspects of the proof without being hindered by syntax-related issues.\n\n8. For future proofs, we should consider using ASCII symbols by default unless we are certain that the environment fully supports Unicode input.\n\nThis reflection provides a clear path forward to resolve the current issue and improve the robustness of our proof writing process.",
