    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo address the syntax issues and properly set up the proof in Isabelle, we should:\n\n1. Rewrite the theorem statement using Isabelle's native syntax:\n   - Replace \"!!\" with \"ALL\" for universal quantification\n   - Keep \"~\" for negation and \"|\" for disjunction as they are correct\n   - Replace \"-->\" with \"longrightarrow\" for implication\n\n2. Start the proof using the correct Isabelle proof commands:\n   - Begin with \"proof -\" to start a new proof block\n   - Use \"fix a b\" to introduce arbitrary variables\n   - Use \"assume\" to introduce the assumption from H\n   - Use \"show\" to state the goal we need to prove\n\n3. Structure the proof using Isar style, which is more readable and maintainable in Isabelle:\n   - Use \"have\" statements to derive intermediate results\n   - Use \"thus\" or \"then show\" to connect derived results to the goal\n\n4. Apply appropriate Isabelle tactics and rules:\n   - Use \"rule\" applications where needed, such as \"rule disjE\" for case distinction\n   - Use \"contradiction\" and \"assumption\" tactics as in the original proof attempt\n\n5. Ensure all proof steps are properly closed and indented\n\nThis approach should resolve the syntax issues and allow Isabelle to process the proof correctly. If any further issues arise, we can address them based on the specific error messages or proof state information provided by Isabelle.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt used Unicode symbols for arrows (⇒, ⟶) which are not recognized by Isabelle's parser, causing lexical errors.\n\nImprovement: Replace Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents (=> for ⇒, --> for ⟶) in type declarations and logical statements to ensure Isabelle can parse the input correctly.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the main issue causing the unsatisfactory result is the use of Unicode symbols that Isabelle's parser cannot handle. The improvement suggests a concrete action to resolve this issue by using ASCII equivalents that Isabelle recognizes.\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. In the type declaration, replace \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\" with \"'a => 'b => bool\".\n2. In the theorem statement, replace \"⟶\" with \"-->\".\n\nThese changes should allow Isabelle to parse the input without lexical errors. The overall structure of the proof appears to be correct, so once these syntax issues are resolved, the proof should be able to proceed. If any further issues arise after making these changes, we can address them in subsequent iterations of the proof process.",
