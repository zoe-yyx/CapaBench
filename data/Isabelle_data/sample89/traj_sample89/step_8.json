    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the original problem, here's the reasoning to guide the next proving operation:\n\n1. Start with a more direct approach using Isabelle's automated reasoning tools. The theorem statement is relatively straightforward, and there's a good chance that Isabelle's automation can handle it.\n\n2. Begin by applying the 'auto' method, which combines simplification and classical reasoning. This might solve the entire problem in one step.\n\n3. If 'auto' doesn't completely solve the problem, we can try to guide it with the assumption H. We can do this by using the 'using' keyword to explicitly tell Isabelle to use the assumption.\n\n4. If automation doesn't fully succeed, we should then break down the proof into smaller steps. Start by introducing arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b', then focus on proving the implication for these specific variables.\n\n5. Use the assumption H more directly. Instead of doing a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b, try to use it to directly prove P a b ⟶ Q a b.\n\n6. Avoid nested proofs if possible, as they can be more time-consuming for Isabelle to process.\n\n7. If steps are needed, make them explicit using Isar style proof language, which can sometimes be more efficient than purely tactical proofs.\n\nThe acting agent should start with the simplest approach and gradually add complexity only if necessary. This strategy should help avoid timeouts and lead to a successful proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type declaration, specifically with the arrow symbols used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbols (⇒) with the correct Isabelle syntax (=>), and ensure all special symbols are properly encoded or replaced with their ASCII equivalents.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the primary issue was not in the reasoning or proof strategy, but in the syntax used in the theorem statement. The use of Unicode arrows (⇒) instead of the standard Isabelle ASCII arrows (=>) caused a lexical error.\n\nFor future actions, we should:\n\n1. Double-check all special symbols and ensure they are compatible with Isabelle's syntax.\n2. Use ASCII equivalents when possible to avoid encoding issues.\n3. Pay close attention to error messages, as they often pinpoint the exact location and nature of the problem.\n4. Consider using Isabelle's IDE (Isabelle/jEdit) which can help catch these syntax errors early.\n\nThe core strategy for proving the theorem remains sound, but we need to correct the syntax before we can proceed with the proof. Once the syntax is fixed, the automated proof using 'by auto' should be attempted again, as it's likely to succeed for this relatively straightforward theorem.",
