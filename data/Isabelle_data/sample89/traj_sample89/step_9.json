    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a syntax error in the type declaration of our theorem. Specifically, the Unicode arrows (⇒) used in the type declaration are causing a lexical error. To resolve this and proceed with our proof, we need to:\n\n1. Correct the syntax in the type declaration:\n   - Replace all instances of ⇒ with => in the type declaration.\n   - Ensure all other special symbols are properly encoded or replaced with their ASCII equivalents.\n\n2. Once the syntax is corrected, we should attempt the automated proof again using 'by auto'. The theorem is straightforward enough that the automated prover should be able to handle it.\n\n3. If the automated proof fails after fixing the syntax, we should then proceed with the step-by-step proof outline as described in our original plan.\n\nThe key here is to first ensure our theorem is correctly stated in Isabelle's syntax before attempting any proof steps. This will allow us to focus on the logical aspects of the proof rather than getting stuck on syntax issues.\n",
