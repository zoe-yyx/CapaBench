    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem logic_ex9:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ 'b ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   - We are given the assumption H: ∀a b. ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the goal: ∀a b. P a b ⟶ Q a b\n   b. Use the 'allI' rule twice to introduce arbitrary variables for 'a' and 'b'\n   c. Use the 'impI' rule to transform the implication into an assumption and goal\n   d. Apply the assumption H to obtain ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for our specific 'a' and 'b'\n   e. Use a case distinction on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b\n   f. For the case ¬P a b:\n      - This contradicts our assumption P a b, so we can derive anything (including Q a b)\n   g. For the case Q a b:\n      - This directly proves our goal\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   - apply (rule allI)+  -- Introduce universal quantifiers\n   - apply (rule impI)   -- Transform implication\n   - apply (drule_tac x=a in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'a'\n   - apply (drule_tac x=b in spec)  -- Instantiate H with 'b'\n   - apply (erule disjE)  -- Case distinction\n   - apply contradiction  -- Handle ¬P a b case\n   - apply assumption     -- Handle Q a b case\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof successfully concludes\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the logical equivalence between ¬P ∨ Q and P ⟶ Q\n   - It showcases the use of universal quantification, implication, and disjunction in formal logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe main issue we're facing is a syntax error in the type declaration for predicates P and Q. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we need to:\n\n1. Replace the Unicode arrows (⇒) with Isabelle-specific arrows (⟹) in the type declaration.\n2. Ensure that all other parts of the proof use Isabelle-specific syntax correctly.\n\nThe corrected type declaration should look like this:\n  fixes P Q :: \"'a ⟹ 'b ⟹ bool\"\n\nOnce this syntax error is corrected, we should be able to proceed with the proof as originally planned. The proof structure itself appears to be correct, following the strategy outlined in the planning phase.\n\nAfter making this correction, we should:\n1. Verify that the lexical error has been resolved.\n2. Check if any other syntax errors are revealed.\n3. If no further errors are present, proceed with the proof steps as outlined in the original plan.\n\nIt's crucial to pay attention to Isabelle-specific syntax throughout the proof to avoid similar issues in the future steps.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof appears to be correct, but there's an issue with the Isabelle environment or database that's preventing successful execution.\n\nImprovement: We need to investigate and resolve the SQLite error, possibly by ensuring proper initialization of the Isabelle environment and checking for any database connectivity issues before proceeding with the proof.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that while our proof structure and syntax appear to be correct, we're encountering an unexpected error related to the Isabelle environment or its underlying database. This error is preventing us from successfully executing and verifying our proof.\n\nTo move forward effectively:\n\n1. Environment Check: We should verify that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and all necessary components are correctly initialized.\n\n2. Database Connectivity: The SQLite error suggests there might be an issue with database connectivity or transaction management. We need to ensure that the Isabelle session is properly connected to its required databases.\n\n3. Session Restart: It might be beneficial to try restarting the Isabelle session to reset any potentially corrupted states or connections.\n\n4. Error Logging: If the issue persists, we should look for more detailed error logs that might provide additional context about the SQLite error.\n\n5. Proof Verification: Once the environment issues are resolved, we should re-run our proof to ensure it executes without errors and successfully proves the theorem.\n\n6. Syntax Double-Check: Although the proof looks correct, it's worth double-checking all syntax, especially the use of Unicode characters and Isabelle-specific operators, to ensure they're all correctly interpreted.\n\nBy addressing these points, we aim to create a stable environment for executing our proof and verifying the theorem. The proof itself appears sound, so our focus should be on resolving the technical issues preventing its successful execution.",
