    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem sum_of_sqr2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two integers x and y, x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy.\n   - This is a well-known inequality, often referred to as the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality for two numbers.\n\n2. Prepare the proof strategy:\n   - We can prove this by showing that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 for all integers x and y.\n   - Expanding (x - y)^2 will lead us to the desired inequality.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the statement (x - y)^2 ≥ 0\n   b) Expand (x - y)^2\n   c) Simplify and rearrange terms\n   d) Arrive at the desired inequality\n\n4. Consider potential Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'have' statements to introduce intermediate steps\n   - Utilize 'algebra' tactic for algebraic manipulations\n   - Apply 'simp' for simplification where needed\n\n5. Plan for potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to handle integer-specific properties if necessary\n   - Consider using additional lemmas if the basic algebraic manipulation is not sufficient\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the final step clearly shows x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy\n\n7. Verify and refine:\n   - After implementing the proof, check for any gaps or unclear steps\n   - Refine the proof if needed for clarity or conciseness\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe immediate issue we need to address is the use of Unicode characters in the proof, specifically the '≥' symbol. This is causing a lexical error that prevents Isabelle from parsing the theorem statement and subsequent proof steps. To resolve this:\n\n1. Replace all instances of '≥' with '>=' in the theorem statement and throughout the proof.\n2. Double-check that all other mathematical operators and symbols are using standard ASCII characters.\n3. Ensure that the proof structure remains intact after making these changes.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on rewriting the theorem statement and each step of the proof, replacing '≥' with '>='. This should be done carefully to maintain the logical flow and correctness of the proof.\n\nAfter making these changes, the theorem statement should look like:\n\nlemma sum_of_sqr2: \"x * x + y * y >= 2 * x * y\" for x y :: int\n\nAnd similarly, all occurrences of '≥' in the proof steps should be replaced with '>='.\n\nOnce these changes are made, the lexical error should be resolved, allowing Isabelle to properly parse and process the proof. This will enable us to move forward with verifying the logical correctness of the proof itself.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof step attempting to simplify (x - y) * (x - y) using algebra is failing, likely due to insufficient automation or missing lemmas.\n\nImprovement: Break down the algebraic expansion step-by-step, using more basic algebraic rules or introducing intermediate steps to guide Isabelle through the expansion process.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The current issue stems from the proof step that tries to expand (x - y) * (x - y) into x * x - 2 * x * y + y * y. Isabelle is unable to automatically perform this expansion using just the 'algebra' simplification set.\n\n2. The effectiveness of using a single 'by (simp add: algebra)' command for this complex algebraic manipulation was overestimated. This approach assumes too much about Isabelle's automatic simplification capabilities.\n\n3. To improve the proof, we should break down the algebraic expansion into smaller, more manageable steps. This could involve:\n   - Expanding (x - y) * (x - y) using the distributive property\n   - Simplifying the resulting terms step-by-step\n   - Possibly introducing intermediate equalities to guide Isabelle through the process\n\n4. By providing a more detailed, step-by-step expansion, we align better with the overall goal of proving the theorem successfully, as it gives Isabelle clearer instructions to follow.\n\n5. The use of 'sorry' is not present in the current proof attempt, which is good. We should continue to avoid it and focus on completing each step rigorously.\n\nFor the next round, the reasoning agent should focus on breaking down the algebraic expansion of (x - y) * (x - y) into smaller, more explicit steps. The acting agent should then implement these steps in the Isabelle proof, possibly using multiple 'have' statements to guide Isabelle through the expansion process.",
