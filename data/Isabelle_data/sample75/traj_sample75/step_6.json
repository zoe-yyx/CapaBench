    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem sum_of_sqr2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two integers x and y, x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy.\n   - This is a well-known inequality, often referred to as the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality for two numbers.\n\n2. Prepare the proof strategy:\n   - We can prove this by showing that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 for all integers x and y.\n   - Expanding (x - y)^2 will lead us to the desired inequality.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the statement (x - y)^2 ≥ 0\n   b) Expand (x - y)^2\n   c) Simplify and rearrange terms\n   d) Arrive at the desired inequality\n\n4. Consider potential Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'have' statements to introduce intermediate steps\n   - Utilize 'algebra' tactic for algebraic manipulations\n   - Apply 'simp' for simplification where needed\n\n5. Plan for potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to handle integer-specific properties if necessary\n   - Consider using additional lemmas if the basic algebraic manipulation is not sufficient\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the final step clearly shows x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy\n\n7. Verify and refine:\n   - After implementing the proof, check for any gaps or unclear steps\n   - Refine the proof if needed for clarity or conciseness\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof strategy is logically sound, but we've encountered a syntax error due to the use of the non-ASCII \"≥\" symbol. To proceed with the proof, we need to:\n\n1. Replace all instances of \"≥\" with \">=\" in the theorem statement and throughout the proof.\n2. Maintain the existing logical structure of the proof, as it appears to be correct.\n3. After making these replacements, attempt to run the proof again.\n\nThe acting agent should start by modifying the theorem statement:\n\nlemma sum_of_sqr2: \"x * x + y * y >= 2 * x * y\" for x y :: int\n\nThen, proceed through the proof, replacing any remaining \"≥\" symbols with \">=\". The overall structure and steps of the proof should remain the same, as they are logically correct.\n\nOnce these changes are made, the proof should be accepted by Isabelle without parsing errors. If successful, we can then evaluate if any further optimizations or simplifications to the proof steps are necessary.\n\nRemember to use Isabelle-compatible syntax in future proofs to avoid similar issues.\n",
