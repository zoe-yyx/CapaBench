    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem sum_of_sqr2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two integers x and y, x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy.\n   - This is a well-known inequality, often referred to as the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality for two numbers.\n\n2. Prepare the proof strategy:\n   - We can prove this by showing that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 for all integers x and y.\n   - Expanding (x - y)^2 will lead us to the desired inequality.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the statement (x - y)^2 ≥ 0\n   b) Expand (x - y)^2\n   c) Simplify and rearrange terms\n   d) Arrive at the desired inequality\n\n4. Consider potential Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'have' statements to introduce intermediate steps\n   - Utilize 'algebra' tactic for algebraic manipulations\n   - Apply 'simp' for simplification where needed\n\n5. Plan for potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to handle integer-specific properties if necessary\n   - Consider using additional lemmas if the basic algebraic manipulation is not sufficient\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the final step clearly shows x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy\n\n7. Verify and refine:\n   - After implementing the proof, check for any gaps or unclear steps\n   - Refine the proof if needed for clarity or conciseness\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the system-level error we encountered, our primary focus should be on resolving the Isabelle environment issues before proceeding with the proof. However, assuming the environment issues are resolved, we can consider the following reasoning for the next steps in our proof:\n\n1. The overall structure of the proof appears sound. We started with the key insight that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0, which is a good foundation for proving the inequality.\n\n2. The step-by-step expansion of (x - y)^2 is a clear and methodical approach. This breakdown helps in following the algebraic manipulations and ensures we don't miss any steps.\n\n3. The use of 'have' statements for each step, followed by algebraic simplifications, is an effective way to construct the proof in Isabelle.\n\n4. Once we reach the expanded form x^2 - 2xy + y^2 ≥ 0, we're essentially at our goal. The final step of rearranging this to x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy is straightforward.\n\n5. The proof structure seems complete, covering all necessary steps from the initial statement to the final theorem.\n\nFor the next action, assuming the environment issues are resolved:\n\n1. We should attempt to run the proof as it is currently written. The logical structure appears correct, so it may prove successful once the system is functioning properly.\n\n2. If any issues arise in specific steps, we should focus on those particular lines, possibly breaking them down further or providing more explicit justifications.\n\n3. Pay special attention to the transitions between steps, ensuring that Isabelle can follow our reasoning at each point.\n\n4. If the proof succeeds, we might consider if there are any opportunities to make it more concise without losing clarity, though the current level of detail is good for understanding.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is logically sound, but there is a syntactic error in the theorem statement due to the use of the non-ASCII character \"≥\" instead of the Isabelle-specific \">=\".\n\nImprovement: Replace the \"≥\" symbol with \">=\" in the theorem statement and throughout the proof to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's syntax, while maintaining the logical structure of the existing proof.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that our proof strategy is on the right track, but we need to address a fundamental syntax issue. The use of the Unicode greater-than-or-equal-to symbol (≥) is causing Isabelle to fail in parsing the theorem statement. \n\nTo improve our approach:\n\n1. We should carefully review and replace all instances of \"≥\" with \">=\" throughout the proof.\n2. It's important to remember that Isabelle often requires ASCII representations of mathematical symbols.\n3. After making these replacements, we should attempt to run the proof again.\n4. If successful, we can then focus on optimizing or refining the proof steps if necessary.\n5. For future proofs, we should be mindful of using Isabelle-compatible syntax from the start to avoid similar issues.\n\nThis adjustment should allow Isabelle to parse the theorem correctly while maintaining the logical integrity of our proof. Once this syntactic issue is resolved, we can expect the proof to proceed as intended, given that the logical structure appears sound.",
