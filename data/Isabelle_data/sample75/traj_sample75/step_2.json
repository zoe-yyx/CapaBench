    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem sum_of_sqr2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two integers x and y, x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy.\n   - This is a well-known inequality, often referred to as the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality for two numbers.\n\n2. Prepare the proof strategy:\n   - We can prove this by showing that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 for all integers x and y.\n   - Expanding (x - y)^2 will lead us to the desired inequality.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the statement (x - y)^2 ≥ 0\n   b) Expand (x - y)^2\n   c) Simplify and rearrange terms\n   d) Arrive at the desired inequality\n\n4. Consider potential Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'have' statements to introduce intermediate steps\n   - Utilize 'algebra' tactic for algebraic manipulations\n   - Apply 'simp' for simplification where needed\n\n5. Plan for potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to handle integer-specific properties if necessary\n   - Consider using additional lemmas if the basic algebraic manipulation is not sufficient\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the final step clearly shows x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy\n\n7. Verify and refine:\n   - After implementing the proof, check for any gaps or unclear steps\n   - Refine the proof if needed for clarity or conciseness\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is correct, but we need to adjust the notation to match the theorem statement exactly. We should rewrite the proof using multiplication (\"*\") instead of power (\"^2\") for squaring. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start with \"(x - y) * (x - y) >= 0\" instead of \"(x - y)^2 >= 0\".\n2. Expand \"(x - y) * (x - y)\" manually to \"x * x - 2 * x * y + y * y\".\n3. Use algebraic manipulation to rearrange the terms to match the form in the theorem.\n4. Ensure each step uses the exact form \"x * x + y * y\" as in the theorem statement.\n5. Use 'simp' and 'algebra' tactics where appropriate to handle the algebraic steps.\n6. Verify that each step logically follows from the previous one and aligns with the theorem statement.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to prove the theorem using notation that exactly matches the statement, which should resolve the issue with the final proof step.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof uses Unicode characters (≥) which are not compatible with Isabelle's default ASCII-based input.\nImprovement: Replace all Unicode characters with their ASCII equivalents, specifically changing '≥' to '>=' throughout the proof.\n```\n\nThe key issue here is the use of Unicode characters, which Isabelle's default parser is not set up to handle. This is causing a lexical error that prevents the proof from even being parsed, let alone evaluated.\n\nTo address this, we need to rewrite all instances of '≥' as '>=' in both the theorem statement and the proof steps. This will ensure that Isabelle can correctly parse and process the proof.\n\nAdditionally, while the proof structure seems correct, we should double-check that all other symbols and operators are using standard ASCII characters. For example, ensure that multiplication is represented by '*' and not any other symbol.\n\nIn future steps, we should be mindful to use only ASCII characters in our Isabelle proofs unless we're certain that Unicode support has been explicitly enabled. This will help avoid similar parsing errors and ensure our proofs are more widely compatible with different Isabelle setups.",
