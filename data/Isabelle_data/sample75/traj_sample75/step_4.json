    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem sum_of_sqr2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two integers x and y, x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy.\n   - This is a well-known inequality, often referred to as the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality for two numbers.\n\n2. Prepare the proof strategy:\n   - We can prove this by showing that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 for all integers x and y.\n   - Expanding (x - y)^2 will lead us to the desired inequality.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the statement (x - y)^2 ≥ 0\n   b) Expand (x - y)^2\n   c) Simplify and rearrange terms\n   d) Arrive at the desired inequality\n\n4. Consider potential Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'have' statements to introduce intermediate steps\n   - Utilize 'algebra' tactic for algebraic manipulations\n   - Apply 'simp' for simplification where needed\n\n5. Plan for potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to handle integer-specific properties if necessary\n   - Consider using additional lemmas if the basic algebraic manipulation is not sufficient\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the final step clearly shows x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy\n\n7. Verify and refine:\n   - After implementing the proof, check for any gaps or unclear steps\n   - Refine the proof if needed for clarity or conciseness\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo address the issue with expanding (x - y) * (x - y), we need to break down the algebraic expansion into smaller, more explicit steps. This will help Isabelle follow the proof more easily. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start by expanding (x - y) * (x - y) using the distributive property:\n   (x - y) * (x - y) = x * (x - y) - y * (x - y)\n\n2. Further expand the right-hand side:\n   x * (x - y) - y * (x - y) = x * x - x * y - (y * x - y * y)\n\n3. Simplify the expression:\n   x * x - x * y - (y * x - y * y) = x * x - x * y - y * x + y * y\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   x * x - x * y - y * x + y * y = x * x - 2 * x * y + y * y\n\nBy breaking down the expansion into these steps, we provide Isabelle with a clear path to follow. Each step should be introduced using a 'have' statement, followed by appropriate simplification tactics. This approach should allow Isabelle to verify each step of the expansion, ultimately arriving at the desired form: x * x - 2 * x * y + y * y.\n\nAfter successfully expanding and simplifying (x - y) * (x - y), the proof can continue as originally planned, showing that this expression is greater than or equal to zero, which will lead to the final inequality we want to prove.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a system-level issue rather than a flaw in the proof logic.\nImprovement: We need to ensure the Isabelle environment is properly set up and functioning before attempting to prove the theorem again.\n```\n\nThis reflection is based on the following observations:\n\n1. The proof structure and steps appear to be logically sound and well-reasoned. The approach of breaking down the expansion of (x - y) * (x - y) into smaller, more explicit steps was a good strategy.\n\n2. The failure occurred at the session startup level, with error messages indicating issues with the Isabelle/HOL environment rather than with the proof itself.\n\n3. The error suggests problems with executing PolyML, which is the underlying implementation language for Isabelle.\n\nGiven these observations, the next steps should focus on troubleshooting the Isabelle environment:\n\n1. Verify that Isabelle is correctly installed and all necessary components are present.\n2. Check system requirements and ensure they are met (e.g., sufficient memory, correct version of PolyML).\n3. Try restarting the Isabelle environment or the entire system.\n4. If the issue persists, consider reinstalling Isabelle or seeking help from Isabelle community forums.\n\nOnce the environment issues are resolved, we can return to the proof attempt. The current proof structure seems promising, so we should be able to proceed with the same logical steps once the system is functioning correctly.",
