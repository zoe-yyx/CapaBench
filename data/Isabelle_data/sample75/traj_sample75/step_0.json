    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem sum_of_sqr2: \"x * x + y * y ≥ 2 * x * y\" for integers x and y, we should follow the plan of expanding (x - y)^2 ≥ 0. This approach is effective because it directly leads to the desired inequality.\n\nReasoning steps:\n\n1. Start by stating that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 for all integers x and y. This is a fundamental property of squared real numbers.\n\n2. Expand (x - y)^2 algebraically: \n   (x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2\n\n3. Since we know (x - y)^2 ≥ 0, we can state:\n   x^2 - 2xy + y^2 ≥ 0\n\n4. Rearrange the terms to match our target inequality:\n   x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy\n\nThis reasoning provides a clear path to prove the theorem. The acting agent should start by introducing the statement (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 and then follow these algebraic steps. The 'have' tactic can be used to introduce each step, and the 'algebra' tactic might be helpful for the algebraic manipulations.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof fails due to a lexical error with the \"≥\" symbol, indicating a potential encoding or input issue.\n\nImprovement: Replace the \"≥\" symbol with its ASCII equivalent \">=\" to ensure compatibility and correct parsing of the theorem statement.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the main issue is not with the logical reasoning or proof structure, but rather with the syntax of the theorem statement itself. The use of the unicode symbol \"≥\" has caused a lexical error, preventing Isabelle from parsing the proposition correctly.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The planning agent should be aware of potential encoding issues and stick to ASCII representations of mathematical symbols when stating theorems and lemmas.\n\n2. The reasoning agent should continue with the current logical approach, as it seems sound. The proof strategy of expanding (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 is valid and appropriate for this theorem.\n\n3. The acting agent should modify the theorem statement to use \">=\" instead of \"≥\". After making this change, they should attempt to implement the proof as previously outlined.\n\n4. All agents should be mindful of using ASCII equivalents for mathematical symbols (e.g., \">=\" for \"≥\", \"<=\" for \"≤\", etc.) to avoid similar parsing issues in the future.\n\n5. If the proof proceeds successfully after this change, the agents should focus on ensuring that each step is rigorously justified using appropriate Isabelle tactics and methods.\n\nThis reflection aims to address the immediate syntactic issue while maintaining the sound logical approach developed in the previous steps. By making this adjustment, the team should be able to move forward with proving the theorem successfully.",
