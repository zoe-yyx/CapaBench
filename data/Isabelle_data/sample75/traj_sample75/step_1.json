    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem sum_of_sqr2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two integers x and y, x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy.\n   - This is a well-known inequality, often referred to as the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality for two numbers.\n\n2. Prepare the proof strategy:\n   - We can prove this by showing that (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 for all integers x and y.\n   - Expanding (x - y)^2 will lead us to the desired inequality.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the statement (x - y)^2 ≥ 0\n   b) Expand (x - y)^2\n   c) Simplify and rearrange terms\n   d) Arrive at the desired inequality\n\n4. Consider potential Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'have' statements to introduce intermediate steps\n   - Utilize 'algebra' tactic for algebraic manipulations\n   - Apply 'simp' for simplification where needed\n\n5. Plan for potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to handle integer-specific properties if necessary\n   - Consider using additional lemmas if the basic algebraic manipulation is not sufficient\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the final step clearly shows x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy\n\n7. Verify and refine:\n   - After implementing the proof, check for any gaps or unclear steps\n   - Refine the proof if needed for clarity or conciseness\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Theorem Statement Correction:\n   The first step is to correct the theorem statement by replacing the \"≥\" symbol with its ASCII equivalent \">=\". This should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to parse the proposition correctly.\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   The overall proof structure outlined in the planning phase remains valid. We should proceed with the strategy of proving (x - y)^2 ≥ 0 and then expanding it to reach the desired inequality.\n\n3. Step-by-Step Approach:\n   a) Start by stating (x - y)^2 >= 0 for all integers x and y.\n   b) Expand (x - y)^2 using the power2_diff lemma.\n   c) Simplify and rearrange the terms to reach x^2 + y^2 >= 2*x*y.\n\n4. Isabelle Tactics:\n   - Use 'have' statements to introduce each step of the proof.\n   - Apply the 'simp' tactic for basic simplifications.\n   - Utilize the 'algebra' tactic for more complex algebraic manipulations if needed.\n\n5. Justification:\n   Ensure each step is properly justified. The initial statement (x - y)^2 >= 0 can be justified by the fact that squares of real numbers (including integers) are always non-negative.\n\n6. Final Step:\n   Conclude the proof by showing how the expanded and simplified inequality directly proves the theorem statement.\n\n7. Verification:\n   After implementing the proof, verify that each step logically follows from the previous one and that the final step indeed proves the theorem statement.\n\nThis reasoning aims to guide the acting agent in implementing a clear, step-by-step proof that addresses the syntax issue while maintaining the logical integrity of the original plan.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof uses \"^2\" for squaring instead of \"*\" as in the theorem statement, leading to a mismatch in the final step.\nImprovement: Adjust the proof to consistently use \"*\" for squaring throughout, and ensure each step aligns with the theorem statement's form.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights the key issue causing the unsatisfactory result and provides a specific suggestion for improvement. \n\nTo elaborate:\n\n1. The main flaw is the inconsistency between the theorem statement (which uses \"x * x\") and the proof steps (which use \"x^2\"). This mismatch is likely causing Isabelle to fail in applying the final proof step.\n\n2. The proof structure and reasoning are generally correct, but the notation needs to be adjusted to match the theorem statement exactly.\n\n3. To improve, we should rewrite all instances of \"^2\" as \"*\" multiplication. For example, \"(x - y)^2\" should become \"(x - y) * (x - y)\".\n\n4. We should also ensure that each step in the proof uses the exact form \"x * x + y * y\" rather than \"x^2 + y^2\" to maintain consistency with the theorem statement.\n\n5. The 'simp' and 'this' tactics seem to be working well, so we can continue to use them. However, we might need to add some additional steps or use the 'algebra' tactic to handle the expanded multiplication terms.\n\n6. It's important to verify that each step logically follows from the previous one after making these changes, as the expanded multiplication might require additional intermediate steps.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to align the proof more closely with the theorem statement and successfully complete the proof in Isabelle.",
