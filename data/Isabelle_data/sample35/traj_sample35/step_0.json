    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Start with induction on n:\n   The theorem involves two variables, n and m. The planning suggests using structural induction on n, which is a good approach for proving properties of recursive functions like mymul.\n\n2. Set up the induction:\n   We should instruct the acting agent to apply induction on n. This will generate two subgoals:\n   - Base case: mymul MyZero m = mymul m MyZero\n   - Inductive step: ⋀k. mymul k m = mymul m k ⟹ mymul (MySuc k) m = mymul m (MySuc k)\n\n3. Prove the base case:\n   For the base case, we can use the definition of mymul and the lemma mymul_0_r. The proof should proceed as follows:\n   a. Expand the left side using the definition of mymul\n   b. Apply the lemma mymul_0_r to the right side\n   c. Show that both sides evaluate to MyZero\n\n4. Set up the inductive step:\n   For the inductive step, we need to assume the property holds for k (induction hypothesis) and prove it for MySuc k. The proof will involve:\n   a. Expanding mymul (MySuc k) m using the definition of mymul\n   b. Using the lemma mymul_succ_r to rewrite mymul m (MySuc k)\n   c. Applying the induction hypothesis\n   d. Using myadd_comm to rearrange terms\n\n5. Use available lemmas:\n   Remind the acting agent to make use of the provided lemmas (myadd_comm, mymul_0_r, and mymul_succ_r) as they will be crucial in simplifying expressions and completing the proof.\n\n6. Apply simplification and rewriting:\n   Encourage the use of simplification tactics and rewriting with equations to handle the expressions involving myadd and mymul.\n\n7. Verify each step:\n   After each significant step, verify that the goal has been transformed as expected and that we're making progress towards proving the theorem.\n\nThese reasoning steps should provide a clear path for the acting agent to begin the proof and make significant progress towards proving the mul_comm theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current outcome, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered a lexical error due to the use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒) instead of ASCII arrow symbols (=>) in type declarations.\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒) with ASCII arrow symbols (=>) in type declarations throughout the theory file to ensure proper parsing and compatibility with Isabelle/HOL syntax.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights the immediate issue causing the failure and provides a clear, actionable step to resolve it. By addressing this syntax error, we can progress to the actual proof steps without being hindered by parsing issues.\n\nFor future steps, we should:\n\n1. Carefully review the entire theory file for any other instances of Unicode symbols that might cause similar issues.\n\n2. Ensure that all syntax follows Isabelle/HOL conventions, paying special attention to operators and symbols.\n\n3. After fixing the syntax errors, proceed with the proof strategy as outlined in the previous reasoning step, starting with the induction on n.\n\n4. Verify that the provided lemmas (myadd_comm, mymul_0_r, and mymul_succ_r) are properly stated and can be used in the proof without encountering \"sorry\" statements.\n\n5. Focus on completing each case of the induction proof systematically, using the available lemmas and simplification tactics.\n\nBy addressing these points, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and make progress towards proving the mul_comm theorem.",
