    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for mul_comm theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that multiplication (mymul) is commutative for our custom natural number type (mynat).\n   - The theorem states: mymul n m = mymul m n\n\n2. Identify available resources:\n   - We have definitions for myadd and mymul functions.\n   - We have three lemmas that have been proved (or assumed proved with sorry):\n     a. myadd_comm: Addition is commutative\n     b. mymul_0_r: Multiplication by zero on the right gives zero\n     c. mymul_succ_r: Multiplication by successor on the right\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on one of the variables (let's choose n).\n   - Base case: Prove for n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Prove for n = MySuc k, assuming it holds for k\n\n4. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Start with induction on n\n   b. Base case (n = MyZero):\n      - Show mymul MyZero m = mymul m MyZero\n      - Use the definition of mymul and lemma mymul_0_r\n   c. Inductive step (n = MySuc k):\n      - Need to prove: mymul (MySuc k) m = mymul m (MySuc k)\n      - Use the definitions of mymul and lemma mymul_succ_r\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use lemma myadd_comm to rearrange terms\n\n5. Key proof techniques to apply:\n   - Structural induction\n   - Rewriting using function definitions\n   - Applying lemmas\n   - Using the induction hypothesis\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly applying the induction hypothesis\n   - Correctly using the lemmas, especially mymul_succ_r and myadd_comm\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered (MyZero and MySuc)\n   - Verify that the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The first and most crucial step is to correct the syntax errors in the theory file. We need to replace all instances of the Unicode arrow symbol (â‡’) with the ASCII arrow symbol (=>). This applies to the type declarations for both 'myadd' and 'mymul' functions.\n\n2. Verify Definitions and Lemmas:\n   After correcting the syntax, we should ensure that all function definitions and lemma statements are correctly parsed. Pay special attention to the 'myadd_comm', 'mymul_0_r', and 'mymul_succ_r' lemmas, as they are crucial for our proof.\n\n3. Proof Structure:\n   Once the syntax is corrected, we can proceed with the proof structure as previously outlined. The induction on 'n' is a good approach. We should start with:\n   \n   theorem mul_comm: \"mymul n m = mymul m n\"\n   proof (induction n)\n\n4. Base Case:\n   For the base case (n = MyZero), we need to show that:\n   mymul MyZero m = mymul m MyZero\n   This can be done using the definition of 'mymul' and the 'mymul_0_r' lemma.\n\n5. Inductive Step:\n   For the inductive step (n = MySuc k), we need to prove:\n   mymul (MySuc k) m = mymul m (MySuc k)\n   This will involve using the definition of 'mymul', the induction hypothesis, and the 'mymul_succ_r' and 'myadd_comm' lemmas.\n\n6. Simplification and Rewriting:\n   Throughout the proof, make extensive use of the 'simp' method to simplify expressions based on function definitions. Use the 'also' and 'finally' keywords to chain equalities for a clear, step-by-step proof.\n\n7. Lemma Application:\n   Apply the previously proven lemmas at appropriate points in the proof. For instance, use 'myadd_comm' when you need to swap the order of arguments in 'myadd'.\n\n8. Verification:\n   After completing each step of the proof, verify that the goal has been met and that each transformation is logically sound.\n",
