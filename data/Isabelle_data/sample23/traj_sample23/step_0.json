Start the proof by stating the goal: \"show Q a0\"\n   b. Use the universal quantifier in assumption 2 to instantiate it with a0\n   c. Apply modus ponens (MP) using the instantiated assumption and assumption 1\n   \n5. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Use \"have\" to instantiate the universal quantifier: \n      \"have \"P a0 ⟶ Q a0\" using assumption 2\n   b. Use \"then\" and \"have\" to apply modus ponens:\n      \"then have \"Q a0\" using assumption 1\n   c. Conclude the proof\n\n6. Consider potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but pay attention to correct syntax and inference rules.\n\n7. Prepare for reflection:\n   - After completing the proof, consider if there are any alternative approaches or if the proof can be made more concise.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem logic_ex6, we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to start the proof by stating our goal, which is to show \"Q a0\".\n\n2. We have two assumptions:\n   - Assumption 1: P a0\n   - Assumption 2: ∀a. P a ⟶ Q a\n\n3. To use these assumptions effectively, we should instantiate the universal quantifier in assumption 2 with a0. This will give us a specific instance that we can use for our proof.\n\n4. After instantiation, we'll have \"P a0 ⟶ Q a0\", which is exactly what we need to combine with our first assumption \"P a0\".\n\n5. We can then apply modus ponens (MP) using the instantiated assumption \"P a0 ⟶ Q a0\" and the first assumption \"P a0\" to derive our goal \"Q a0\".\n\n6. The proof should be structured using Isabelle's proof language, likely using \"have\" statements to derive intermediate results and \"show\" to state the final conclusion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying the 'proof' command to begin the proof, then use 'show' to state the goal, and proceed with the steps outlined above using 'have' statements to derive the conclusion.\n",
