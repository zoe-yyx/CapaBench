    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"chickens_and_rabbits\" Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We have two unknowns: C (chickens) and R (rabbits)\n   - We have two equations:\n     a) C + R = 35 (total number of animals)\n     b) 2C + 4R = 94 (total number of legs)\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use algebraic manipulation to solve the system of equations\n   - Isolate one variable and substitute it into the other equation\n\n3. Step-by-Step Plan:\n   a) From the first equation, express R in terms of C:\n      R = 35 - C\n\n   b) Substitute this expression into the second equation:\n      2C + 4(35 - C) = 94\n\n   c) Simplify the equation:\n      2C + 140 - 4C = 94\n\n   d) Combine like terms:\n      -2C + 140 = 94\n\n   e) Subtract 140 from both sides:\n      -2C = -46\n\n   f) Divide both sides by -2:\n      C = 23\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Start with the given assumptions\n   - Perform each algebraic step\n   - Use Isabelle's simplification and arithmetic reasoning capabilities\n   - Conclude with the final result C = 23\n\n5. Potential Challenges:\n   - Ensuring each algebraic step is properly justified in Isabelle\n   - Handling integer arithmetic correctly\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After proving C = 23, substitute back into the original equations to verify R = 12\n   - This step isn't necessary for the proof but can be done for completeness\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to prove that C = 23, satisfying the theorem statement.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof, we need to continue with the algebraic manipulation as planned. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have already derived \"R = 35 - C\" from the first equation. Now we need to substitute this into the second equation.\n\n2. The next step should be to take the equation \"2 * C + 4 * R = 94\" and replace R with (35 - C).\n\n3. After substitution, we'll have an equation with only C as the variable. We should simplify this equation by expanding and combining like terms.\n\n4. Once simplified, we'll have a linear equation in C. We should solve this equation to show that C = 23.\n\n5. Each step of this algebraic manipulation should be formalized in Isabelle using appropriate tactics. We can use 'have' statements to introduce each intermediate step, and use Isabelle's simplification and arithmetic reasoning capabilities (like 'simp' and 'algebra') to justify the calculations.\n\n6. Finally, we should use a 'show' statement to conclude that C = 23, which is the goal of our theorem.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps one at a time, ensuring each algebraic manipulation is properly justified in Isabelle's formal language. This approach will lead to a complete and rigorous proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails at the step where we try to simplify \"2 * C + 4 * (35 - C) = 94\" to \"2 * C + 140 - 4 * C = 94\" using the 'by algebra' tactic.\n\nImprovement: We should break down the algebraic manipulation into smaller, more explicit steps using 'have' statements and simpler tactics like 'simp' or combinations of 'simp' with specific rules.\n```\n\nThe current approach attempts to make a large algebraic simplification in one step, which Isabelle's 'algebra' tactic is unable to handle. To improve our proof, we should:\n\n1. Break down the algebraic manipulation into smaller, more manageable steps.\n2. Use more basic tactics like 'simp' or combinations of 'simp' with specific rules for each step.\n3. Explicitly state intermediate results using 'have' statements.\n4. Provide more detailed justifications for each step, possibly using the 'unfolding' keyword to apply definitions or previously proven equations.\n\nFor example, instead of:\n\n```isabelle\nhave \"2 * C + 4 * (35 - C) = 94\"\n  using eq2 r_eq by simp\n\nthen have \"2 * C + 140 - 4 * C = 94\"\n  by algebra\n```\n\nWe could try:\n\n```isabelle\nhave \"2 * C + 4 * (35 - C) = 94\"\n  using eq2 r_eq by simp\n\nthen have \"2 * C + 140 - 4 * C = 94\"\n  by (simp add: algebra)\n\nthen have \"2 * C + 140 - 4 * C = 2 * C - 4 * C + 140\"\n  by (simp add: algebra)\n\nthen have \"-2 * C + 140 = 94\"\n  by (simp add: algebra)\n```\n\nBy breaking down the steps and using more basic tactics, we can guide Isabelle through the proof more carefully, increasing the chances of success. The acting agent should focus on implementing these smaller, more explicit steps in the next iteration.",
