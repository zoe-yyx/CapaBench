    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"chickens_and_rabbits\" Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We have two unknowns: C (chickens) and R (rabbits)\n   - We have two equations:\n     a) C + R = 35 (total number of animals)\n     b) 2C + 4R = 94 (total number of legs)\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use algebraic manipulation to solve the system of equations\n   - Isolate one variable and substitute it into the other equation\n\n3. Step-by-Step Plan:\n   a) From the first equation, express R in terms of C:\n      R = 35 - C\n\n   b) Substitute this expression into the second equation:\n      2C + 4(35 - C) = 94\n\n   c) Simplify the equation:\n      2C + 140 - 4C = 94\n\n   d) Combine like terms:\n      -2C + 140 = 94\n\n   e) Subtract 140 from both sides:\n      -2C = -46\n\n   f) Divide both sides by -2:\n      C = 23\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Start with the given assumptions\n   - Perform each algebraic step\n   - Use Isabelle's simplification and arithmetic reasoning capabilities\n   - Conclude with the final result C = 23\n\n5. Potential Challenges:\n   - Ensuring each algebraic step is properly justified in Isabelle\n   - Handling integer arithmetic correctly\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After proving C = 23, substitute back into the original equations to verify R = 12\n   - This step isn't necessary for the proof but can be done for completeness\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to prove that C = 23, satisfying the theorem statement.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the \"chickens_and_rabbits\" theorem, we should start by introducing the given assumptions and then proceed with algebraic manipulation. Here's the reasoning for the first steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing the assumptions using the 'assume' command. This will bring our given equations into the proof context.\n\n2. Our first goal is to express R in terms of C using the first equation. We can do this by subtracting C from both sides of the equation C + R = 35.\n\n3. Once we have R expressed in terms of C, we can substitute this into the second equation. This will give us an equation with only one variable (C).\n\n4. After substitution, we'll need to simplify the resulting equation. This will involve distributing the multiplication and combining like terms.\n\n5. The simplified equation should then be solved for C.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these initial steps, particularly introducing the assumptions and performing the first algebraic manipulation to express R in terms of C. This will set the foundation for the rest of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete and ends prematurely with 'qed' before reaching the desired conclusion C = 23.\n\nImprovement: Continue the algebraic manipulation by substituting R = 35 - C into the second equation, simplify, and solve for C before concluding the proof.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt makes a good start by introducing the assumptions and deriving R in terms of C. However, it stops short of completing the necessary algebraic steps to reach the conclusion. \n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Substitute the expression for R (35 - C) into the second equation: 2 * C + 4 * R = 94.\n2. Simplify this equation by expanding and combining like terms.\n3. Solve the resulting equation for C.\n4. Show that C = 23 satisfies this equation.\n5. Use appropriate Isabelle tactics (like 'have', 'show', and arithmetic simplification) to formalize each step.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps one at a time, ensuring each is properly justified using Isabelle's proof methods. This systematic approach will lead to a complete and rigorous proof of the theorem.",
