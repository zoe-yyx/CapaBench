    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"chickens_and_rabbits\" Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We have two unknowns: C (chickens) and R (rabbits)\n   - We have two equations:\n     a) C + R = 35 (total number of animals)\n     b) 2C + 4R = 94 (total number of legs)\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use algebraic manipulation to solve the system of equations\n   - Isolate one variable and substitute it into the other equation\n\n3. Step-by-Step Plan:\n   a) From the first equation, express R in terms of C:\n      R = 35 - C\n\n   b) Substitute this expression into the second equation:\n      2C + 4(35 - C) = 94\n\n   c) Simplify the equation:\n      2C + 140 - 4C = 94\n\n   d) Combine like terms:\n      -2C + 140 = 94\n\n   e) Subtract 140 from both sides:\n      -2C = -46\n\n   f) Divide both sides by -2:\n      C = 23\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Start with the given assumptions\n   - Perform each algebraic step\n   - Use Isabelle's simplification and arithmetic reasoning capabilities\n   - Conclude with the final result C = 23\n\n5. Potential Challenges:\n   - Ensuring each algebraic step is properly justified in Isabelle\n   - Handling integer arithmetic correctly\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After proving C = 23, substitute back into the original equations to verify R = 12\n   - This step isn't necessary for the proof but can be done for completeness\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to prove that C = 23, satisfying the theorem statement.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is failing at a critical algebraic manipulation step. To address this, we need to break down the algebraic reasoning into smaller, more explicit steps that Isabelle can handle. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've successfully established the equation \"2 * C + 4 * (35 - C) = 94\" using the original equations and substitution.\n\n2. Now, we need to expand and simplify this equation step by step:\n\n   a) First, distribute the 4 over (35 - C):\n      \"2 * C + (4 * 35 - 4 * C) = 94\"\n\n   b) Then, simplify 4 * 35:\n      \"2 * C + (140 - 4 * C) = 94\"\n\n   c) Remove the parentheses:\n      \"2 * C + 140 - 4 * C = 94\"\n\n   d) Combine like terms:\n      \"-2 * C + 140 = 94\"\n\n3. For each of these steps, we should use a combination of 'have' statements and appropriate tactics like 'simp' or 'simp add: algebra'.\n\n4. After reaching \"-2 * C + 140 = 94\", we can proceed with solving for C:\n   \n   e) Subtract 140 from both sides:\n      \"-2 * C = -46\"\n\n   f) Divide both sides by -2:\n      \"C = 23\"\n\n5. Each step should be justified using appropriate Isabelle tactics, possibly combining 'simp' with specific algebraic rules or using 'argo' for arithmetic reasoning.\n\nBy following these smaller, more explicit steps, we should be able to guide Isabelle through the proof successfully, overcoming the current obstacle in the algebraic manipulation.\n",
