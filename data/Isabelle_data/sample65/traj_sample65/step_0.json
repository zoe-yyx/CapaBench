    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem \"P ∨ P ↔ P\", we should follow the plan of breaking down the proof into two directions. Let's start with the left-to-right implication (P ∨ P → P) as it requires more steps.\n\n1. We should begin by stating that we want to prove both directions of the equivalence. The 'apply (rule iffI)' command will help us do this, splitting the goal into two subgoals.\n\n2. For the first subgoal (P ∨ P → P), we need to perform a case analysis on P ∨ P. The 'apply (rule disjE)' command will allow us to do this, creating two cases: one where the left P is true, and another where the right P is true.\n\n3. After the case analysis, both cases will be trivial to prove, as P will be in our assumptions in both cases. The 'apply assumption' command should be sufficient to close both cases.\n\n4. For the second subgoal (P → P ∨ P), we can use the 'apply (rule disjI1)' command to prove that if P is true, then P ∨ P is true by proving the left disjunct.\n\n5. Finally, the 'apply assumption' command should complete the proof by using the assumption P to prove P.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the acting agent should start with the 'apply (rule iffI)' command to begin the proof process.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof was prematurely ended with 'qed' before addressing the two subgoals generated by the 'rule iffI' command.\n\nImprovement: Continue the proof by addressing each subgoal separately using case analysis for P ∨ P and direct implication for P, before concluding with 'qed'.\n```\n\nThe current attempt correctly started the proof by applying the 'rule iffI' command, which split the goal into two subgoals as planned. However, the proof was abruptly ended with 'qed' before these subgoals were addressed, resulting in an incomplete proof.\n\nTo improve the next steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Remove the premature 'qed' and continue the proof structure.\n2. Address the first subgoal (P ∨ P ⟹ P) using case analysis as originally planned. This can be done using 'apply (rule disjE)' followed by 'apply assumption' for both cases.\n3. For the second subgoal (P ⟹ P ∨ P), use 'apply (rule disjI1)' followed by 'apply assumption' as initially suggested.\n4. Only use 'qed' after both subgoals have been properly addressed.\n\nBy following these steps, the proof should progress as intended and successfully prove the theorem \"P ∨ P ↔ P\". The reasoning and acting agents should focus on implementing these steps in the correct order to complete the proof.",
