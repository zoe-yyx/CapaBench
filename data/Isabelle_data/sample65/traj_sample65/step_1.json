    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"P ∨ P ↔ P\" (P or P is equivalent to P)\n   - This is a bidirectional implication, so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Break down the proof into two parts:\n   a. P ∨ P → P (left to right implication)\n   b. P → P ∨ P (right to left implication)\n\n3. Proving P ∨ P → P:\n   - Use case analysis on the left side (P ∨ P)\n   - Show that in both cases (P is true or P is true), the right side (P) holds\n\n4. Proving P → P ∨ P:\n   - This direction is straightforward\n   - Show that if P is true, then P ∨ P is also true (by the definition of disjunction)\n\n5. Combine both directions:\n   - Use the iff_intro tactic to combine both implications into a bidirectional one\n\n6. Additional tactics to consider:\n   - rule: for applying inference rules\n   - simp: for simplification\n   - auto: for automated reasoning\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring that all cases are covered in the case analysis\n   - Properly justifying each step of the proof\n\n8. Final steps:\n   - Review the proof for completeness and correctness\n   - Ensure that all steps are properly justified and no assumptions are left unproven\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof has been correctly initiated using the 'rule iffI' command, which has split our goal into two subgoals as planned. However, we need to address each subgoal separately before concluding the proof. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. For the first subgoal (P ∨ P ⟹ P):\n   - We need to use case analysis on P ∨ P.\n   - Apply the disjunction elimination rule (disjE) to break down P ∨ P.\n   - For each case (P being true), we can directly use the assumption to prove P.\n\n2. For the second subgoal (P ⟹ P ∨ P):\n   - This is a straightforward implication.\n   - We can use the disjunction introduction rule (disjI1 or disjI2) to show that if P is true, then P ∨ P is true.\n   - After applying the rule, we can use the assumption to prove P.\n\n3. After addressing both subgoals, we can conclude the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps in order, using appropriate tactics for each step. This approach aligns with our original plan and addresses the issues highlighted in the reflection.\n",
