    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving theorem mul_1_l: \"mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = n\"\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are working with a custom natural number datatype 'mynat'\n   - We have custom addition (myadd) and multiplication (mymul) functions\n   - We need to prove that multiplying 1 (represented as MySuc MyZero) by any number n gives n\n\n2. Analyze the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of myadd and mymul\n   - Note that mymul is defined recursively using myadd\n\n3. Identify key steps:\n   a. Expand the definition of mymul for MySuc MyZero\n   b. Use the definition of myadd\n   c. Utilize the lemma myadd_0_r\n\n4. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side of the equation: mymul (MySuc MyZero) n\n   b. Apply the second case of mymul definition\n   c. Simplify using the definition of myadd\n   d. Apply the lemma myadd_0_r\n   e. Show that the result equals n (right-hand side of the equation)\n\n5. Prepare for potential induction:\n   - Although direct computation might be sufficient, be prepared to use induction on n if needed\n\n6. Plan to use Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'simp' for basic simplifications\n   - Apply 'auto' for more advanced simplification and reasoning\n   - Utilize 'rule' or 'drule' to apply the myadd_0_r lemma if necessary\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Verify that all cases are covered\n   - Check that the final result matches the theorem statement\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem mul_1_l, focusing on expanding definitions, applying known lemmas, and using Isabelle's proof tactics effectively.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The primary issue is a syntax error in the type declarations for 'myadd' and 'mymul' functions. This needs to be addressed before we can proceed with the proof.\n\n2. The arrow symbol used in the type declarations (\"⇒\") is not the correct one for Isabelle. We need to replace it with the standard Isabelle arrow symbol (\"=>\").\n\n3. Once this syntax error is fixed, the proof structure appears to be correct and follows our initial plan. It uses the appropriate tactics (simp and rule) and follows the logical steps we outlined.\n\n4. After fixing the syntax, we should attempt to run the proof again. If successful, this will validate our proof strategy.\n\n5. While the 'myadd_0_r' lemma is still marked with 'sorry', this doesn't prevent us from using it in our proof of 'mul_1_l'. However, for a complete theory, we should consider proving this lemma as well in the future.\n\n6. The current proof structure aligns well with our initial plan:\n   - It expands the definition of 'mymul' for 'MySuc MyZero'\n   - It uses the definition of 'myadd'\n   - It applies the 'myadd_0_r' lemma\n\n7. Assuming the syntax error is the only issue, once resolved, this proof should successfully demonstrate that \"mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = n\" for all n.\n\nNext steps for the acting agent:\n1. Correct the type declarations by replacing \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in both 'myadd' and 'mymul' function definitions.\n2. Run the proof again without any other changes.\n3. If successful, consider adding a proof for the 'myadd_0_r' lemma to complete the theory.\n",
