Understand the problem:\n   - We are working with a custom natural number datatype 'mynat'\n   - We have custom addition (myadd) and multiplication (mymul) functions\n   - We need to prove that multiplying 1 (represented as MySuc MyZero) by any number n gives n\n\n2. Analyze the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of myadd and mymul\n   - Note that mymul is defined recursively using myadd\n\n3. Identify key steps:\n   a. Expand the definition of mymul for MySuc MyZero\n   b. Use the definition of myadd\n   c. Utilize the lemma myadd_0_r\n\n4. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side of the equation: mymul (MySuc MyZero) n\n   b. Apply the second case of mymul definition\n   c. Simplify using the definition of myadd\n   d. Apply the lemma myadd_0_r\n   e. Show that the result equals n (right-hand side of the equation)\n\n5. Prepare for potential induction:\n   - Although direct computation might be sufficient, be prepared to use induction on n if needed\n\n6. Plan to use Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'simp' for basic simplifications\n   - Apply 'auto' for more advanced simplification and reasoning\n   - Utilize 'rule' or 'drule' to apply the myadd_0_r lemma if necessary\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Verify that all cases are covered\n   - Check that the final result matches the theorem statement\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem mul_1_l, focusing on expanding definitions, applying known lemmas, and using Isabelle's proof tactics effectively.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mul_1_l: \"mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = n\", we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. Start by expanding the definition of mymul for the case (MySuc MyZero). This will be our initial step in the proof.\n\n2. According to the definition of mymul, we know that:\n   mymul (MySuc n) m = myadd m (mymul n m)\n   \n   In our case, n is MyZero, so we get:\n   mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = myadd n (mymul MyZero n)\n\n3. Now, we need to simplify mymul MyZero n. From the first case of mymul definition, we know that:\n   mymul MyZero m = MyZero\n   \n   So, our equation becomes:\n   mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = myadd n MyZero\n\n4. At this point, we can see that the right-hand side of our equation matches the left-hand side of the lemma myadd_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n5. By applying the lemma myadd_0_r, we can conclude that:\n   mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = n\n\nThis reasoning demonstrates that we can prove the theorem by directly expanding the definitions and applying the given lemma, without the need for induction.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on applying these steps using appropriate Isabelle tactics, such as 'simp' for expanding definitions and simplification, and 'rule' or 'drule' for applying the myadd_0_r lemma.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails due to a lexical error in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function, specifically with the arrow symbol used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"=>\" in the type declarations for both 'myadd' and 'mymul' functions.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is a syntax error in the type declarations. Isabelle is very particular about the symbols used, and it appears that the arrow symbol used in the function type declarations is not the correct one for Isabelle.\n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. We need to modify the type declarations for both 'myadd' and 'mymul' functions. The correct arrow symbol in Isabelle is \"=>\", not \"⇒\".\n\n2. The acting agent should update the function declarations as follows:\n   - Change \"myadd :: \"mynat ⇒ mynat ⇒ mynat\"\" to \"myadd :: \"mynat => mynat => mynat\"\"\n   - Similarly for 'mymul', change \"mymul :: \"mynat ⇒ mynat ⇒ mynat\"\" to \"mymul :: \"mynat => mynat => mynat\"\"\n\n3. After fixing these type declarations, the proof structure itself looks correct and follows the reasoning steps we outlined earlier. The use of 'simp' and 'rule' tactics is appropriate.\n\n4. Once the syntax error is resolved, we should be able to run the proof again and potentially prove the theorem successfully.\n\n5. It's worth noting that the 'myadd_0_r' lemma is still marked with 'sorry'. In a complete proof, we would need to prove this lemma as well. However, for the purposes of proving 'mul_1_l', assuming 'myadd_0_r' as given is acceptable.\n\nMoving forward, the planning and reasoning agents should be more careful about using the correct Isabelle syntax, especially for commonly used symbols like function arrows. The acting agent should implement these changes and run the proof again.",
