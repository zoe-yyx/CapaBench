    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that double negation of P is equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' introduction rule to split the proof into two parts:\n     a) \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P\n     b) P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P\n\n3. Proof strategy for \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P:\n   - Start with the assumption \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Use proof by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this leads to a contradiction with \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Conclude P must be true\n\n4. Proof strategy for P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P:\n   - Start with the assumption P\n   - Prove \\<not>\\<not>P by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this contradicts the assumption P\n   - Conclude \\<not>\\<not>P must be true\n\n5. Combine the two directions to complete the iff proof\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's automated proof methods:\n   - Try 'auto' or 'blast' for potential automatic proof\n   - If automated methods fail, proceed with manual proof steps\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. The proof structure and tactics used so far are logically correct and align well with our initial plan. The issue appears to be technical rather than logical.\n\n2. The 'contradiction' tactic in the last step is an appropriate choice to complete the proof, as it should resolve the final subgoal where we have both P and Â¬P as assumptions, leading to a contradiction.\n\n3. Given that the error is related to database access and permissions, it's crucial to address these technical issues before proceeding with the proof.\n\n4. Once the environment issues are resolved, the acting agent should attempt to rerun the entire proof from the beginning. The current proof structure is as follows:\n\n   apply (rule iffI)\n   apply (rule classical)\n   apply (erule notE)\n   apply assumption\n   apply (rule notI)\n   apply (rule notI)\n   apply contradiction\n\n   This structure covers both directions of the iff statement and uses appropriate tactics for each step.\n\n5. If the proof runs successfully after resolving the technical issues, it should complete the theorem. \n\n6. In case the proof still fails after fixing the environment, the acting agent should focus on the specific step where the failure occurs and provide more detailed information about the remaining subgoals.\n\n7. As a fallback strategy, if the step-by-step proof encounters issues, the acting agent could try using Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'blast' to see if they can solve the theorem in one go.\n\nThe key is to first ensure the Isabelle environment is functioning correctly, then proceed with the existing proof structure, which is logically sound for proving the double negation theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the 'qed' command is failing to resolve all pending goals, suggesting some subgoals remain unproven.\n\nImprovement: We should break down the proof into smaller steps, using 'show' commands for each direction of the iff statement, and ensure each subgoal is explicitly proven before using 'qed'.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on this reflection:\n\n1. The current proof structure is logically sound, covering both directions of the iff statement. However, the failure at the 'qed' command suggests that not all subgoals have been fully resolved.\n\n2. The use of 'moreover' and 'ultimately' is correct for combining the two directions of the iff proof, but we may need to be more explicit in showing how these combine to prove the final theorem.\n\n3. To improve, we should:\n   a) Break down the proof into smaller, more explicit steps.\n   b) Use 'show' commands to clearly state what we're proving at each stage.\n   c) Ensure each direction of the iff statement is fully proven before combining them.\n   d) Use 'from' or 'using' commands to clearly indicate which previous results we're using in each step.\n\n4. We should also consider using Isabelle's automation tactics more strategically. For example, after proving each direction, we could use 'by (simp add: iff_def)' to simplify the iff statement.\n\n5. If breaking down the proof doesn't resolve the issue, we should consider using Isabelle's 'oops' command temporarily at different points in the proof to identify exactly where the problem occurs.\n\n6. Lastly, we should ensure that the Isabelle environment is functioning correctly and that there are no persisting technical issues from the previous attempts.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to construct a more robust and clear proof that Isabelle can fully verify.",
