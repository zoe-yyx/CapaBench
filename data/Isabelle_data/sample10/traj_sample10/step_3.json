    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that double negation of P is equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' introduction rule to split the proof into two parts:\n     a) \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P\n     b) P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P\n\n3. Proof strategy for \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P:\n   - Start with the assumption \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Use proof by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this leads to a contradiction with \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Conclude P must be true\n\n4. Proof strategy for P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P:\n   - Start with the assumption P\n   - Prove \\<not>\\<not>P by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this contradicts the assumption P\n   - Conclude \\<not>\\<not>P must be true\n\n5. Combine the two directions to complete the iff proof\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's automated proof methods:\n   - Try 'auto' or 'blast' for potential automatic proof\n   - If automated methods fail, proceed with manual proof steps\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is correct overall, but we've encountered an issue in the final step of the right-to-left direction (P ⟹ ¬¬P). We have successfully introduced the double negation and reached a state where we have a direct contradiction in our assumptions: P and ¬P.\n\nThe current goal state is:\n⟦P; ¬ P⟧ ⟹ False\n\nThis is a classic contradiction scenario, where we have both a proposition and its negation in our assumptions. In such cases, the most direct and efficient approach is to use Isabelle's built-in 'contradiction' tactic.\n\nThe 'contradiction' tactic is specifically designed to automatically detect and resolve contradictions in the assumption set. It's more appropriate and powerful in this context than trying to manually apply elimination rules like 'notE'.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to replace the last two lines of the proof:\napply (erule notE)\napply assumption\n\nwith a single application of the 'contradiction' tactic:\napply contradiction\n\nThis change should resolve the current issue and complete the proof of the double negation theorem. The 'contradiction' tactic will automatically recognize that P and ¬P cannot both be true, thereby proving False and closing this branch of the proof.\n\nAfter making this change, the entire proof should be complete, demonstrating that ¬¬P ↔ P holds for any proposition P.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof failed due to a system error related to database access, not due to a logical flaw in the proof structure.\n\nImprovement: We should verify the integrity of the Isabelle environment and database permissions, then retry the proof with the same logical structure, as it appears to be correct.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that the issue is not with the proof itself, but with the Isabelle environment. The error message suggests a problem with the database file being moved or having incorrect permissions, causing it to be read-only when it needs to be writable.\n\nThis is an external issue that prevents Isabelle from properly executing the proof, even though the proof structure itself seems correct. The proposed use of the 'contradiction' tactic in the last step is a valid approach to complete the proof.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. The Isabelle environment needs to be checked and fixed. This may involve:\n   - Ensuring the database file is in the correct location\n   - Verifying that the user has the necessary permissions to write to the database\n   - Possibly reinstalling or reconfiguring Isabelle if the issue persists\n\n2. Once the environment issues are resolved, the proof should be attempted again with the same structure. The logical steps are correct, and the use of 'contradiction' at the end is appropriate.\n\n3. If the environment is fixed and the proof still fails, then we would need to review the proof structure again. However, based on the current information, the proof structure appears to be correct and should work once the technical issues are resolved.\n\n4. It might be helpful to try the proof in a clean Isabelle environment or on a different machine to isolate whether this is a local configuration issue or a more general problem with the Isabelle installation.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the proof strategy is sound, but external factors are preventing its successful execution. Resolving these technical issues should allow the proof to proceed as intended.",
