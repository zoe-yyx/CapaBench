    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that double negation of P is equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' introduction rule to split the proof into two parts:\n     a) \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P\n     b) P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P\n\n3. Proof strategy for \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P:\n   - Start with the assumption \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Use proof by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this leads to a contradiction with \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Conclude P must be true\n\n4. Proof strategy for P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P:\n   - Start with the assumption P\n   - Prove \\<not>\\<not>P by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this contradicts the assumption P\n   - Conclude \\<not>\\<not>P must be true\n\n5. Combine the two directions to complete the iff proof\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's automated proof methods:\n   - Try 'auto' or 'blast' for potential automatic proof\n   - If automated methods fail, proceed with manual proof steps\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure is logically sound but seems to be too complex for Isabelle to process effectively. We should simplify our approach while maintaining the logical integrity of the proof. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. Maintain the overall structure of proving both directions of the iff statement.\n\n2. For the first direction (\\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P):\n   - Continue using the classical reasoning method, as it's appropriate for this type of proof.\n   - Keep the contradiction approach, as it's logically sound.\n\n3. For the second direction (P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P):\n   - Simplify this part significantly.\n   - Instead of using a nested proof structure, leverage Isabelle's automated reasoning capabilities.\n   - Use the 'simp' method, which is powerful for handling straightforward logical implications.\n\n4. Flatten the overall proof structure to reduce nesting, making it easier for Isabelle to process.\n\n5. If this simplified approach doesn't work, we should be prepared to break down the proof into even smaller, more explicit steps.\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's 'auto' method at the theorem level if the structured proof continues to fail. This might solve the entire theorem automatically.\n\nBy simplifying our proof structure and leveraging Isabelle's built-in methods more effectively, we increase the chances of Isabelle successfully processing and verifying our proof.\n",
