    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that double negation of P is equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' introduction rule to split the proof into two parts:\n     a) \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P\n     b) P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P\n\n3. Proof strategy for \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P:\n   - Start with the assumption \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Use proof by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this leads to a contradiction with \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Conclude P must be true\n\n4. Proof strategy for P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P:\n   - Start with the assumption P\n   - Prove \\<not>\\<not>P by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this contradicts the assumption P\n   - Conclude \\<not>\\<not>P must be true\n\n5. Combine the two directions to complete the iff proof\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's automated proof methods:\n   - Try 'auto' or 'blast' for potential automatic proof\n   - If automated methods fail, proceed with manual proof steps\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the double negation theorem, we need to address both directions of the bi-implication separately and use appropriate tactics for each. Let's start by focusing on the left-to-right direction (¬¬P ⟹ P):\n\n1. We've already applied (rule iffI) to split the bi-implication, which is correct.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction, we should use proof by contradiction. Apply (rule ccontr) to set up this approach.\n\n3. After applying (rule ccontr), we'll have the assumption ¬P in our context, along with the original assumption ¬¬P. These contradict each other, which we can use to complete this direction of the proof.\n\n4. For the right-to-left direction (P ⟹ ¬¬P), we need to introduce double negation. We can do this by applying (rule notI) twice.\n\n5. After these steps, the proof should be in a state where basic reasoning or assumption can complete it.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps one at a time, starting with (rule ccontr) for the left-to-right direction. If any step doesn't work as expected, we'll need to reassess and possibly provide more detailed tactical guidance.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was correct, but the application of (erule notE) in the last step was incorrect as it doesn't match the current goal state.\nImprovement: Instead of (erule notE), we should directly apply 'contradiction' tactic to resolve the contradiction between P and ¬P in the current goal.\n```\n\nThe overall structure of the proof is correct, and most of the steps are appropriate. The proof successfully splits the bi-implication and handles both directions. For the left-to-right direction, the proof by contradiction approach was correctly set up. For the right-to-left direction, the introduction of double negation was also done correctly.\n\nThe issue arises in the final step of the proof. After applying (rule notI) twice for the right-to-left direction, we have the goal \"⟦P; ¬ P⟧ ⟹ False\". At this point, we have a direct contradiction in our assumptions (P and ¬P), which can be resolved immediately.\n\nInstead of trying to use (erule notE), which doesn't match our current goal state, we should use the 'contradiction' tactic. This tactic is designed to automatically find and resolve contradictions in the assumptions, which is exactly what we need in this case.\n\nFor the next action step, the acting agent should replace the last two lines:\n\n```\napply (erule notE)\napply assumption\n```\n\nwith a single line:\n\n```\napply contradiction\n```\n\nThis should complete the proof successfully. If any issues persist after this change, we may need to review the entire proof structure again, but this adjustment should resolve the current problem and complete the proof of the double negation theorem.",
