    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that double negation of P is equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' introduction rule to split the proof into two parts:\n     a) \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P\n     b) P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P\n\n3. Proof strategy for \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P:\n   - Start with the assumption \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Use proof by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this leads to a contradiction with \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Conclude P must be true\n\n4. Proof strategy for P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P:\n   - Start with the assumption P\n   - Prove \\<not>\\<not>P by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this contradicts the assumption P\n   - Conclude \\<not>\\<not>P must be true\n\n5. Combine the two directions to complete the iff proof\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's automated proof methods:\n   - Try 'auto' or 'blast' for potential automatic proof\n   - If automated methods fail, proceed with manual proof steps\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Environment Issue Resolution:\n   The primary focus should be on resolving the SQLite database constraint error. This is crucial before attempting any further proof steps. The acting agent should:\n   a) Verify the Isabelle installation integrity.\n   b) Clear any cached session information.\n   c) Check for and resolve any database conflicts or corruptions.\n   d) If necessary, consult with system administrators or Isabelle documentation for resolving SQLite-related issues.\n\n2. Proof Strategy (Once Environment is Fixed):\n   After resolving the environment issue, proceed with the original proof strategy:\n   a) Start the proof with: apply (rule iffI)\n   b) Then try: apply auto\n   \n3. Fallback Plan:\n   If 'auto' doesn't complete the proof after fixing the environment:\n   a) For \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P direction:\n      - Use 'apply (rule ccontr)' for proof by contradiction\n      - Then guide through steps to derive a contradiction\n   b) For P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P direction:\n      - Use 'apply (rule notI)' followed by 'apply (rule notI)'\n      - Then show how assuming \\<not>P leads to a contradiction with P\n\n4. Alternative Automated Methods:\n   If 'auto' is insufficient, try:\n   - apply blast\n   - apply (metis double_negation)\n\n5. Manual Proof Steps:\n   Be prepared to guide through manual proof steps if automated methods fail, using Isabelle's basic proof commands and tactics.\n\nRemember, the key is to first ensure the environment is working correctly before proceeding with the actual proof steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof strategy used incorrect tactics, particularly 'rule classical' and 'erule notE', which are not appropriate for this theorem.\n\nImprovement: Simplify the proof strategy by using more basic tactics like 'rule ccontr' for the left-to-right direction and 'rule notI' (twice) for the right-to-left direction, followed by appropriate reasoning steps.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt has several issues:\n\n1. The use of 'rule classical' is unnecessary and complicates the proof. The double negation elimination can be proved without explicitly invoking classical logic.\n\n2. The 'erule notE' tactic is misapplied here. It's not clear what this was intended to achieve in this context.\n\n3. The proof steps don't clearly separate the two directions of the if-and-only-if statement, making the logic harder to follow.\n\n4. The final steps using 'assumption' are correct but insufficient to complete the proof.\n\nTo improve the proof process:\n\n1. Start with 'apply (rule iffI)' to split the bi-implication into two implications.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction (¬¬P ⟹ P), use 'apply (rule ccontr)' to set up a proof by contradiction.\n\n3. For the right-to-left direction (P ⟹ ¬¬P), use 'apply (rule notI)' twice to introduce the double negation.\n\n4. After these initial steps, use 'apply assumption' or other basic tactics to complete each direction of the proof.\n\n5. If these steps don't complete the proof automatically, be prepared to guide through the logical steps more explicitly, possibly using 'apply (erule notE)' or 'apply (erule contrapos_np)' at appropriate points.\n\nBy following this improved strategy, we should be able to construct a clear and correct proof of the double negation theorem.",
