    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that double negation of P is equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' introduction rule to split the proof into two parts:\n     a) \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P\n     b) P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P\n\n3. Proof strategy for \\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P:\n   - Start with the assumption \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Use proof by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this leads to a contradiction with \\<not>\\<not>P\n   - Conclude P must be true\n\n4. Proof strategy for P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P:\n   - Start with the assumption P\n   - Prove \\<not>\\<not>P by contradiction:\n     * Assume \\<not>P\n     * Show that this contradicts the assumption P\n   - Conclude \\<not>\\<not>P must be true\n\n5. Combine the two directions to complete the iff proof\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's automated proof methods:\n   - Try 'auto' or 'blast' for potential automatic proof\n   - If automated methods fail, proceed with manual proof steps\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the current situation, the primary focus should be on resolving the technical issue rather than modifying the proof itself. The reasoning for the next steps is as follows:\n\n1. Environment Resolution:\n   - The SQLite database error is the immediate obstacle preventing proof verification.\n   - This is likely an issue with Isabelle's configuration or file system permissions.\n   - Resolving this should be the first priority before attempting any changes to the proof.\n\n2. Proof Integrity:\n   - The existing proof structure appears logically sound and follows the planned strategy.\n   - It covers both directions of the iff statement and uses appropriate proof techniques.\n   - There's no immediate indication that the proof itself is flawed.\n\n3. Next Actions:\n   a) Instruct the acting agent to focus on resolving the SQLite database issue:\n      - Check file permissions for the Isabelle database.\n      - Ensure the database hasn't been moved or corrupted.\n      - Verify Isabelle's installation and configuration.\n   b) Once the environment issue is resolved, rerun the existing proof without modifications.\n   c) If the proof passes after environment resolution, no further proof modifications are needed.\n   d) If issues persist after environment resolution, proceed with a step-by-step verification of the proof.\n\n4. Proof Evaluation:\n   - Only after successful execution in a stable environment, evaluate the proof for potential optimizations.\n   - Consider using Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'blast' to potentially simplify the proof.\n\nThis approach ensures that we address the root cause of the current failure (environment issues) before unnecessarily modifying a potentially correct proof. It also maintains the integrity of the existing logical structure while leaving room for optimization once verification is successful.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is logically sound, but the failure to refine any pending goal suggests a mismatch between the proof steps and Isabelle's expectations.\n\nImprovement: Simplify the proof structure by using more direct proof methods and explicitly stating intermediate steps to align better with Isabelle's proof engine.\n```\n\nGiven the current observation, it appears that while our proof structure is logically correct, it's not being recognized properly by Isabelle. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. Overly complex proof structure: The nested proof blocks might be making it difficult for Isabelle to track the logical flow.\n2. Missing intermediate steps: There might be some logical leaps that are obvious to us but need to be explicitly stated for Isabelle.\n3. Suboptimal use of Isabelle's proof methods: We might be able to leverage Isabelle's built-in methods more effectively.\n\nTo improve our approach, I suggest the following:\n\n1. Simplify the proof structure: Try to flatten the nested proofs where possible.\n2. Use more direct proof methods: Isabelle has powerful automated methods like 'auto', 'blast', and 'simp' that can handle many logical steps automatically.\n3. Explicitly state intermediate steps: Break down the proof into smaller, clearly defined steps.\n4. Leverage Isabelle's classical reasoning: Make use of methods like 'classical' more directly in the main proof structure.\n\nFor the next iteration, consider rewriting the proof as follows:\n\n```isabelle\ntheorem double_negation_iff: \"\\<not>\\<not>P \\<longleftrightarrow> P\"\nproof\n  show \"\\<not>\\<not>P \\<Longrightarrow> P\"\n  proof (rule classical)\n    assume \"\\<not>\\<not>P\"\n    assume \"\\<not>P\"\n    from `\\<not>\\<not>P` `\\<not>P` show False by contradiction\n  qed\nnext\n  show \"P \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not>\\<not>P\"\n  proof\n    assume P\n    show \"\\<not>\\<not>P\"\n    by (simp add: `P`)\n  qed\nqed\n```\n\nThis simplified version maintains the logical structure but uses Isabelle's simplification method ('simp') to handle the second direction of the proof more directly. If this approach doesn't work, we may need to break down the proof into even smaller steps or consider using different proof methods.",
