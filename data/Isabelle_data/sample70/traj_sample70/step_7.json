    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem 'or_assoc1'.\n   - We need to show that \"(P ∨ Q) ∨ R\" follows from the assumption \"P ∨ (Q ∨ R)\".\n   - This is a logical equivalence problem involving the associativity of the OR operator.\n\n2. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   - Use a proof by cases (case analysis) on the assumption \"P ∨ (Q ∨ R)\".\n   - Consider three cases: P is true, Q is true, or R is true.\n\n3. Detailed Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof by applying the 'cases' method on the assumption.\n   b. For the case where P is true:\n      - Show that this directly implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R.\n   c. For the case where Q is true:\n      - Show that Q implies P ∨ Q, which then implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R.\n   d. For the case where R is true:\n      - Show that R directly implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R.\n\n4. Utilize Isabelle's Automation:\n   - After setting up the cases, try using Isabelle's 'auto' tactic to solve simple logical steps.\n   - If 'auto' doesn't completely solve each case, use more specific tactics like 'simp' or manual rule applications.\n\n5. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the goal is reached in each case.\n   - Check that no assumptions are left unused and the proof is complete.\n\n6. Refine if Necessary:\n   - If any step fails, consider breaking it down into smaller, more explicit steps.\n   - Look for opportunities to use existing theorems about logical operations if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next proving operation:\n\n1. Start by breaking down the proof into smaller, more explicit steps. We'll begin with the case analysis on the assumption \"P ∨ (Q ∨ R)\".\n\n2. For each case, we'll explicitly state the intermediate steps that lead to our conclusion, using basic inference rules.\n\n3. We'll use more basic tactics like 'rule', 'erule', and 'frule' instead of relying on automated tactics.\n\n4. After each step, we'll check the proof state to ensure Isabelle is following our reasoning.\n\n5. We'll pay special attention to how we're using the assumptions in each case, making sure we're not making any implicit logical jumps.\n\n6. If we encounter any complex logical steps, we'll consider proving them as separate lemmas first.\n\n7. We'll start with the following structure for our proof:\n\n   proof cases\n     assume \"P\"\n     show ?thesis\n     proof -\n       have \"P ∨ Q\" by (rule disjI1[OF `P`])\n       then have \"(P ∨ Q) ∨ R\" by (rule disjI1)\n       show ?thesis by (rule `(P ∨ Q) ∨ R`)\n     qed\n   next\n     assume \"Q ∨ R\"\n     show ?thesis\n     proof cases\n       assume \"Q\"\n       show ?thesis\n       proof -\n         have \"P ∨ Q\" by (rule disjI2[OF `Q`])\n         then have \"(P ∨ Q) ∨ R\" by (rule disjI1)\n         show ?thesis by (rule `(P ∨ Q) ∨ R`)\n       qed\n     next\n       assume \"R\"\n       show ?thesis\n       proof -\n         have \"(P ∨ Q) ∨ R\" by (rule disjI2[OF `R`])\n         show ?thesis by (rule `(P ∨ Q) ∨ R`)\n       qed\n     qed\n   qed\n\nThis structure explicitly shows each logical step, using basic rules to justify each inference. The acting agent should implement this proof structure, verifying each step as they go.\n",
