    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Node_inj_left:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We are working with a custom datatype 'tree' with three constructors: Leaf, and Node (which takes two trees and an int).\n   - The goal is to prove that if two Node constructions are equal, their left subtrees must be equal.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - This is an injectivity proof for the left component of the Node constructor.\n   - We can use the fact that constructors in datatypes are injective.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a) Start with the assumption that two Node constructions are equal.\n   b) Use the injectivity property of constructors to break down this equality.\n   c) Extract the equality of the left subtrees from the broken-down equation.\n\n4. Possible proof steps:\n   - Apply the assumption to start the proof.\n   - Use the inj (injection) attribute of the Node constructor.\n   - Extract the equality of left subtrees using conjunction elimination or similar tactics.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Isabelle might not automatically recognize the injectivity of the Node constructor.\n   - We may need to prove or invoke a general injectivity theorem for the tree datatype if not readily available.\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - simp (for simplification)\n   - rule (to apply specific rules or theorems)\n   - cases (in case we need to consider different cases of the tree structure)\n   - auto (for automated proving, if the proof is straightforward enough)\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Ensure that the proof concludes with showing \"l1 = l2\" as required by the theorem statement.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the Node_inj_left theorem, focusing on utilizing the injectivity property of datatype constructors.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt is logically correct but contains syntax errors due to the use of non-ASCII characters. To resolve this issue and improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Replace all instances of the non-ASCII conjunction symbol (âˆ§) with the ASCII equivalent (&).\n2. Simplify the proof structure by removing redundant steps.\n\nHere's the proposed revised proof structure:\n\n1. Start with the 'proof -' command to begin the proof.\n2. Use a single 'from assms have' statement to apply the tree.inject rule directly to the assumption, breaking down the Node equality into its components.\n3. Use 'then show ?thesis' to conclude the proof by simplification.\n\nThis approach maintains the logical flow of the original proof while addressing the parsing issues and improving conciseness. The acting agent should implement these changes and attempt to execute the proof again.\n",
