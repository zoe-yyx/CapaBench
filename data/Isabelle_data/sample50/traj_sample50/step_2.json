    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Node_inj_left:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We are working with a custom datatype 'tree' with three constructors: Leaf, and Node (which takes two trees and an int).\n   - The goal is to prove that if two Node constructions are equal, their left subtrees must be equal.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - This is an injectivity proof for the left component of the Node constructor.\n   - We can use the fact that constructors in datatypes are injective.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a) Start with the assumption that two Node constructions are equal.\n   b) Use the injectivity property of constructors to break down this equality.\n   c) Extract the equality of the left subtrees from the broken-down equation.\n\n4. Possible proof steps:\n   - Apply the assumption to start the proof.\n   - Use the inj (injection) attribute of the Node constructor.\n   - Extract the equality of left subtrees using conjunction elimination or similar tactics.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Isabelle might not automatically recognize the injectivity of the Node constructor.\n   - We may need to prove or invoke a general injectivity theorem for the tree datatype if not readily available.\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - simp (for simplification)\n   - rule (to apply specific rules or theorems)\n   - cases (in case we need to consider different cases of the tree structure)\n   - auto (for automated proving, if the proof is straightforward enough)\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Ensure that the proof concludes with showing \"l1 = l2\" as required by the theorem statement.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the Node_inj_left theorem, focusing on utilizing the injectivity property of datatype constructors.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the database constraint error encountered, our primary focus should be on resolving the technical issues with the Isabelle environment before proceeding with the proof. The reasoning for the next steps is as follows:\n\n1. Environment Troubleshooting:\n   - The error message suggests a problem with the Isabelle session management database.\n   - This issue is preventing the proof from being processed and verified.\n   - Resolving this technical problem is crucial before we can meaningfully engage with the actual proof.\n\n2. Proof Structure Assessment:\n   - While we can't verify the proof due to the environment issue, we can still assess its structure.\n   - The current proof attempt uses the 'assms' to restate the assumption and then applies 'simp'.\n   - This approach might be too simplistic for proving the injectivity property we're aiming for.\n\n3. Next Steps:\n   a) First and foremost, address the database constraint error:\n      - Check for any Isabelle updates or known issues.\n      - Clear cached session data or temporary files.\n      - Restart the Isabelle environment or the entire system if necessary.\n   \n   b) Once the environment is stable, verify with a simple lemma before attempting Node_inj_left again.\n   \n   c) If the proof still fails after resolving environment issues, consider expanding the proof:\n      - Explicitly state and use the injectivity property of the Node constructor.\n      - Break down the equality assumption step by step.\n      - Use more specific tactics like 'inj' or 'cases' instead of relying solely on 'simp'.\n\n4. Proof Refinement (once environment is stable):\n   - Start by applying the assumption explicitly.\n   - Use the injectivity property of the Node constructor to break down the equality.\n   - Extract the equality of left subtrees using appropriate tactics.\n   - Conclude by showing l1 = l2 as required by the theorem statement.\n\nThe acting agent should prioritize resolving the environment issue before attempting to modify or re-run the proof. Once a stable environment is achieved, we can focus on refining the proof strategy if needed.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof contains non-ASCII characters (∧) which are causing parsing errors in Isabelle.\nImprovement: Replace all instances of the non-ASCII conjunction symbol (∧) with the ASCII equivalent (&) to ensure proper parsing and execution of the proof.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt is structurally sound and follows a logical approach to proving the theorem. However, the use of non-ASCII characters is preventing Isabelle from parsing the proof correctly. This is a common issue when proofs are written in text editors that automatically replace ASCII symbols with their Unicode equivalents.\n\nTo address this issue and improve the proof:\n\n1. Replace all instances of \"∧\" with \"&\" in the proof.\n2. Double-check for any other non-ASCII characters that might have been introduced (e.g., \"→\" instead of \"-->\").\n3. After making these changes, re-run the proof to ensure it parses correctly.\n\nAdditionally, while the proof structure is correct, we can make it more concise:\n\n1. The first 'have' statement is redundant as it's identical to the assumption.\n2. We can combine the two 'have' statements into a single one, directly applying tree.inject to the assumption.\n\nHere's a suggested improved version of the proof:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma Node_inj_left: \n  assumes \"Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2\"\n  shows \"l1 = l2\"\nproof -\n  from assms have \"l1 = l2 & v1 = v2 & r1 = r2\" by (simp add: tree.inject)\n  then show ?thesis by simp\nqed\n```\n\nThis version should parse correctly and prove the theorem efficiently. If any issues persist after these changes, we should verify that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and that there are no underlying system or configuration problems.",
