    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Node_inj_left:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We are working with a custom datatype 'tree' with three constructors: Leaf, and Node (which takes two trees and an int).\n   - The goal is to prove that if two Node constructions are equal, their left subtrees must be equal.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - This is an injectivity proof for the left component of the Node constructor.\n   - We can use the fact that constructors in datatypes are injective.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a) Start with the assumption that two Node constructions are equal.\n   b) Use the injectivity property of constructors to break down this equality.\n   c) Extract the equality of the left subtrees from the broken-down equation.\n\n4. Possible proof steps:\n   - Apply the assumption to start the proof.\n   - Use the inj (injection) attribute of the Node constructor.\n   - Extract the equality of left subtrees using conjunction elimination or similar tactics.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Isabelle might not automatically recognize the injectivity of the Node constructor.\n   - We may need to prove or invoke a general injectivity theorem for the tree datatype if not readily available.\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - simp (for simplification)\n   - rule (to apply specific rules or theorems)\n   - cases (in case we need to consider different cases of the tree structure)\n   - auto (for automated proving, if the proof is straightforward enough)\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Ensure that the proof concludes with showing \"l1 = l2\" as required by the theorem statement.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the Node_inj_left theorem, focusing on utilizing the injectivity property of datatype constructors.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the Node_inj_left theorem, we should start by leveraging the assumption given in the theorem statement. The key insight is that datatype constructors are injective, which means that if two constructed values are equal, their corresponding components must also be equal.\n\nGiven that we have no historical actions and the current observation is empty, we are at the beginning of the proof. The most logical first step is to introduce the assumption and then use the injectivity property of the Node constructor to break down the equality.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should begin by introducing the assumption \"Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2\" into the proof context. This will allow us to work with this equality.\n\n2. After introducing the assumption, we should apply the injectivity property of the Node constructor. This property states that if Node a b c = Node x y z, then a = x, b = y, and c = z.\n\n3. By applying the injectivity property, we'll obtain three separate equalities: l1 = l2, v1 = v2, and r1 = r2.\n\n4. Since our goal is to show that l1 = l2, we can then focus on this particular equality and discard the others.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the acting agent should start by applying the assumption and then use a tactic or method that applies the injectivity of the Node constructor. The exact tactic might depend on how Isabelle handles injectivity for custom datatypes, but common approaches include using 'simp' with appropriate rules or explicitly applying an injectivity rule if available.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a database constraint error, not due to a flaw in the logical reasoning or proof structure.\n\nImprovement: We should focus on resolving the technical issue with the Isabelle environment or database, ensuring that the session can be properly created and saved before proceeding with the proof.\n```\n\nThe current situation presents an unexpected challenge that is not directly related to the proof itself, but rather to the Isabelle environment or its associated database. This error suggests that there might be an issue with session management or data persistence in the Isabelle setup.\n\nTo move forward effectively:\n\n1. We need to investigate and resolve the database constraint error. This may involve checking the Isabelle configuration, ensuring there are no conflicting sessions, or possibly clearing any cached session data.\n\n2. Once the technical issue is resolved, we should be able to run the proof again. The current proof structure seems logically sound, using the assumption and then applying simp to leverage the injectivity of the Node constructor.\n\n3. After resolving the technical issue, if the proof still doesn't go through, we may need to consider more explicit steps. For instance, we could try using the induction method on the tree datatype or explicitly stating the injectivity property of the Node constructor.\n\n4. It's important to ensure that the Isabelle environment is stable and functioning correctly before proceeding with complex proofs. This may involve running simpler tests or proofs to verify the system's operational status.\n\n5. In future attempts, we should be prepared for potential system-level issues and have a troubleshooting protocol in place to quickly identify and resolve such problems.\n\nBy addressing the technical issue first and then returning to the logical aspects of the proof, we can ensure a more robust and reliable proving process moving forward.",
