    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that addition (+) is associative for integers.\n   - We need to use the definition of 'assoc' provided in the theory.\n\n2. Unfold the Definition:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of addition.\n   - This will give us the expanded form of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Simplify the Goal:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the goal to make it more manageable.\n   - We should end up with a goal that looks like:\n     ∀x y z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)\n\n4. Prove by Induction or Direct Calculation:\n   - For integers, we can prove this directly without induction.\n   - Use the built-in properties of addition in Isabelle/HOL.\n\n5. Apply Arithmetic Rules:\n   - Utilize Isabelle's arithmetic simplification rules.\n   - These rules should automatically handle the associativity of addition.\n\n6. Conclude the Proof:\n   - If the previous steps are successful, the proof should be complete.\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to finalize the proof.\n\n7. Verify and Reflect:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged.\n   - Check if the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any remaining subgoals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The primary issue is the use of incorrect arrow symbols in the type definition. We need to replace all instances of '⇒' with '=>' in the 'assoc' definition.\n\n2. Rewrite the Definition:\n   Modify the 'assoc' definition as follows:\n   definition assoc :: \"(int => int => int) => bool\" where\n     \"assoc f ⟷ (∀x y z. f x (f y z) = f (f x y) z)\"\n\n3. Maintain Proof Structure:\n   The current proof structure using 'unfolding' and 'by auto' is correct and should be maintained.\n\n4. Verify Unicode Symbols:\n   Ensure that other Unicode symbols like '⟷' and '∀' are correctly interpreted by Isabelle. If not, replace them with their ASCII equivalents ('<->' and '!', respectively).\n\n5. Rerun Proof:\n   After making these corrections, rerun the entire proof script to verify that the lexical error is resolved and the proof proceeds as expected.\n\n6. Observe Results:\n   Carefully observe the output after rerunning the proof. If successful, the 'plus_assoc' lemma should be proven without any remaining subgoals.\n\n7. Prepare for Further Debugging:\n   If any new errors or issues arise, be prepared to provide detailed error messages for further analysis and reasoning.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The definition of 'assoc' still contains Unicode symbols that Isabelle is not interpreting correctly, specifically the '<->' and '!' symbols.\n\nImprovement: Replace all Unicode symbols in the 'assoc' definition with their ASCII equivalents, using '\\\\<longleftrightarrow>' for '<->' and '\\\\<forall>' for '!'.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that despite our previous efforts to correct the syntax, we still have issues with Unicode symbols in the 'assoc' definition. The inner syntax error suggests that Isabelle is not correctly interpreting these symbols.\n\nTo improve our next steps, we should:\n\n1. Carefully review and replace all Unicode symbols in the 'assoc' definition with their ASCII equivalents that Isabelle can interpret correctly.\n\n2. Pay close attention to the exact syntax Isabelle expects for logical symbols. For example, '<->' should be replaced with '\\\\<longleftrightarrow>' and '!' should be replaced with '\\\\<forall>'.\n\n3. After making these changes, re-run the proof to ensure that the syntax errors are resolved.\n\n4. If successful, the proof should proceed without syntax errors, allowing us to focus on the logical aspects of the proof if any further issues arise.\n\n5. Be prepared to provide more detailed error messages if new issues occur after these changes, as they may point to deeper logical or structural problems in the proof.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to resolve the current syntax issues and move forward with the proof of the 'plus_assoc' lemma.",
