    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that addition (+) is associative for integers.\n   - We need to use the definition of 'assoc' provided in the theory.\n\n2. Unfold the Definition:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of addition.\n   - This will give us the expanded form of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Simplify the Goal:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the goal to make it more manageable.\n   - We should end up with a goal that looks like:\n     ∀x y z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)\n\n4. Prove by Induction or Direct Calculation:\n   - For integers, we can prove this directly without induction.\n   - Use the built-in properties of addition in Isabelle/HOL.\n\n5. Apply Arithmetic Rules:\n   - Utilize Isabelle's arithmetic simplification rules.\n   - These rules should automatically handle the associativity of addition.\n\n6. Conclude the Proof:\n   - If the previous steps are successful, the proof should be complete.\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to finalize the proof.\n\n7. Verify and Reflect:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged.\n   - Check if the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any remaining subgoals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is the use of Unicode symbols in the 'assoc' definition, which Isabelle is unable to parse correctly. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we need to:\n\n1. Modify the 'assoc' definition by replacing all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents:\n   - Replace '⇒' with '=>'\n   - Replace '⟷' with '\\<longleftrightarrow>'\n   - Replace '∀' with '\\<forall>'\n\n2. Ensure the type definition uses ASCII symbols as well.\n\n3. After making these changes, we should attempt to prove the lemma using the same approach as before:\n   - Unfold the 'assoc' definition\n   - Apply automation (using 'by auto')\n\n4. If the proof succeeds after these changes, we can conclude that the associativity of addition for integers has been proven.\n\n5. If any new errors occur, we should carefully examine the output and address each issue systematically before proceeding further.\n\nThis approach should resolve the lexical errors and allow us to proceed with the proof of the 'plus_assoc' lemma, aligning with our overall goal of successfully proving the associativity of addition for integers.\n",
