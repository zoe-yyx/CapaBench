Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that addition (+) is associative for integers.\n   - We need to use the definition of 'assoc' provided in the theory.\n\n2. Unfold the Definition:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of addition.\n   - This will give us the expanded form of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Simplify the Goal:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the goal to make it more manageable.\n   - We should end up with a goal that looks like:\n     ∀x y z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)\n\n4. Prove by Induction or Direct Calculation:\n   - For integers, we can prove this directly without induction.\n   - Use the built-in properties of addition in Isabelle/HOL.\n\n5. Apply Arithmetic Rules:\n   - Utilize Isabelle's arithmetic simplification rules.\n   - These rules should automatically handle the associativity of addition.\n\n6. Conclude the Proof:\n   - If the previous steps are successful, the proof should be complete.\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to finalize the proof.\n\n7. Verify and Reflect:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged.\n   - Check if the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any remaining subgoals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem description and planning strategy, here's my reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc':\n   The first step should be to unfold the definition of 'assoc' in the context of addition. This will give us a clear view of what exactly needs to be proved.\n\n2. Apply the definition to the lambda function:\n   After unfolding, we need to apply the definition to the specific lambda function (λx y. x + y) that represents addition.\n\n3. Simplify the resulting expression:\n   Once we've applied the definition, we should simplify the resulting expression. This should lead us to a goal that looks like:\n   ∀x y z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)\n\n4. Use Isabelle's built-in arithmetic properties:\n   Isabelle/HOL has built-in knowledge about the properties of integer arithmetic, including associativity. We should leverage these properties to prove our goal.\n\n5. Apply automation:\n   Given that associativity of addition is a fundamental property, Isabelle's automated proof methods should be able to handle this proof once we've set it up correctly.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following sequence of actions for the acting agent:\n\n1. Use 'unfold assoc' to expand the definition.\n2. Apply the definition to our specific lambda function.\n3. Simplify the resulting expression.\n4. Try to use Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'simp' to complete the proof.\n\nIf these steps don't fully prove the theorem, we may need to provide more explicit guidance on using specific arithmetic rules or properties of addition.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type definition, specifically with the arrow symbols used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbols (⇒) with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol (=>) in the type definition to resolve the lexical error and proceed with the proof.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the syntax used for defining the type of the 'assoc' function. In Isabelle, the correct arrow symbol for function types is '=>', not '⇒'. This small but crucial detail is causing the lexical error and preventing the proof from proceeding.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should carefully review and correct the syntax in the theory definition, especially focusing on replacing '⇒' with '=>' in the type definition of 'assoc'.\n\n2. After making this correction, the agent should attempt to rerun the proof script.\n\n3. If the lexical error is resolved, the proof might proceed automatically as the current proof script using 'unfolding' and 'by auto' is correct in structure.\n\n4. The reasoning agent should pay extra attention to Isabelle-specific syntax in future steps, ensuring that all symbols and notations are correctly used according to Isabelle's standards.\n\n5. If any further issues arise after correcting the arrow symbols, the acting agent should provide more detailed error messages to guide the next reflection and reasoning steps.\n\nThis approach should resolve the immediate syntactic issue and allow the proof to proceed, potentially leading to a successful certification of the 'plus_assoc' theorem.",
