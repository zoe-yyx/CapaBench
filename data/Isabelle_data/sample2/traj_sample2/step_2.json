    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that addition (+) is associative for integers.\n   - We need to use the definition of 'assoc' provided in the theory.\n\n2. Unfold the Definition:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of addition.\n   - This will give us the expanded form of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Simplify the Goal:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the goal to make it more manageable.\n   - We should end up with a goal that looks like:\n     ∀x y z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)\n\n4. Prove by Induction or Direct Calculation:\n   - For integers, we can prove this directly without induction.\n   - Use the built-in properties of addition in Isabelle/HOL.\n\n5. Apply Arithmetic Rules:\n   - Utilize Isabelle's arithmetic simplification rules.\n   - These rules should automatically handle the associativity of addition.\n\n6. Conclude the Proof:\n   - If the previous steps are successful, the proof should be complete.\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to finalize the proof.\n\n7. Verify and Reflect:\n   - Ensure all proof obligations are discharged.\n   - Check if the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any remaining subgoals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo resolve the inner syntax error and proceed with the proof, we need to modify the definition of 'assoc' to use Isabelle-compatible syntax. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Replace Unicode symbols with ASCII equivalents:\n   - Replace '<->' with '\\\\<longleftrightarrow>' for logical equivalence.\n   - Replace '!' with '\\\\<forall>' for the universal quantifier.\n\n2. Ensure proper spacing and parentheses:\n   - Maintain clear spacing between operators and terms.\n   - Keep the overall structure of the definition intact.\n\n3. Rewrite the 'assoc' definition:\n   The corrected definition should look like this:\n   definition assoc :: \"(int ⇒ int ⇒ int) ⇒ bool\" where\n     \"assoc f \\\\<longleftrightarrow> (\\\\<forall>x y z. f x (f y z) = f (f x y) z)\"\n\n4. After correcting the definition, proceed with the proof:\n   - Unfold the corrected 'assoc' definition.\n   - Apply automation tactics like 'auto' to prove the lemma.\n\n5. If the proof succeeds after these changes, the lemma should be complete.\n\n6. If any new errors occur, carefully examine the output for additional syntax or logical issues.\n\nBy implementing these steps, we should resolve the current syntax error and be able to proceed with the proof of the 'plus_assoc' lemma.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The definition of 'assoc' still contains Unicode symbols that are causing lexical errors in Isabelle.\n\nImprovement: Replace all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents in the 'assoc' definition, including '⇒' with '=>' and '⟷' with '\\<longleftrightarrow>'.\n```\n\nThe current result is unsatisfactory because the inner lexical error persists due to the use of Unicode symbols that Isabelle cannot parse correctly. We missed replacing all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents in our previous action, which led to the continued error.\n\nTo improve our next steps, we should:\n\n1. Carefully review and replace all Unicode symbols in the 'assoc' definition with their ASCII equivalents. This includes:\n   - Replace '⇒' with '=>'\n   - Replace '⟷' with '\\<longleftrightarrow>'\n   - Replace '∀' with '\\<forall>'\n\n2. Ensure that the syntax for the type definition uses ASCII symbols as well.\n\n3. Double-check the spacing and parentheses to maintain the correct structure of the definition.\n\n4. After making these changes, attempt to prove the lemma again using the same approach (unfolding the definition and applying automation).\n\n5. If any new errors occur, carefully examine the output and address each issue systematically.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to resolve the lexical errors and proceed with the proof of the 'plus_assoc' lemma. This approach aligns with our overall goal of successfully proving the problem by ensuring that Isabelle can correctly parse and process our definitions and lemmas.",
