    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for shift_up1_shift_left1_comm:\n\n1. Analyze the definitions:\n   - Understand the definitions of shift_left1 and shift_up1\n   - Identify how these functions operate on a given function f and input x\n\n2. Expand the theorem statement:\n   - Write out the left-hand side: shift_up1 (shift_left1 f)\n   - Write out the right-hand side: shift_left1 (shift_up1 f)\n\n3. Apply function composition:\n   - Apply the definitions to both sides of the equation\n   - Simplify the expressions step by step\n\n4. Prove equality:\n   - Show that both sides of the equation yield the same result for any arbitrary input x\n\n5. Use extensionality:\n   - Prove that the functions are equal by showing they produce the same output for all inputs\n\n6. Simplification steps:\n   - Use the simplification tactic (simp) with the definitions of shift_left1 and shift_up1\n   - Possibly use the 'auto' tactic to handle basic arithmetic\n\n7. Potential additional steps:\n   - If needed, use 'apply (rule ext)' to apply function extensionality\n   - Use 'by (simp add: shift_left1_def shift_up1_def)' to unfold definitions and simplify\n\n8. Final verification:\n   - Ensure all goals are discharged\n   - Check that the proof is complete and accepted by Isabelle\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the commutativity of shift_up1 and shift_left1 operations, focusing on expanding definitions, applying function composition, and leveraging Isabelle's simplification tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and reflection, the primary issue is not with the proof itself but with the Isabelle environment. The database-related errors are preventing the successful execution and recording of the proof. Therefore, our reasoning should focus on addressing these technical issues before proceeding with the proof.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. Environment Check: Before attempting to prove the theorem, we need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up. This includes:\n   a. Verifying database file location and permissions\n   b. Checking user rights and privileges\n   c. Ensuring sufficient disk space\n   d. Reviewing Isabelle configuration files\n\n2. Proof Validation: Once the environment issues are resolved, we should re-run the existing proof as it appears to be correct. The proof steps are:\n   a. Apply function extensionality with 'apply (rule ext)'\n   b. Use simplification with definitions: 'apply (simp add: shift_up1_def shift_left1_def)'\n\n3. Theorem Analysis: The theorem statement \"shift_up1 (shift_left1 f) = shift_left1 (shift_up1 f)\" is correct and doesn't need modification.\n\n4. Next Steps: After resolving the environment issues:\n   a. Re-run the existing proof\n   b. If successful, no further action is needed for this theorem\n   c. If issues persist, we may need to break down the proof into smaller steps or use alternative tactics\n\nThe acting agent should focus on resolving the database and environment issues before attempting to re-run or modify the proof.\n",
