    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the lemma shift_up1_eq, we should start by applying function extensionality. This is because we're trying to prove that two functions are equal, and the best way to do this is to show that they produce the same output for all possible inputs.\n\nThe reasoning steps are as follows:\n\n1. Apply function extensionality. This will transform our goal from proving that the functions are equal to proving that they produce the same output for an arbitrary input.\n\n2. After applying extensionality, we should expand the definitions of both shift_up1 and func_plus. This will allow us to see the explicit expressions we're working with.\n\n3. Once the definitions are expanded, we'll need to simplify the right-hand side, particularly the application of the lambda function (λx. 1).\n\n4. After simplification, we should have two expressions that are visibly equal, both representing f x + 1.\n\n5. At this point, the proof should be complete, as the equality will be obvious.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I suggest that the acting agent start by applying function extensionality and then proceed to unfold the definitions of shift_up1 and func_plus.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type definition of shift_up1, specifically with the use of unicode arrow symbols (⇒) which are not properly recognized.\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of the unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) in the type definitions and throughout the theory file to ensure proper parsing and compatibility.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the use of unicode symbols that are not being correctly interpreted by Isabelle. The improvement suggests a straightforward solution to use ASCII symbols instead, which should resolve the parsing error and allow the proof to proceed.\n\nFor the next steps, the planning and reasoning agents should focus on:\n\n1. Reviewing and updating all type definitions and function signatures to use ASCII symbols.\n2. Ensuring consistency in symbol usage throughout the entire theory file.\n3. After fixing the syntax issues, revisiting the proof strategy to ensure it aligns with the correct syntax and Isabelle's expectations.\n\nThe acting agent should then implement these changes, starting with replacing all ⇒ with => in the definitions of shift_up1 and func_plus. This should allow the parser to correctly interpret the theory file and move forward with the proof attempt.",
