    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and planning strategy, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. The problem involves proving that when two Node constructions are equal, their value components are also equal. This is a straightforward application of the injectivity property of datatype constructors.\n\n2. The proof should start by focusing on the assumption \"Node l1 v1 r1 = Node l2 v2 r2\". This equality between two Node constructions is the key to deriving the desired conclusion.\n\n3. The datatype definition for 'tree' automatically generates injectivity rules for its constructors. These rules allow us to conclude that when two Node constructions are equal, their corresponding components must also be equal.\n\n4. The most direct approach would be to use a tactic that can automatically apply these injectivity rules. The 'auto' tactic is often capable of handling such cases.\n\n5. If 'auto' doesn't immediately solve the problem, we may need to explicitly apply the injectivity rule for the Node constructor. This can typically be done using the 'inj' attribute or a similar mechanism in Isabelle.\n\n6. Once the injectivity is applied, we should get three equalities: l1 = l2, v1 = v2, and r1 = r2. The middle equality (v1 = v2) is exactly what we need to prove.\n\n7. If the above steps don't immediately solve the problem, we might need to explicitly extract the v1 = v2 equality and present it as the conclusion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I recommend starting with the 'auto' tactic, as it's likely to solve this problem in one step. If that doesn't work, we should then move to explicitly applying the injectivity rule for the Node constructor.\n",
