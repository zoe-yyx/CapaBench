    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem forall_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves universal quantification and implications.\n   - We need to prove that for all x, if P(x) and Q(x) are true, then R(x) is true.\n\n2. Identify the given assumption:\n   - We have: ∀x. (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) → R(x)\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the \"prove\" method to start the proof.\n   - Introduce an arbitrary but fixed x using \"fix\" command.\n   - Assume the antecedents P(x) and Q(x) using \"assume\" command.\n   - Show that R(x) follows from these assumptions.\n\n4. Utilize the assumption:\n   - Apply the assumption to the fixed x we introduced.\n   - Use the assumed P(x) and Q(x) to satisfy the antecedent of the assumption.\n\n5. Complete the proof:\n   - Once R(x) is derived, use \"show\" to conclude the implication.\n   - The universal quantification will be automatically handled by the \"fix\" step.\n\n6. Potential proof techniques:\n   - Use introduction rules for implications and conjunctions.\n   - Apply elimination rules as necessary.\n   - Consider using the \"erule\" tactic to eliminate the universal quantifier in the assumption.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure all assumptions are used.\n   - Check that the proof follows logically from the given assumption to the conclusion.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, focusing on breaking down the universal quantification and working with the implications in a step-by-step manner.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is logically correct and follows the planned strategy well. We have successfully:\n\n1. Fixed an arbitrary x\n2. Assumed P(x) and Q(x)\n3. Derived P(x) ∧ Q(x)\n4. Applied the assumption to get P(x) ∧ Q(x) → R(x)\n5. Derived R(x)\n\nHowever, the final \"thus\" statement is causing an error because it's redundant. The \"have\" statement that derives \"R x\" is sufficient to complete the proof. \n\nTo fix this issue and complete the proof:\n\n1. Remove the line \"thus \"R x\" .\"\n2. The proof should end immediately after the \"have\" statement that derives \"R x\"\n\nThis adjustment will resolve the error and successfully prove the theorem. The universal quantification (∀x) is implicitly handled by the \"fix x\" at the beginning of the proof, so no further steps are needed after proving R(x) for the arbitrary x.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but it fails to explicitly show the implication structure (P x ⟶ Q x ⟶ R x) required by the conclusion.\n\nImprovement: Modify the proof to use the \"show\" command to explicitly derive the implication structure (P x ⟶ Q x ⟶ R x) before concluding with \"qed\".\n```\n\nThe current proof correctly establishes R x given P x and Q x, but it doesn't explicitly show the implication structure required by the conclusion. To improve the proof:\n\n1. After deriving \"R x\", we should use the \"show\" command to explicitly state the goal we're trying to prove: \"P x ⟶ Q x ⟶ R x\".\n\n2. We can use the \"proof\" command to start a nested proof for this implication.\n\n3. Inside this nested proof, we can assume P x and Q x, then use the already derived R x to complete the proof.\n\n4. This approach will make the logical structure of the proof more explicit and align it more closely with the goal statement.\n\nThese adjustments should help resolve the current issue and successfully complete the proof of the theorem.",
