    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem forall_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves universal quantification and implications.\n   - We need to prove that for all x, if P(x) and Q(x) are true, then R(x) is true.\n\n2. Identify the given assumption:\n   - We have: ∀x. (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) → R(x)\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the \"prove\" method to start the proof.\n   - Introduce an arbitrary but fixed x using \"fix\" command.\n   - Assume the antecedents P(x) and Q(x) using \"assume\" command.\n   - Show that R(x) follows from these assumptions.\n\n4. Utilize the assumption:\n   - Apply the assumption to the fixed x we introduced.\n   - Use the assumed P(x) and Q(x) to satisfy the antecedent of the assumption.\n\n5. Complete the proof:\n   - Once R(x) is derived, use \"show\" to conclude the implication.\n   - The universal quantification will be automatically handled by the \"fix\" step.\n\n6. Potential proof techniques:\n   - Use introduction rules for implications and conjunctions.\n   - Apply elimination rules as necessary.\n   - Consider using the \"erule\" tactic to eliminate the universal quantifier in the assumption.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure all assumptions are used.\n   - Check that the proof follows logically from the given assumption to the conclusion.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, focusing on breaking down the universal quantification and working with the implications in a step-by-step manner.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is generally correct, but we need to explicitly show the implication structure required by the conclusion. Here's how we should proceed:\n\n1. Keep the existing proof structure up to the point where we derive \"R x\".\n\n2. After deriving \"R x\", we need to explicitly show the goal in its full form:\n   show \"P x ⟶ Q x ⟶ R x\"\n\n3. To prove this implication, we should use a nested proof:\n   proof\n     assume \"P x\"\n     show \"Q x ⟶ R x\"\n     proof\n       assume \"Q x\"\n       from `R x` show \"R x\" .\n     qed\n   qed\n\n4. This nested proof structure explicitly shows how we derive the double implication (P x ⟶ Q x ⟶ R x) from the fact that R x holds when both P x and Q x are true.\n\n5. After this nested proof, we can conclude the overall proof with 'qed'.\n\nThis approach should resolve the current issue by explicitly deriving the required implication structure, which aligns with the goal statement and completes the proof successfully.\n",
