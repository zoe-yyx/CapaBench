    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to be proved is \"iff_refl: P ↔ P\"\n   - This is a basic logical equivalence stating that any proposition P is equivalent to itself\n   - The ↔ symbol represents logical equivalence (if and only if)\n\n2. Identify the Proof Strategy:\n   - For ↔ statements, we typically need to prove both directions\n   - In this case, both directions are identical due to the reflexive nature of the statement\n   - We can use the introduction rule for ↔ to split the proof into two parts\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof\n   b. Apply the introduction rule for ↔\n   c. Prove P → P for the forward direction\n   d. Prove P → P for the backward direction (which is identical to the forward direction)\n   e. Conclude the proof\n\n4. Consider Potential Tactics:\n   - intro: to introduce the ↔ and → operators\n   - assumption: since P implies itself trivially\n   - rule: to apply specific inference rules if needed\n\n5. Prepare for Potential Challenges:\n   - This proof should be straightforward, but be ready to explain each step clearly\n   - Emphasize the reflexive nature of logical equivalence\n\n6. Plan for Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, check that Isabelle accepts it without errors\n   - Ensure that the proof is as concise and clear as possible\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem \"iff_refl: P ↔ P\", our first step should be to start the proof and apply the introduction rule for the ↔ (if and only if) operator. This will set up the structure for proving both directions of the equivalence.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to prove that P implies P and P implies P (which are identical in this case).\n2. The ↔ introduction rule will split our goal into two subgoals, each representing one direction of the implication.\n3. After applying this rule, we'll be in a position to prove each direction separately, which should be trivial given that P implies itself.\n\nTherefore, I recommend starting the proof and immediately applying the ↔ introduction rule. This can typically be done using the 'apply' command with an appropriate rule for ↔ introduction in Isabelle.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt used Unicode symbols (⟷) which are not recognized by Isabelle in this context, leading to a lexical error.\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode symbol ⟷ with the ASCII equivalent \\<longleftrightarrow> to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's syntax.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt was on the right track in terms of structure and logic, but it encountered a technical issue due to the use of Unicode symbols. Isabelle often requires ASCII representations for logical symbols in theorem statements and proofs.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the theorem statement using ASCII symbols: \"P \\<longleftrightarrow> P\" instead of \"P ⟷ P\".\n2. Maintain the same proof structure, as it was correct logically.\n3. Ensure all logical symbols in the proof body also use ASCII representations if necessary.\n4. Double-check the syntax of Isabelle commands (e.g., 'theorem', 'proof', 'qed') to ensure they are correctly spelled and used.\n\nThe overall approach of proving both directions of the equivalence is correct for an iff statement. The use of 'assume' and 'show' commands in the proof was also appropriate. By making these adjustments, particularly focusing on using ASCII symbols, the proof should proceed without lexical errors and successfully demonstrate the reflexivity of the iff relation.",
