    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to be proved is \"iff_refl: P ↔ P\"\n   - This is a basic logical equivalence stating that any proposition P is equivalent to itself\n   - The ↔ symbol represents logical equivalence (if and only if)\n\n2. Identify the Proof Strategy:\n   - For ↔ statements, we typically need to prove both directions\n   - In this case, both directions are identical due to the reflexive nature of the statement\n   - We can use the introduction rule for ↔ to split the proof into two parts\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof\n   b. Apply the introduction rule for ↔\n   c. Prove P → P for the forward direction\n   d. Prove P → P for the backward direction (which is identical to the forward direction)\n   e. Conclude the proof\n\n4. Consider Potential Tactics:\n   - intro: to introduce the ↔ and → operators\n   - assumption: since P implies itself trivially\n   - rule: to apply specific inference rules if needed\n\n5. Prepare for Potential Challenges:\n   - This proof should be straightforward, but be ready to explain each step clearly\n   - Emphasize the reflexive nature of logical equivalence\n\n6. Plan for Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, check that Isabelle accepts it without errors\n   - Ensure that the proof is as concise and clear as possible\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and reflection, the reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. The proof structure we've attempted is logically correct for the theorem iff_refl: \"P ↔ P\". The use of 'rule iffI' to split the goal into both directions, followed by 'assumption' in each case, is the appropriate approach.\n\n2. The failure we're seeing is not due to a flaw in the proof itself, but rather an external issue with Isabelle's database access. This is evident from the error message mentioning \"SQLITE_READONLY_DBMOVED\" and \"attempt to write a readonly database\".\n\n3. Before we can proceed with the actual proof, we need to address this external issue. The acting agent should focus on:\n\n   a. Verifying that Isabelle has the necessary permissions to write to its database files.\n   b. Checking if the Isabelle environment is correctly set up and all necessary components are accessible.\n   c. Restarting the Isabelle environment to ensure a clean state.\n\n4. Once the environment issues are resolved, we should retry the exact same proof structure as it is logically correct for proving P ↔ P.\n\n5. If the problem persists after addressing the environment issues, consider trying the proof in a different Isabelle instance or environment to isolate whether the issue is specific to the current setup.\n\n6. The proof itself does not need modification. When the environment is properly set up, the current proof structure should successfully demonstrate that P implies P and vice versa, which is the essence of the iff_refl theorem.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to address the Isabelle environment issues rather than modifying the proof itself.\n",
