    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to be proved is \"iff_refl: P ↔ P\"\n   - This is a basic logical equivalence stating that any proposition P is equivalent to itself\n   - The ↔ symbol represents logical equivalence (if and only if)\n\n2. Identify the Proof Strategy:\n   - For ↔ statements, we typically need to prove both directions\n   - In this case, both directions are identical due to the reflexive nature of the statement\n   - We can use the introduction rule for ↔ to split the proof into two parts\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof\n   b. Apply the introduction rule for ↔\n   c. Prove P → P for the forward direction\n   d. Prove P → P for the backward direction (which is identical to the forward direction)\n   e. Conclude the proof\n\n4. Consider Potential Tactics:\n   - intro: to introduce the ↔ and → operators\n   - assumption: since P implies itself trivially\n   - rule: to apply specific inference rules if needed\n\n5. Prepare for Potential Challenges:\n   - This proof should be straightforward, but be ready to explain each step clearly\n   - Emphasize the reflexive nature of logical equivalence\n\n6. Plan for Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, check that Isabelle accepts it without errors\n   - Ensure that the proof is as concise and clear as possible\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt was structurally correct but encountered a lexical error due to the use of Unicode symbols. To resolve this issue and proceed with the proof:\n\n1. Rewrite the theorem statement using ASCII symbols:\n   Replace \"P ⟷ P\" with \"P \\<longleftrightarrow> P\"\n\n2. Maintain the same proof structure, as it was logically correct:\n   - Use 'proof' to start the proof\n   - Prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Use 'assume' and 'show' for each direction\n   - Use 'by assumption' to complete each part\n   - End with 'qed'\n\n3. Ensure all commands and symbols in the proof body use correct Isabelle syntax:\n   - 'theorem' for stating the theorem\n   - 'proof' to begin the proof\n   - 'assume' for assumptions\n   - 'show' for conclusions\n   - 'qed' to end the proof\n\n4. The proof can be streamlined using the 'rule' tactic with 'iffI', which is the introduction rule for iff statements. This approach can make the proof more concise and elegant.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the proof should proceed without lexical errors and successfully demonstrate the reflexivity of the iff relation.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the 'rule iffI' tactic was not applied successfully, leading to an incomplete proof.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'rule iffI' tactic and use a more explicit proof structure with 'show' statements for both directions of the iff relation.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt was structurally correct and used the appropriate ASCII symbols for the iff relation (\\<longleftrightarrow>). However, the use of the 'rule iffI' tactic did not successfully set up the proof as intended. This could be due to the specific implementation of the iffI rule in the current Isabelle environment or a subtle issue with how it's being applied.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should take a more explicit approach:\n\n1. Start the proof without specifying a rule.\n2. Use 'show' statements to explicitly state both directions of the iff relation.\n3. Prove each direction separately using basic logic.\n4. Use 'assumption' or other basic tactics to complete each part of the proof.\n\nThis approach will be more verbose but should be more robust and easier to verify. It will also give us more control over each step of the proof, allowing us to address any issues that arise more precisely.\n\nFor the next attempt, the LLM agent responsible for acting should implement this more explicit proof structure. This will help ensure that each step of the proof is clearly stated and easily verifiable, leading to a successful demonstration of the reflexivity of the iff relation.",
