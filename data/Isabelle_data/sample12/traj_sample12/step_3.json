Understand the problem structure:\n   - Analyze the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Review the definitions of tree_example2b and tree_example3b\n   - Examine the tree_size function\n\n2. Break down the main theorem:\n   - Focus on proving \"tree_size tree_example3b = 5\"\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Unfold the definition of tree_example3b\n   - Further unfold the definition of tree_example2b within tree_example3b\n\n4. Apply the tree_size function:\n   - Use the recursive definition of tree_size on the expanded tree structure\n\n5. Simplify expressions:\n   - Evaluate tree_size for Leaf nodes (which equal 0)\n   - Sum up the results for internal nodes\n\n6. Perform arithmetic:\n   - Add up all the +1 contributions from internal nodes\n   - Verify that the total sum equals 5\n\n7. Use Isabelle's automation:\n   - Apply simp or auto tactics to handle routine calculations\n\n8. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the final result matches the theorem statement\n\n9. Refine if necessary:\n   - If automation doesn't complete the proof, consider manual steps or lemmas\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe persistent syntax error in the tree_size function definition is preventing the theory file from parsing correctly. To resolve this issue and proceed with the proof, we need to take the following steps:\n\n1. Correct the arrow symbol: Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"â‡’\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"\\<Rightarrow>\" in the tree_size function definition. The corrected line should look like this:\n\n   fun tree_size :: \"tree \\<Rightarrow> int\" where\n\n2. Verify the change: After making this correction, display the updated function definition to ensure the change has been applied correctly.\n\n3. Run the theory file: Attempt to process the theory file again to confirm that the syntax error has been resolved.\n\n4. If successful, proceed with the proof: Once the syntax error is fixed, we can move forward with expanding definitions and applying the tree_size function to prove the theorem.\n\n5. If errors persist: Carefully review the entire theory file for any other potential syntax issues, paying close attention to special symbols and their correct Isabelle representations.\n\nBy addressing this fundamental syntax issue, we can ensure that Isabelle can parse the theory file correctly, allowing us to focus on the actual proof steps for the treeexample3b_size theorem.\n",
