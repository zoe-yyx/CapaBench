Understand the problem structure:\n   - Analyze the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Review the definitions of tree_example2b and tree_example3b\n   - Examine the tree_size function\n\n2. Break down the main theorem:\n   - Focus on proving \"tree_size tree_example3b = 5\"\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Unfold the definition of tree_example3b\n   - Further unfold the definition of tree_example2b within tree_example3b\n\n4. Apply the tree_size function:\n   - Use the recursive definition of tree_size on the expanded tree structure\n\n5. Simplify expressions:\n   - Evaluate tree_size for Leaf nodes (which equal 0)\n   - Sum up the results for internal nodes\n\n6. Perform arithmetic:\n   - Add up all the +1 contributions from internal nodes\n   - Verify that the total sum equals 5\n\n7. Use Isabelle's automation:\n   - Apply simp or auto tactics to handle routine calculations\n\n8. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the final result matches the theorem statement\n\n9. Refine if necessary:\n   - If automation doesn't complete the proof, consider manual steps or lemmas\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a syntax error in the type declaration of the tree_size function. This error is preventing Isabelle from parsing the theory file correctly, which in turn is blocking the execution of our proof. To address this, we need to:\n\n1. Correct the arrow symbol in the tree_size function definition:\n   Replace \"⇒\" with \"⇒\" (Unicode: \\<Rightarrow>)\n\n2. Keep the rest of the proof structure intact:\n   The logical steps in the proof appear to be correct and well-structured. Once the syntax error is fixed, we should be able to execute the proof as is.\n\n3. Re-run the entire proof:\n   After making the correction, we should attempt to run the entire proof again without any other changes.\n\n4. Watch for any additional syntax issues:\n   While this is likely the only syntax error, we should be vigilant for any other potential Unicode or syntax issues that might arise.\n\n5. Focus on proof execution:\n   Assuming the syntax error is the only issue, our next focus should be on ensuring the proof executes correctly and verifies the theorem.\n\nThe acting agent should make this small but crucial change to the function definition and then proceed with running the proof. If successful, we can move on to verifying the proof's correctness. If any other issues arise, we'll need to address them step by step.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists due to the incorrect arrow symbol in the tree_size function definition, preventing the theory file from parsing correctly.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"\\<Rightarrow>\" in the tree_size function definition to resolve the syntax error and allow the proof to proceed.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that despite our previous intention to correct the arrow symbol, the error still exists in the code. This indicates that the acting agent may have overlooked this crucial change or encountered issues implementing it.\n\nTo improve the process moving forward:\n\n1. Double-check implementations: Ensure that all suggested changes, especially those addressing syntax errors, are correctly implemented before proceeding.\n\n2. Use explicit Unicode representations: Instead of relying on the correct display of Unicode characters, use the explicit Isabelle representation \"\\<Rightarrow>\" for the arrow symbol to avoid potential encoding issues.\n\n3. Verify changes: After making syntax corrections, the acting agent should verify that the changes have been applied correctly, possibly by displaying the updated function definition.\n\n4. Incremental testing: Run the theory file after making syntax corrections to ensure that the basic structure is accepted before proceeding with the full proof.\n\n5. Error message focus: Pay close attention to the specific location and nature of errors reported by Isabelle, addressing them systematically.\n\nBy focusing on these points, we can ensure that fundamental syntax issues are resolved, allowing us to move forward with the actual proof steps and theorem verification.",
