Understand the problem structure:\n   - Analyze the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Review the definitions of tree_example2b and tree_example3b\n   - Examine the tree_size function\n\n2. Break down the main theorem:\n   - Focus on proving \"tree_size tree_example3b = 5\"\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Unfold the definition of tree_example3b\n   - Further unfold the definition of tree_example2b within tree_example3b\n\n4. Apply the tree_size function:\n   - Use the recursive definition of tree_size on the expanded tree structure\n\n5. Simplify expressions:\n   - Evaluate tree_size for Leaf nodes (which equal 0)\n   - Sum up the results for internal nodes\n\n6. Perform arithmetic:\n   - Add up all the +1 contributions from internal nodes\n   - Verify that the total sum equals 5\n\n7. Use Isabelle's automation:\n   - Apply simp or auto tactics to handle routine calculations\n\n8. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the final result matches the theorem statement\n\n9.

    "reasoning": "\n1. The proof structure and logical steps appear to be correct and complete. The historical actions show a well-constructed proof that correctly expands definitions, applies the tree_size function, and performs the necessary calculations.\n\n2. The current observation indicates an SQLite constraint error, which is external to the proof itself. This suggests an issue with the Isabelle environment or its associated database, rather than a problem with the proof logic.\n\n3. To proceed, we need to focus on resolving the environmental issue rather than modifying the proof itself. The acting agent should:\n\n   a. Attempt to clear any existing session data for this theory, if possible.\n   b. Verify that the Isabelle installation is up-to-date and correctly configured.\n   c. Check for any conflicting session names that might be causing the unique constraint failure.\n   d. If the issue persists, consider restarting the Isabelle environment or, if necessary, reinstalling Isabelle.\n\n4. Once the environment issue is resolved, the existing proof should be sufficient to prove the theorem. The acting agent should attempt to rerun the proof without any modifications to the logical steps.\n\n5. If after resolving the environment issues the proof still doesn't process successfully, only then should we consider reviewing and potentially modifying the proof steps. However, based on the current information, the proof logic appears sound and complete.\n\n6. In the unlikely event that the proof needs modification after resolving the environment issues, we should focus on ensuring that each step is correctly processed by Isabelle, possibly by breaking down complex steps into smaller, more explicit steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof process encountered a lexical error due to the use of an incorrect arrow symbol in the type declaration of the tree_size function.\n\nImprovement: Replace the incorrect arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"⇒\" (Unicode: \\<Rightarrow>) in the type declaration of the tree_size function.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies not in the proof logic or structure, but in a syntax error in the function definition. The use of an incorrect arrow symbol is causing Isabelle to fail in parsing the type declaration.\n\nTo improve the outcome in the next round:\n\n1. The acting agent should carefully review and correct any Unicode symbols used in the code, ensuring they match Isabelle's expected syntax.\n\n2. Specifically, the tree_size function definition should be updated to:\n\n   ```\n   fun tree_size :: \"tree ⇒ int\" where\n   ```\n\n   Note the use of the correct arrow symbol \"⇒\" (Unicode: \\<Rightarrow>).\n\n3. After making this correction, the entire proof should be re-run without any other changes, as the logical structure of the proof appears sound.\n\n4. In future, when encountering parsing or lexical errors, the agents should pay close attention to the specific line and character where the error occurs, as these often point directly to syntax issues rather than logical problems in the proof.\n\n5. It may be helpful to use Isabelle-specific text editors or IDE plugins that can automatically insert the correct Unicode symbols, reducing the risk of such errors in the future.\n\nBy addressing this syntax issue, we should be able to proceed with the proof execution successfully in the next round.",
