    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1'\n   - Note that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - 'shift_up1' applies a function and then adds 1 to the result\n\n2. Expand the Theorem Statement:\n   - Rewrite the left side of the equation using the definitions\n   - This will involve nested function applications\n\n3. Simplification Strategy:\n   - Start by expanding the outer function (shift_up1)\n   - Then expand the inner function (plus_one)\n   - Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Begin the proof\n   - Use the 'unfolding' method to expand definitions\n   - Apply simplification rules to reduce the expression\n   - Show that the simplified left side equals the right side (x + 2)\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step of the simplification is correct\n   - Confirm that no steps are skipped in the reasoning\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - Finalize the proof by showing the equality holds\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to complete the proof\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Review the proof for any potential simplifications or more elegant approaches\n   - Ensure the proof is clear and follows logically from the definitions and theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure and content appear to be correct and complete. The error message we're seeing is not related to the proof itself, but rather to a database constraint issue in the Isabelle environment. This suggests that our focus should shift from modifying the proof to addressing the system-level problem.\n\nGiven that the proof itself looks sound, we should:\n\n1. Verify the Isabelle environment setup:\n   - Check if Isabelle is properly installed and up-to-date\n   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are met\n   - Verify there are no conflicts with other software or system settings\n\n2. Attempt to run the proof again without changes:\n   - Sometimes, transient errors can occur due to temporary system issues\n   - Running the proof again might resolve the issue if it was a one-time glitch\n\n3. If the error persists, try the following:\n   - Save the theory file\n   - Close and restart the Isabelle environment\n   - Reopen the theory file and attempt to run the proof again\n\n4. If the problem continues after these steps:\n   - Consider checking Isabelle's log files for more detailed error information\n   - Look for any recent changes to the system that might have affected Isabelle's database\n   - Consult Isabelle documentation or user forums for similar issues and potential solutions\n\n5. Regarding the proof itself:\n   - Keep the current proof structure as it is logically sound and well-organized\n   - No changes to the proof content are necessary at this point\n\nThe acting agent should focus on these system-level troubleshooting steps rather than modifying the proof content. If these steps do not resolve the issue, it may be necessary to seek assistance from Isabelle system administrators or the Isabelle community for more specialized help with the database constraint error.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof itself is correct, but an external database constraint error is preventing successful execution.\nImprovement: Focus on troubleshooting the Isabelle environment and database issues rather than modifying the proof content.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and content are logically sound and well-organized. The error we're encountering is not related to the proof itself, but rather to a database constraint issue in the Isabelle environment. This suggests that our efforts should be redirected towards addressing system-level problems rather than refining the proof.\n\nTo improve our approach in the next steps, we should:\n\n1. Verify the Isabelle environment setup, ensuring it's properly installed, up-to-date, and all dependencies are met.\n\n2. Attempt to run the proof again without changes, as the error might be a transient issue.\n\n3.

If the problem continues, seek assistance from Isabelle system administrators or the Isabelle community for specialized help with the database constraint error.\n\nBy focusing on these system-level troubleshooting steps, we can address the root cause of the error and potentially resolve the issue without modifying the proof content. This approach aligns better with our overall goal of successfully proving the problem, as the proof itself appears to be correct and complete.",
