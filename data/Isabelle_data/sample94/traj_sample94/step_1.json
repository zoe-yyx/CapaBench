    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1'\n   - Note that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - 'shift_up1' applies a function and then adds 1 to the result\n\n2. Expand the Theorem Statement:\n   - Rewrite the left side of the equation using the definitions\n   - This will involve nested function applications\n\n3. Simplification Strategy:\n   - Start by expanding the outer function (shift_up1)\n   - Then expand the inner function (plus_one)\n   - Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Begin the proof\n   - Use the 'unfolding' method to expand definitions\n   - Apply simplification rules to reduce the expression\n   - Show that the simplified left side equals the right side (x + 2)\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step of the simplification is correct\n   - Confirm that no steps are skipped in the reasoning\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - Finalize the proof by showing the equality holds\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to complete the proof\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Review the proof for any potential simplifications or more elegant approaches\n   - Ensure the proof is clear and follows logically from the definitions and theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a syntax error due to the use of unicode characters in the type definitions. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we need to modify the definitions to use ASCII symbols instead. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Replace all occurrences of the unicode arrow \"â‡’\" with the ASCII equivalent \"->\". This applies to both the 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1' definitions.\n\n2. Keep the overall structure of the definitions and the proof the same, as the logical approach is correct.\n\n3. After making these changes, attempt to run the proof again. The proof structure should remain as:\n   - Unfold the definition of shift_up1\n   - Unfold the definition of plus_one\n   - Simplify the resulting arithmetic expressions\n\n4. If the proof succeeds after these changes, it will confirm that the issue was indeed related to the use of unicode characters.\n\n5. If any further issues arise, they are likely to be related to the actual content of the proof rather than syntax, and we can address them accordingly.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on making these syntax corrections first, then attempt to run the proof again using the existing proof structure. This approach should resolve the current error and allow the proof to proceed.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists due to incorrect formatting of the arrow symbol in type definitions.\nImprovement: Remove the spaces around the arrow symbol in type definitions, changing \"int -> int\" to \"int->int\" for both 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1' definitions.\n```\n\nThe current thought correctly identified the need to replace unicode arrows with ASCII equivalents, but it didn't address the formatting issue that's causing the syntax error. The arrow symbol in type definitions should not have spaces around it.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. Modify the type definitions to use the correct format: \"int->int\" instead of \"int -> int\".\n2. Apply this change consistently in both 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1' definitions.\n3. Keep the proof structure as it is, since it appears logically sound.\n4. After making these changes, attempt to run the proof again.\n\nThese adjustments should resolve the syntax error and allow the proof to proceed. If successful, it will confirm that the issue was related to the formatting of type definitions. If any further issues arise, they are likely to be related to the actual content of the proof, and we can address them in subsequent iterations.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on making these specific formatting corrections before attempting to run the proof again. This approach should resolve the current error and allow the proof to progress.",
