    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1'\n   - Note that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - 'shift_up1' applies a function and then adds 1 to the result\n\n2. Expand the Theorem Statement:\n   - Rewrite the left side of the equation using the definitions\n   - This will involve nested function applications\n\n3. Simplification Strategy:\n   - Start by expanding the outer function (shift_up1)\n   - Then expand the inner function (plus_one)\n   - Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Begin the proof\n   - Use the 'unfolding' method to expand definitions\n   - Apply simplification rules to reduce the expression\n   - Show that the simplified left side equals the right side (x + 2)\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step of the simplification is correct\n   - Confirm that no steps are skipped in the reasoning\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - Finalize the proof by showing the equality holds\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to complete the proof\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Review the proof for any potential simplifications or more elegant approaches\n   - Ensure the proof is clear and follows logically from the definitions and theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is a syntax issue in the type definitions. To resolve this, we need to adjust the formatting of the arrow symbol in the type definitions for both 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1'. The correct format should be \"int->int\" without spaces around the arrow.\n\nReasoning steps:\n1. Modify the 'plus_one' definition:\n   Change \"int -> int\" to \"int->int\"\n\n2. Modify the 'shift_up1' definition:\n   Change \"(int -> int) -> int -> int\" to \"(int->int)->int->int\"\n\n3. Keep the rest of the proof structure intact, as it appears logically sound.\n\n4. After making these changes, attempt to run the proof again.\n\nThis adjustment should resolve the syntax error and allow the proof to proceed. If successful, it will confirm that the issue was related to the formatting of type definitions. If any further issues arise after this change, they are likely to be related to the actual content of the proof, and we can address them in subsequent iterations.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on making these specific formatting corrections to the type definitions before attempting to run the proof again. This approach should resolve the current error and allow the proof to progress.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The error message indicates a database constraint issue, which is unrelated to the proof itself and likely a system-level problem.\nImprovement: We should focus on the actual proof content and structure, as the current proof appears logically sound and syntactically correct.\n```\n\nBased on this reflection, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. The error message seems to be related to a database constraint issue, which is likely a problem with the Isabelle environment or setup rather than with our proof.\n\n2. Our previous actions successfully addressed the syntax issues in the type definitions, and the proof structure looks correct and complete.\n\n3. For the next steps, we should:\n   a) Verify that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and functioning.\n   b) If the environment check passes, try to run the proof again without changes, as the current proof structure appears correct.\n   c) If the error persists, consider saving the theory file and restarting the Isabelle environment before attempting to run the proof again.\n\n4. If after these steps the problem still occurs, we may need to seek assistance from someone familiar with Isabelle's system administration, as the error seems to be at the database level rather than in the proof itself.\n\n5. In terms of the proof content, we should maintain our current approach as it appears logically sound and well-structured. The proof correctly unfolds the definitions, applies simplification, and reaches the desired conclusion.\n\nMoving forward, we should focus on resolving the system-level issue while keeping the current proof structure intact, as it seems to be a correct approach to proving the target theorem.",
