    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the lemma \"shift_up1_plus_one: shift_up1 plus_one x = x + 2\", we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. Start by unfolding the definitions of both 'shift_up1' and 'plus_one'. This will allow us to work directly with the underlying expressions.\n\n2. After unfolding, the left side of the equation will become more complex, but it will be in a form that we can simplify step by step.\n\n3. The unfolded expression should look like this:\n   shift_up1 plus_one x = (plus_one x) + 1\n   \n   Which, when fully expanded, becomes:\n   ((x + 1) + 1)\n\n4. We can then simplify this arithmetic expression:\n   ((x + 1) + 1) = (x + 2)\n\n5. The right side of our original equation is already in the form (x + 2), so once we've simplified the left side, we should have equality.\n\n6. To carry out this proof in Isabelle, we should use the 'unfolding' method to expand the definitions, followed by the 'simp' method to perform the arithmetic simplification.\n\n7. If any intermediate steps are needed, we can use the 'have' command to state and prove them.\n\n8. Finally, we should be able to conclude the proof with 'done' or 'by simp' if the simplifier can handle the final equality check automatically.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the acting agent should start by unfolding the definitions and then proceed with simplification steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type definition, specifically with the arrow symbol \"⇒\".\n\nImprovement: Replace the unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"->\" in type definitions to ensure compatibility and avoid lexical errors.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is that the Isabelle parser encountered a problem with the unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" used in the type definitions. This suggests that the current environment or configuration might not support unicode characters in theory files.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. We should modify the type definitions to use the ASCII arrow \"->\" instead of the unicode \"⇒\". This change should be applied to both the 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1' definitions.\n\n2. After making these changes, we should attempt to run the proof again. The reasoning and proof structure appear to be correct, so once the syntax issue is resolved, the proof should proceed successfully.\n\n3. For future proofs, we should consistently use ASCII symbols unless we're certain that unicode is supported and properly configured in the Isabelle environment being used.\n\n4. It might be helpful to add a comment at the beginning of the theory file specifying which character set (ASCII or unicode) is being used, to prevent similar issues in the future.\n\n5. The overall approach to the proof remains valid, so we can maintain the same logical steps once the syntax is corrected.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and successfully prove the lemma.",
