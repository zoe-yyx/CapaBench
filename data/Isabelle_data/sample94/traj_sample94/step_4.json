    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1'\n   - Note that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - 'shift_up1' applies a function and then adds 1 to the result\n\n2. Expand the Theorem Statement:\n   - Rewrite the left side of the equation using the definitions\n   - This will involve nested function applications\n\n3. Simplification Strategy:\n   - Start by expanding the outer function (shift_up1)\n   - Then expand the inner function (plus_one)\n   - Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Begin the proof\n   - Use the 'unfolding' method to expand definitions\n   - Apply simplification rules to reduce the expression\n   - Show that the simplified left side equals the right side (x + 2)\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step of the simplification is correct\n   - Confirm that no steps are skipped in the reasoning\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - Finalize the proof by showing the equality holds\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics to complete the proof\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Review the proof for any potential simplifications or more elegant approaches\n   - Ensure the proof is clear and follows logically from the definitions and theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof itself appears to be correct and complete. The error we're encountering is not related to the proof content but to a database constraint issue in the Isabelle environment. Therefore, our next steps should focus on resolving this technical issue rather than modifying the proof.\n\nReasoning for the next action:\n\n1. The proof structure is logically sound and follows the planned strategy effectively.\n2. All necessary definitions have been unfolded and simplifications applied correctly.\n3. The final equality (x + 2) has been established as required by the theorem.\n4. The error message indicates a PRIMARY KEY constraint failure in the SQLite database used by Isabelle.\n\nGiven these observations, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Attempt to run the proof again without any changes, as the error might be transient.\n2. If the error persists, save the theory file, close and restart the Isabelle environment, then reopen the file and run the proof again.\n3. Check Isabelle's log files for more detailed error information.\n4. If the issue continues, consider seeking assistance from Isabelle system administrators or the Isabelle community to resolve the database constraint error.\n\nThe focus should be on troubleshooting the Isabelle environment rather than modifying the proof content, as the proof itself appears to be correct and complete.\n",
