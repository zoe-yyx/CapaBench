    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_comm theorem:\n\n1. Recognize the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the commutativity of addition for our custom natural number type (mynat).\n   - We need to show that myadd n m = myadd m n for all n and m of type mynat.\n\n2. Analyze Available Resources:\n   - We have the definition of myadd function.\n   - Two lemmas are already proven: myadd_0_r and myadd_succ_r.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Use induction on one of the variables (let's choose n).\n   b. For the base case (n = MyZero), use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r.\n   c. For the inductive case (n = MySuc n'), use the inductive hypothesis and lemma myadd_succ_r.\n\n4. Detailed Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof (induction n)\"\n   b. Base case (MyZero):\n      - Show that myadd MyZero m = myadd m MyZero\n      - Use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r\n   c. Inductive case (MySuc n):\n      - Assume the hypothesis holds for n\n      - Show that myadd (MySuc n) m = myadd m (MySuc n)\n      - Use the definition of myadd, inductive hypothesis, and lemma myadd_succ_r\n\n5. Finalize the Proof:\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics (e.g., simp, auto) to simplify and solve each case.\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete.\n\n6. Verify and Refine:\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any errors.\n   - If any issues arise, revisit the problematic steps and adjust the proof accordingly.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the add_comm theorem, our first step should be to set up the induction framework. The planning strategy suggests using induction on one of the variables, specifically n.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should start the proof by applying induction on n. This will create two cases for us to prove: the base case (MyZero) and the inductive case (MySuc n).\n\n2. Using induction on n is a good choice because:\n   a. It aligns with the structure of the myadd function definition.\n   b. It will allow us to leverage the already proven lemmas, particularly myadd_0_r for the base case.\n\n3. After setting up the induction, we'll need to prove each case separately. The base case should be relatively straightforward using the myadd_0_r lemma, while the inductive case will require more complex reasoning using the myadd_succ_r lemma and the induction hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin the proof by applying induction on n. This can be done using the command:\n\nproof (induction n)\n\nThis will set up the framework for our inductive proof and allow us to proceed with proving each case individually in subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function, specifically with the arrow symbol used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"⇒\" in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function to resolve the lexical error and allow the proof to proceed.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current unsatisfactory result is due to a syntax error in the function definition, rather than an issue with the proof strategy itself. The use of an incorrect arrow symbol is causing Isabelle to fail in parsing the type declaration.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should carefully review and correct the syntax in the theory file, particularly focusing on replacing any non-standard symbols with their correct Isabelle counterparts.\n\n2. After fixing the syntax error, the proof strategy of using induction on 'n' for the add_comm theorem remains valid and should be pursued.\n\n3. Once the syntax is corrected, the proof outline can be filled in as originally planned, starting with the base case and then proceeding to the inductive step.\n\n4. Extra attention should be paid to ensure all symbols and syntax in the entire theory file are correct to prevent similar errors in future steps.\n\n5. If similar errors occur in the future, it would be beneficial to implement a pre-processing step to check for and correct common syntax issues before attempting to prove theorems.\n\nBy addressing this syntax issue, we can proceed with the proof strategy as originally intended, focusing on the mathematical reasoning required to prove the commutativity of addition for our custom natural number type.",
