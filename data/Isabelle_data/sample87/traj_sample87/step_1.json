    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_comm theorem:\n\n1. Recognize the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the commutativity of addition for our custom natural number type (mynat).\n   - We need to show that myadd n m = myadd m n for all n and m of type mynat.\n\n2. Analyze Available Resources:\n   - We have the definition of myadd function.\n   - Two lemmas are already proven: myadd_0_r and myadd_succ_r.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Use induction on one of the variables (let's choose n).\n   b. For the base case (n = MyZero), use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r.\n   c. For the inductive case (n = MySuc n'), use the inductive hypothesis and lemma myadd_succ_r.\n\n4. Detailed Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof (induction n)\"\n   b. Base case (MyZero):\n      - Show that myadd MyZero m = myadd m MyZero\n      - Use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r\n   c. Inductive case (MySuc n):\n      - Assume the hypothesis holds for n\n      - Show that myadd (MySuc n) m = myadd m (MySuc n)\n      - Use the definition of myadd, inductive hypothesis, and lemma myadd_succ_r\n\n5. Finalize the Proof:\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics (e.g., simp, auto) to simplify and solve each case.\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete.\n\n6. Verify and Refine:\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any errors.\n   - If any issues arise, revisit the problematic steps and adjust the proof accordingly.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The immediate priority is to correct the syntax error in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function. The acting agent should replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol \"⇒\" in the function definition.\n\n2. Verification:\n   After correcting the syntax, the acting agent should attempt to load the theory file again to ensure that the lexical error has been resolved and no other syntax issues remain.\n\n3. Proceed with Proof:\n   Assuming the syntax error is resolved, we can proceed with the proof of the add_comm theorem as originally planned. The induction strategy on 'n' is still valid and should be implemented.\n\n4. Base Case:\n   For the base case (n = MyZero), the acting agent should focus on showing that:\n   myadd MyZero m = myadd m MyZero\n   This can be done by using the definition of myadd and the lemma myadd_0_r.\n\n5. Inductive Step:\n   For the inductive step (n = MySuc n'), the acting agent should:\n   a. Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n' m = myadd m n'\n   b. Show that: myadd (MySuc n') m = myadd m (MySuc n')\n   This can be accomplished using the definition of myadd, the inductive hypothesis, and the lemma myadd_succ_r.\n\n6. Simplification:\n   Throughout the proof, the acting agent should use appropriate Isabelle tactics such as 'simp' or 'auto' to simplify expressions and complete each step of the proof.\n\n7. Verification:\n   After completing each step, the acting agent should verify that Isabelle accepts the proof without errors. If any issues arise, they should be addressed immediately before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt timed out, possibly due to insufficient detail or complexity in the inductive step.\n\nImprovement: Expand the inductive step by explicitly showing how myadd (MySuc n) m equals myadd m (MySuc n) using the inductive hypothesis and lemmas, rather than relying solely on simplification.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt for the add_comm theorem appears to have timed out, which suggests that the simplification tactics alone were not sufficient to complete the proof within the allocated time. This is likely because the inductive step requires more explicit reasoning and intermediate steps.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Keep the base case as it is, since it seems to be correct and sufficiently simple.\n\n2. For the inductive step, instead of relying solely on simplification with myadd_succ_r, we should explicitly show the equality:\n   myadd (MySuc n) m = MySuc (myadd n m) = MySuc (myadd m n) = myadd m (MySuc n)\n\n3. Use the inductive hypothesis (IH) explicitly in the proof to justify the equality myadd n m = myadd m n.\n\n4. Apply the lemmas myadd_succ_r and myadd_0_r strategically, showing each step of the transformation.\n\n5. Use more basic Isabelle tactics like 'have', 'also', and 'finally' to guide the proof assistant through each step of the reasoning process.\n\n6. Consider breaking down complex steps into smaller, more manageable sub-goals if necessary.\n\nBy providing a more detailed and step-by-step proof for the inductive case, we increase the likelihood of the proof being completed within the time limit and give Isabelle more explicit guidance in verifying the theorem's validity.",
