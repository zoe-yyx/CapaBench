    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_comm theorem:\n\n1. Recognize the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the commutativity of addition for our custom natural number type (mynat).\n   - We need to show that myadd n m = myadd m n for all n and m of type mynat.\n\n2. Analyze Available Resources:\n   - We have the definition of myadd function.\n   - Two lemmas are already proven: myadd_0_r and myadd_succ_r.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Use induction on one of the variables (let's choose n).\n   b. For the base case (n = MyZero), use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r.\n   c. For the inductive case (n = MySuc n'), use the inductive hypothesis and lemma myadd_succ_r.\n\n4. Detailed Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof (induction n)\"\n   b. Base case (MyZero):\n      - Show that myadd MyZero m = myadd m MyZero\n      - Use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r\n   c. Inductive case (MySuc n):\n      - Assume the hypothesis holds for n\n      - Show that myadd (MySuc n) m = myadd m (MySuc n)\n      - Use the definition of myadd, inductive hypothesis, and lemma myadd_succ_r\n\n5. Finalize the Proof:\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics (e.g., simp, auto) to simplify and solve each case.\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete.\n\n6. Verify and Refine:\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any errors.\n   - If any issues arise, revisit the problematic steps and adjust the proof accordingly.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. The base case (MyZero) appears to be correct and should be kept as is.\n\n2. For the inductive case (MySuc n), we need to provide a more detailed proof instead of relying solely on simplification. Here's the reasoning structure we should follow:\n\n   a. Start with the left-hand side: myadd (MySuc n) m\n   b. Use the definition of myadd to rewrite this as: MySuc (myadd n m)\n   c. Apply the inductive hypothesis to transform (myadd n m) to (myadd m n)\n   d. Use the lemma myadd_succ_r to rewrite MySuc (myadd m n) as myadd m (MySuc n)\n\n3. Each step should be explicitly stated and justified using appropriate Isabelle tactics such as 'have', 'also', and 'finally'.\n\n4. The proof should conclude by showing that we've transformed myadd (MySuc n) m into myadd m (MySuc n), thus proving the equality for the inductive case.\n\n5. Use the 'show' command to explicitly state the goal we're proving in each case.\n\nBy following this reasoning structure, we provide a clear path for the acting agent to construct a more detailed and explicit proof, which should help overcome the timeout issue and successfully prove the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function, specifically with the arrow symbols used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbols (⇒) with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol (=>) in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function to resolve the lexical error and allow the proof to proceed.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue is not with the proof strategy itself, but with a syntax error in the function definition. The use of non-standard arrow symbols (⇒) instead of the correct Isabelle arrow symbol (=>) is causing the lexical error.\n\nTo improve in the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should carefully review and correct any syntax issues, particularly focusing on using the correct symbols for Isabelle.\n\n2. Double-check all function and type declarations to ensure they use standard Isabelle syntax.\n\n3. After correcting the syntax error, the proof structure and reasoning appear sound, so the same proof strategy can be attempted again.\n\n4. In future proofs, pay extra attention to the correct use of Isabelle-specific symbols and syntax to avoid similar errors.\n\n5. Consider implementing a pre-processing step to catch and correct common syntax errors before submitting the proof to Isabelle.\n\nBy addressing this syntax issue, we should be able to proceed with the proof as planned, as the overall structure and reasoning of the proof appear to be correct.",
