    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_comm theorem:\n\n1. Recognize the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the commutativity of addition for our custom natural number type (mynat).\n   - We need to show that myadd n m = myadd m n for all n and m of type mynat.\n\n2. Analyze Available Resources:\n   - We have the definition of myadd function.\n   - Two lemmas are already proven: myadd_0_r and myadd_succ_r.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Use induction on one of the variables (let's choose n).\n   b. For the base case (n = MyZero), use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r.\n   c. For the inductive case (n = MySuc n'), use the inductive hypothesis and lemma myadd_succ_r.\n\n4. Detailed Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof (induction n)\"\n   b. Base case (MyZero):\n      - Show that myadd MyZero m = myadd m MyZero\n      - Use the definition of myadd and lemma myadd_0_r\n   c. Inductive case (MySuc n):\n      - Assume the hypothesis holds for n\n      - Show that myadd (MySuc n) m = myadd m (MySuc n)\n      - Use the definition of myadd, inductive hypothesis, and lemma myadd_succ_r\n\n5. Finalize the Proof:\n   - Use appropriate Isabelle tactics (e.g., simp, auto) to simplify and solve each case.\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete.\n\n6. Verify and Refine:\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Isabelle without any errors.\n   - If any issues arise, revisit the problematic steps and adjust the proof accordingly.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and reflection, the main issue is a syntax error in the function definition, not a problem with the proof strategy itself. Therefore, my reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. First and foremost, we need to correct the syntax error in the 'myadd' function definition. The arrow symbol used (â‡’) is causing a lexical error. We should replace these with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol (=>).\n\n2. Once this syntax error is corrected, we can proceed with the proof strategy as originally planned. The structure of the proof appears to be correct, using induction on 'n' and leveraging the previously proven lemmas.\n\n3. For the base case (MyZero), the proof using 'simp add: myadd_0_r' should be sufficient.\n\n4. For the inductive case (MySuc n), the chain of equations using 'also' and 'finally' is a good approach. It clearly shows the step-by-step reasoning from 'myadd (MySuc n) m' to 'myadd m (MySuc n)'.\n\n5. The use of the induction hypothesis (MySuc.IH) and the lemma myadd_succ_r in the inductive step is appropriate and should lead to a successful proof.\n\n6. After correcting the syntax and rerunning the proof, if any further issues arise, we may need to provide more detailed steps or use additional tactics to guide Isabelle through the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on correcting the syntax error in the function definition, then attempt to run the proof again with the existing structure. If successful, no further changes should be necessary. If issues persist, we may need to provide more detailed intermediate steps in the proof.\n",
