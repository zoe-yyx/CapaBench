    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem 'proj2' involves two boolean variables P and Q.\n   - We have an assumption H: \"P ∧ Q\" (P and Q).\n   - The goal is to prove Q.\n\n2. Identify the Key Concept:\n   - This problem is about logical conjunction (AND) and its properties.\n   - We need to extract the right-hand side of the conjunction.\n\n3. Plan the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the 'proof' command to begin the proof.\n   b. Use the assumption H directly, as it contains the information we need.\n   c. Apply a rule that allows us to eliminate the conjunction and focus on Q.\n   d. Once we have isolated Q, we can conclude the proof.\n\n4. Consider Potential Methods:\n   - The 'conjunct2' rule might be useful for extracting the second part of a conjunction.\n   - Alternatively, we could use the 'rule' method with 'conjE' (conjunction elimination).\n\n5. Prepare for Potential Challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to use basic logical rules if needed.\n   - If direct application of rules doesn't work, consider using 'cases' on the assumption H.\n\n6. Outline the Proof Structure:\n   - Begin with 'proof -'\n   - Use 'from H' to refer to the assumption\n   - Apply the chosen rule to extract Q\n   - Use 'show' to state the conclusion\n   - End with 'qed'\n\n7. Reflect on the Proof:\n   - This proof demonstrates a fundamental property of logical conjunction.\n   - It showcases how to use assumptions and basic logical rules in Isabelle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, our reasoning should focus on addressing the external error while maintaining the correct proof structure. Here's our reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. The proof itself is logically correct and concise. It correctly uses the assumption H and applies the 'conjunct2' rule to extract Q from P ∧ Q. This approach aligns perfectly with our initial planning strategy.\n\n2. The SQLite constraint error suggests an issue with the Isabelle environment or session management, not with the proof itself. This is likely preventing the successful execution and verification of our proof.\n\n3. Despite the error, we should maintain our current proof structure as it is theoretically sound. The acting agent should not modify the proof content at this stage.\n\n4. Instead, the acting agent should focus on resolving the database-related issue. This may involve:\n   a. Ensuring all previous Isabelle sessions are properly closed.\n   b. Clearing any existing session data that might be causing conflicts.\n   c. Verifying the uniqueness of the theory name and session setup.\n   d. Checking the Isabelle environment configuration, particularly related to SQLite database usage.\n\n5. Once the environmental issue is addressed, the acting agent should attempt to re-run the proof without any modifications to the logical structure.\n\n6. If the database issue persists after these steps, it may be necessary to seek technical support or consult Isabelle documentation for more advanced troubleshooting of SQLite-related problems.\n\n7. Throughout this process, it's crucial to maintain the integrity of the proof itself, as the logical reasoning and structure are correct. The focus should be on resolving the external constraint without altering the proof content.\n\nThis reasoning emphasizes the importance of addressing environmental issues while preserving the correct logical structure of the proof, aligning with our original planning strategy and the proven effectiveness of the chosen proof method.\n",
