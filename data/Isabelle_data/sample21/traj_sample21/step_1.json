    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem shift_left1_plus_one:\n\n1. Understanding the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of plus_one\n   - Analyze the definition of shift_left1\n   - Understand how these definitions interact\n\n2. Breakdown of the Theorem:\n   - Recognize that we need to prove: shift_left1 plus_one x = x + 2\n   - Identify that the left side involves applying shift_left1 to plus_one function\n\n3. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start by unfolding the definition of shift_left1\n   b. Then, unfold the definition of plus_one within the context of shift_left1\n   c. Simplify the resulting expression\n   d. Show that the simplified expression equals x + 2\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   - Use the 'apply' method with appropriate tactics:\n     1. unfold shift_left1_def\n     2. unfold plus_one_def\n     3. simplify the expression\n     4. prove equality\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous\n   - Confirm that the final step results in x + 2\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, focusing on unfolding definitions and simplifying expressions to reach the desired equality.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the observed issues and the reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next proving operation:\n\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The first step is to correct the syntax errors in the type definitions. Replace all instances of \"â‡’\" with \"=>\" in the theory file. This will resolve the lexical errors and allow Isabelle to parse the definitions correctly.\n\n2. Environment Check:\n   Before proceeding with the proof, ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and has the necessary permissions for database access. This may require checking file permissions or consulting with the system administrator.\n\n3. Proof Structure:\n   Once the syntax is corrected, we can focus on the proof itself. The current proof attempt is incomplete and relies on 'sorry'. We should structure the proof as follows:\n\n   a. Start by unfolding the definition of shift_left1 using the shift_left1_def.\n   b. Then, unfold the definition of plus_one using plus_one_def.\n   c. Use simplification tactics to reduce the expression.\n   d. Show that the resulting expression is equivalent to x + 2.\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   The proof can be constructed using the following steps:\n\n   lemma shift_left1_plus_one: \"shift_left1 plus_one x = x + 2\"\n   proof -\n     have \"shift_left1 plus_one x = plus_one (x + 1)\" by (simp add: shift_left1_def)\n     also have \"... = (x + 1) + 1\" by (simp add: plus_one_def)\n     also have \"... = x + 2\" by simp\n     finally show ?thesis .\n   qed\n\n   This proof structure unfolds the definitions step by step and uses simplification to reach the desired equality.\n\n5. Verification:\n   After implementing these steps, verify that each step follows logically from the previous one and that the final result matches the theorem statement.\n\nBy following this reasoning, we should be able to correctly define the functions and prove the theorem without relying on 'sorry' or encountering syntax errors.\n",
