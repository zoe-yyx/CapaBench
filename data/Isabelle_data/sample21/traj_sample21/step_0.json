    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem shift_left1_plus_one, we should follow the outlined proof strategy. The first step is to unfold the definition of shift_left1. This will allow us to see how the function is applied to plus_one and x.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We start by unfolding the definition of shift_left1 because it's the outermost function in our theorem statement.\n2. Unfolding shift_left1 will reveal its internal structure, which applies the function f (in this case, plus_one) to (x + 1).\n3. This step will transform the left side of our equation from \"shift_left1 plus_one x\" to \"plus_one (x + 1)\".\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin the proof by applying the unfold tactic to the shift_left1 definition. This will set the stage for the subsequent steps in our proof strategy.\n\nSuggested next action: Apply the unfold tactic to shift_left1_def.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered lexical errors due to incorrect symbol usage and database issues, preventing the theorem from being properly processed.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the correct Isabelle arrow \"=>\" in type definitions, and ensure the Isabelle environment is properly set up with correct permissions for database access.\n```\n\nThe current result is unsatisfactory due to several issues:\n\n1. Lexical error: The use of the symbol \"⇒\" in type definitions is causing parsing errors. This symbol needs to be replaced with the correct Isabelle arrow \"=>\".\n\n2. Database issues: The error messages indicate problems with database access, suggesting that there might be issues with the Isabelle environment setup or permissions.\n\n3. Incomplete proof: The use of 'sorry' in the proof indicates that the proof is not complete and rigorous.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. First and foremost, correct the type definitions by replacing \"⇒\" with \"=>\". This should resolve the lexical errors.\n\n2. Ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up, with correct permissions for database access. This may involve checking file permissions or reinstalling/reconfiguring Isabelle.\n\n3. Once the syntax errors are resolved, focus on completing the proof without using 'sorry'. This will involve expanding the definitions of both shift_left1 and plus_one, and then using simplification or rewriting tactics to show that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side.\n\n4. Consider breaking down the proof into smaller steps, using 'have' statements to establish intermediate results if necessary.\n\n5. Make use of the simp tactic with relevant definition additions (shift_left1_def and plus_one_def) to simplify expressions.\n\nBy addressing these issues and following a more structured proof approach, we should be able to successfully prove the theorem in the next attempt.",
