    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem not_forall:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that if it's not true that P holds for all x, then there exists an x for which P does not hold.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the not_exists theorem provided.\n\n2. Analyze available resources:\n   - We have access to the Main library.\n   - Two relevant theorems are provided: forall_iff and not_exists.\n   - The not_exists theorem seems particularly useful for this proof.\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with the assumption: ¬(∀x. P x)\n   b. Our goal is to prove: ∃x. ¬P x\n   c. We can use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume the negation of our goal: ¬(∃x. ¬P x)\n      - Use the not_exists theorem to transform this into: ∀x. ¬¬P x\n      - Simplify double negation: ∀x. P x\n      - This contradicts our initial assumption\n      - Therefore, our original goal must be true\n\n4. Implement the proof:\n   - Begin with the 'proof' command\n   - Use 'show ?thesis' to state our goal\n   - Employ proof by contradiction using 'proof (rule ccontr)'\n   - Apply the steps outlined in the strategy\n   - Use 'qed' to conclude the proof\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without errors\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the not_forall theorem, utilizing the provided theorems and basic logical principles.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt encountered a type mismatch error due to incorrectly treating the predicate P as a boolean. To address this issue and improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Maintain the overall structure of proof by contradiction (rule ccontr).\n2. After assuming the negation of our goal (\"\\<not> (\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x)\"), we need to carefully handle the double negation.\n3. Instead of directly applying the not_exists theorem, we should use basic logical rules to manipulate the quantifiers and negations.\n4. We can use the fact that \"\\<not> (\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x)\" is equivalent to \"\\<forall>x. \\<not> \\<not> P x\".\n5. Then, simplify \"\\<not> \\<not> P x\" to \"P x\" for all x using the double negation elimination principle.\n6. This will lead us to \"\\<forall>x. P x\", which directly contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps, using appropriate Isabelle tactics and rules for quantifier manipulation and simplification of negations. This approach should avoid type mismatches and correctly handle P as a predicate throughout the proof.\n",
