    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem not_forall:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that if it's not true that P holds for all x, then there exists an x for which P does not hold.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the not_exists theorem provided.\n\n2. Analyze available resources:\n   - We have access to the Main library.\n   - Two relevant theorems are provided: forall_iff and not_exists.\n   - The not_exists theorem seems particularly useful for this proof.\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with the assumption: ¬(∀x. P x)\n   b. Our goal is to prove: ∃x. ¬P x\n   c. We can use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume the negation of our goal: ¬(∃x. ¬P x)\n      - Use the not_exists theorem to transform this into: ∀x. ¬¬P x\n      - Simplify double negation: ∀x. P x\n      - This contradicts our initial assumption\n      - Therefore, our original goal must be true\n\n4. Implement the proof:\n   - Begin with the 'proof' command\n   - Use 'show ?thesis' to state our goal\n   - Employ proof by contradiction using 'proof (rule ccontr)'\n   - Apply the steps outlined in the strategy\n   - Use 'qed' to conclude the proof\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without errors\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the not_forall theorem, utilizing the provided theorems and basic logical principles.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem not_forall, we should follow the outlined proof strategy using proof by contradiction. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Start the proof using the 'proof' command. This will initiate the proof environment in Isabelle.\n\n2. State the goal using 'show ?thesis'. This establishes what we need to prove.\n\n3. Employ proof by contradiction using 'proof (rule ccontr)'. This allows us to assume the negation of our goal and derive a contradiction.\n\n4. Assume the negation of our goal: ¬(∃x. ¬P x). We can state this using 'assume'.\n\n5. Use the not_exists theorem to transform ¬(∃x. ¬P x) into ∀x. ¬¬P x. We can do this using the 'have' command and applying the not_exists theorem.\n\n6. Simplify the double negation ¬¬P x to P x. This can be done using simp or blast.\n\n7. Now we have ∀x. P x, which contradicts our initial assumption ¬(∀x. P x). We can show this contradiction using 'show False'.\n\n8. Conclude the proof with 'qed'.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to construct a valid proof for the not_forall theorem. The acting agent should start by implementing the first few steps of this reasoning, beginning with the 'proof' command and setting up the contradiction proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof incorrectly uses 'this' which is undefined in the current context, leading to an error.\nImprovement: Remove the reference to 'this' and directly use the assumption \"\\<not> (\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x)\" in the application of the not_exists theorem.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt is on the right track, but there's a small error in the implementation that's causing the proof to fail. The use of 'this' is incorrect because it's not defined in this context. \n\nTo improve, we should modify the line:\n\n```isabelle\nhave \"\\<forall>x. \\<not> \\<not> P x\" using not_exists[of \"\\<not> P\"] this by simp\n```\n\nto directly use the assumption we made earlier:\n\n```isabelle\nhave \"\\<forall>x. \\<not> \\<not> P x\" using not_exists[of \"\\<not> P\"] `\\<not> (\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x)` by simp\n```\n\nThis change will correctly apply the not_exists theorem to our assumption, allowing the proof to proceed. The rest of the proof structure looks correct and should lead to a successful proof of the not_forall theorem.\n\nFor future steps, it's important to ensure that all references in the proof are to defined terms or previously established facts. Always double-check that assumptions and theorems are being correctly applied and referenced.",
