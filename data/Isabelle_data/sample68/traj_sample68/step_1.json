    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem not_forall:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that if it's not true that P holds for all x, then there exists an x for which P does not hold.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the not_exists theorem provided.\n\n2. Analyze available resources:\n   - We have access to the Main library.\n   - Two relevant theorems are provided: forall_iff and not_exists.\n   - The not_exists theorem seems particularly useful for this proof.\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with the assumption: ¬(∀x. P x)\n   b. Our goal is to prove: ∃x. ¬P x\n   c. We can use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume the negation of our goal: ¬(∃x. ¬P x)\n      - Use the not_exists theorem to transform this into: ∀x. ¬¬P x\n      - Simplify double negation: ∀x. P x\n      - This contradicts our initial assumption\n      - Therefore, our original goal must be true\n\n4. Implement the proof:\n   - Begin with the 'proof' command\n   - Use 'show ?thesis' to state our goal\n   - Employ proof by contradiction using 'proof (rule ccontr)'\n   - Apply the steps outlined in the strategy\n   - Use 'qed' to conclude the proof\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without errors\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the not_forall theorem, utilizing the provided theorems and basic logical principles.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure is correct, but there's an error in how we're applying the not_exists theorem. We need to modify the line that's causing the error by directly referencing our assumption instead of using 'this'. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We've correctly started with a proof by contradiction (rule ccontr).\n2. We've assumed the negation of our goal: \"\\<not> (\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x)\".\n3. Now, we need to apply the not_exists theorem to this assumption.\n4. The not_exists theorem states: assumes \"\\<not> (\\<exists>x. P x)\" shows \"\\<forall>x. \\<not> P x\".\n5. In our case, we want to apply this with (\\<not> P) in place of P.\n6. So, we should use not_exists[of \"\\<not> P\"] and apply it to our assumption.\n7. This will give us \"\\<forall>x. \\<not> \\<not> P x\", which we can then simplify.\n\nThe acting agent should modify the line:\nhave \"\\<forall>x. \\<not> \\<not> P x\" using not_exists[of \"\\<not> P\"] this by simp\n\nto:\nhave \"\\<forall>x. \\<not> \\<not> P x\" using not_exists[of \"\\<not> P\"] `\\<not> (\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x)` by simp\n\nThis change will correctly apply the not_exists theorem to our assumption, allowing the proof to proceed. The rest of the proof can remain the same, as it logically follows from this step.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error is unrelated to the proof itself, but rather indicates an issue with the Isabelle environment or file system.\n\nImprovement: We need to ensure the Isabelle environment is properly set up and has the necessary write permissions before attempting to prove the theorem again.\n```\n\nThe current error message suggests that there is an issue with the Isabelle environment or the database it's trying to access, rather than a problem with our proof structure or logic. The error indicates that the database file has been moved since it was opened and that there's an attempt to write to a read-only database.\n\nThis is likely an issue with file permissions or the configuration of the Isabelle environment. It's not something that can be resolved by changing the proof itself. \n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. We need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and has the necessary permissions to write to its database.\n2. Check if there have been any recent changes to the file system or Isabelle configuration that might have caused this issue.\n3. If possible, try running Isabelle with elevated permissions or in a different directory where it has full read/write access.\n4. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to reinstall or reconfigure the Isabelle environment.\n\nOnce the environment issue is resolved, we can attempt to run the proof again. The current proof structure appears to be correct and should work once the external issues are addressed.",
