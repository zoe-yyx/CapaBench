    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is and_or_distr_l\n   - It states that P ∧ (Q ∨ R) ↔ (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - This is a logical equivalence, so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the Proof Structure:\n   - Use the iff (↔) introduction rule to split the proof into two parts\n   - Part 1: Prove P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - Part 2: Prove (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n3. Outline Proof Steps for Part 1:\n   a. Assume P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   b. Extract P and (Q ∨ R) from the assumption\n   c. Use case analysis on (Q ∨ R)\n   d. For Q case: Prove (P ∧ Q) which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   e. For R case: Prove (P ∧ R) which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n\n4. Outline Proof Steps for Part 2:\n   a. Assume (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   b. Use case analysis on the assumption\n   c. For P ∧ Q case: Prove P and Q, then show P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   d. For P ∧ R case: Prove P and R, then show P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n5. Tactics to Consider:\n   - Use 'apply (rule iffI)' to start with iff introduction\n   - Use 'apply (erule conjE)' to eliminate conjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (erule disjE)' for case analysis on disjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (rule disjI1)' or 'apply (rule disjI2)' to introduce disjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (rule conjI)' to introduce conjunctions\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all goals are solved\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a syntax error in the lemma statement due to the use of non-standard logical symbols. To proceed with the proof, we need to correct this error first. Here's what we should do:\n\n1. Revise the lemma statement:\n   - Replace ∧ with \\<and>\n   - Replace ∨ with \\<or>\n   - Replace ⟷ with \\<longleftrightarrow>\n\n2. After correcting the syntax, we can proceed with the proof structure as outlined in the planning stage:\n   - Use the iff introduction rule to split the proof into two parts\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. For the first direction (P \\<and> (Q \\<or> R) ⟹ (P \\<and> Q) \\<or> (P \\<and> R)):\n   - Start by assuming the left-hand side\n   - Use conjunction elimination to separate P and (Q \\<or> R)\n   - Perform case analysis on (Q \\<or> R)\n   - For each case, construct the appropriate conjunction and introduce the disjunction\n\n4. For the second direction ((P \\<and> Q) \\<or> (P \\<and> R) ⟹ P \\<and> (Q \\<or> R)):\n   - Start by assuming the left-hand side\n   - Use disjunction elimination to handle both cases\n   - For each case, extract P and the respective Q or R\n   - Construct the required conjunction and disjunction\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to complete the proof successfully once the syntax error is corrected.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is syntactically correct, but there's an issue with Isabelle's execution environment preventing the proof from being processed.\n\nImprovement: We need to investigate and resolve the database-related error in the Isabelle environment before proceeding with the proof, as the current proof structure is correct and should work once the environment issue is fixed.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that our proof structure and approach are correct, but we're facing an external issue with Isabelle's execution environment. The error message suggests that there's a problem with the database file used by Isabelle, which has been moved or is read-only.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. Environment Check: We need to ensure that Isabelle is properly installed and configured on the system. This includes checking file permissions and database locations.\n\n2. Restart Isabelle: Sometimes, restarting the Isabelle environment can resolve temporary issues with file access or database connections.\n\n3. Reinstall or Update: If the problem persists, consider reinstalling or updating Isabelle to ensure all components are correctly set up.\n\n4. Alternative Proof Methods: While our current proof structure is correct, we could explore alternative proof methods that might be less affected by the current environment issues. For instance, we could try using 'auto' or other automated tactics to see if they can complete the proof without encountering the same error.\n\n5. Modular Approach: We could break down the proof into smaller lemmas, proving each direction of the iff separately. This might help isolate where the environment issue is affecting the proof process.\n\n6. Manual Steps: If automated methods continue to fail due to environment issues, we could try to prove the theorem step-by-step using more basic tactics, which might be less affected by the database error.\n\nOnce the environment issue is resolved, our current proof structure should work correctly. The focus should be on fixing the Isabelle environment rather than changing the proof itself.",
