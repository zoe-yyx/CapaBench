    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is and_or_distr_l\n   - It states that P ∧ (Q ∨ R) ↔ (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - This is a logical equivalence, so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the Proof Structure:\n   - Use the iff (↔) introduction rule to split the proof into two parts\n   - Part 1: Prove P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - Part 2: Prove (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n3. Outline Proof Steps for Part 1:\n   a. Assume P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   b. Extract P and (Q ∨ R) from the assumption\n   c. Use case analysis on (Q ∨ R)\n   d. For Q case: Prove (P ∧ Q) which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   e. For R case: Prove (P ∧ R) which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n\n4. Outline Proof Steps for Part 2:\n   a. Assume (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   b. Use case analysis on the assumption\n   c. For P ∧ Q case: Prove P and Q, then show P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   d. For P ∧ R case: Prove P and R, then show P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n5. Tactics to Consider:\n   - Use 'apply (rule iffI)' to start with iff introduction\n   - Use 'apply (erule conjE)' to eliminate conjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (erule disjE)' for case analysis on disjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (rule disjI1)' or 'apply (rule disjI2)' to introduce disjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (rule conjI)' to introduce conjunctions\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all goals are solved\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, our reasoning should focus on addressing the environment issue while maintaining our correct proof structure. Here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent:\n\n1. Environment Troubleshooting:\n   - The error message suggests a problem with Isabelle's database file. The acting agent should first attempt to restart the Isabelle environment to see if this resolves the issue.\n   - If restarting doesn't work, the agent should check file permissions and ensure that Isabelle has write access to its database file.\n\n2. Proof Preservation:\n   - Our current proof structure is correct and follows the planned approach. We should maintain this structure for when the environment issue is resolved.\n\n3. Alternative Proof Strategies:\n   - If the environment issue persists, we can try simplifying our proof approach:\n     a. Use the 'auto' tactic to attempt an automated proof.\n     b. If 'auto' fails, break down the proof into smaller steps using basic tactics like 'apply (rule iffI)', 'apply (rule conjI)', 'apply (rule disjI1)', etc.\n\n4. Modular Approach:\n   - Consider splitting the proof into two separate lemmas, one for each direction of the iff. This might help isolate where the environment issue is affecting the proof process.\n\n5. Manual Verification:\n   - If automated methods continue to fail, we can guide the acting agent to verify each step manually, using basic inference rules and tactics.\n\n6. Documentation:\n   - Regardless of the outcome, document the environment issue and the steps taken to address it. This will be valuable for future problem-solving and environment setup.\n\nThe acting agent should prioritize resolving the environment issue while being prepared to adapt the proof strategy if necessary. The goal is to maintain the correct logical structure of our proof while working around any technical limitations.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof failed at the step where we attempt to prove \"Q\" from the assumptions \"P\" and \"R\", which is not possible without additional information.\n\nImprovement: We need to revise our proof structure, particularly in the left-to-right direction, to correctly handle the disjunction in the antecedent and avoid introducing unprovable subgoals.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt has a logical error in its structure, specifically in the left-to-right direction of the bi-implication. Let's break down the issues and suggest improvements:\n\n1. Proof Structure: The overall approach of using `rule iffI` to split the bi-implication into two directions is correct. However, the left-to-right direction needs adjustment.\n\n2. Left-to-Right Direction:\n   - The current approach attempts to prove `(P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)` by first assuming `P ∧ (Q ∨ R)`.\n   - The error occurs because we're trying to prove `Q` from `P` and `R`, which is not valid.\n\n3. Correct Approach:\n   - We should handle the disjunction `Q ∨ R` by case analysis using `erule disjE`.\n   - For each case (`Q` and `R`), we can then construct the appropriate disjunct of `(P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)`.\n\n4. Right-to-Left Direction:\n   - The current approach for this direction seems correct and should be maintained.\n\n5. Actionable Steps:\n   - Revise the left-to-right direction of the proof.\n   - Use `erule disjE` to handle `Q ∨ R`.\n   - For each case, use `rule disjI1` or `rule disjI2` as appropriate, followed by `rule conjI`.\n\n6. Automation:\n   - Consider using `auto` or `simp` tactics after splitting the bi-implication to see if Isabelle can automatically complete parts of the proof.\n\n7. Step-by-Step Verification:\n   - If automated tactics don't fully solve the problem, proceed with a careful step-by-step proof, ensuring each step is logically sound.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to construct a valid proof for the theorem without introducing unprovable subgoals. The acting agent should focus on revising the proof structure according to these suggestions.",
