    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is and_or_distr_l\n   - It states that P ∧ (Q ∨ R) ↔ (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - This is a logical equivalence, so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the Proof Structure:\n   - Use the iff (↔) introduction rule to split the proof into two parts\n   - Part 1: Prove P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - Part 2: Prove (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n3. Outline Proof Steps for Part 1:\n   a. Assume P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   b. Extract P and (Q ∨ R) from the assumption\n   c. Use case analysis on (Q ∨ R)\n   d. For Q case: Prove (P ∧ Q) which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   e. For R case: Prove (P ∧ R) which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n\n4. Outline Proof Steps for Part 2:\n   a. Assume (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   b. Use case analysis on the assumption\n   c. For P ∧ Q case: Prove P and Q, then show P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   d. For P ∧ R case: Prove P and R, then show P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n5. Tactics to Consider:\n   - Use 'apply (rule iffI)' to start with iff introduction\n   - Use 'apply (erule conjE)' to eliminate conjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (erule disjE)' for case analysis on disjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (rule disjI1)' or 'apply (rule disjI2)' to introduce disjunctions\n   - Use 'apply (rule conjI)' to introduce conjunctions\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all goals are solved\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned proof structure. The first step in our plan is to use the iff introduction rule to split the proof into two parts.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to prove a bi-directional implication (↔), so using the iff introduction rule is the appropriate starting point.\n2. This will set up our proof structure by creating two subgoals: \n   - P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n3. By starting with this step, we'll be able to tackle each direction of the proof separately, which aligns with our planned approach.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin the proof by applying the iff introduction rule. This can be done using the tactic 'apply (rule iffI)'.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof failed due to a syntax error in the lemma statement, specifically with the use of non-standard symbols for logical operators.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard symbols (∧, ∨, ⟷) with their Isabelle-specific equivalents (\\<and>, \\<or>, \\<longleftrightarrow>) in the lemma statement to ensure proper parsing and execution of the proof.\n```\n\nThe current result is unsatisfactory because Isabelle was unable to parse the lemma statement due to the use of non-standard logical symbols. This indicates that we need to be more careful about using Isabelle-specific syntax in our proofs.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Double-check all logical symbols in our statements and proofs to ensure they are in the correct Isabelle format.\n2. Use \\<and> for conjunction, \\<or> for disjunction, and \\<longleftrightarrow> for bi-implication in Isabelle proofs.\n3. Be more attentive to Isabelle's specific syntax requirements in future steps.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we can avoid syntax errors and focus on the actual proof logic. The acting agent should revise the lemma statement using the correct Isabelle symbols before proceeding with the proof steps. This will align our actions more closely with the goal of successfully proving the theorem in Isabelle's formal language.",
