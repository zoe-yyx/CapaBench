    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem structure:\n   - We have two assumptions and a conclusion to prove\n   - The first assumption is a universal quantification\n   - The second assumption is a specific instance\n   - The conclusion is a negation\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with a proof by contradiction\n   b. Assume the negation of the conclusion (i.e., assume P a0)\n   c. Use the given assumptions to derive a contradiction\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Begin the proof\n   b. Assume P a0 (the negation of the conclusion)\n   c. Apply the first assumption with a0 as the universal variable\n   d. Use the second assumption (Q a0) and the assumed P a0\n   e. Derive False from the implication in the first assumption\n   f. Conclude that the assumption P a0 leads to a contradiction\n   g. Therefore, prove ¬P a0\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'proof (rule ccontr)' for proof by contradiction\n   - Use 'assume' for introducing the assumption\n   - Use 'have' for intermediate steps\n   - Use 'show' for the final conclusion\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Correctly instantiating the universal quantifier in the first assumption\n   - Properly combining the assumptions to reach the contradiction\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all assumptions are used in the proof\n   - Check that the proof follows logical steps without gaps\n   - Confirm that the conclusion ¬P a0 is properly derived\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof, we need to derive a contradiction using the given assumptions and our assumed negation of the goal. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have assumed \"¬¬P a0\" and derived \"P a0\" from it.\n2. We need to use the first assumption \"∀a. P a → Q a → False\" by instantiating it with a0.\n3. After instantiation, we'll have \"P a0 → Q a0 → False\".\n4. We already have \"P a0\" from our assumption and \"Q a0\" from the second given assumption.\n5. By applying these to the instantiated first assumption, we should be able to derive False.\n6. This False will complete our proof by contradiction.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on:\na) Instantiating the first assumption with a0\nb) Using the instantiated assumption along with P a0 and Q a0 to derive False\nc) Ensuring each step is properly justified using appropriate Isabelle tactics (like 'have', 'from', 'with', etc.)\nd) Concluding the proof by showing that False has been derived under the assumption ¬¬P a0\n\nThis approach should lead to a complete and rigorous proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof appears to be correct, but there's an issue with the Isabelle environment or database causing a SQLITE constraint failure.\n\nImprovement: We need to investigate and resolve the SQLITE constraint issue, possibly by clearing the Isabelle session cache or ensuring unique session names, before proceeding with the proof verification.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and reasoning seem to be correct and follow the planned approach. The proof uses contradiction (rule ccontr) and correctly applies the given assumptions to derive False, which is the desired outcome for this proof strategy.\n\nHowever, the error message indicates a problem with the Isabelle environment rather than with the proof itself. The SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY error suggests that there might be an issue with the Isabelle session database, possibly due to a conflict in session names or a corruption in the session cache.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. The planning agent should consider adding steps to troubleshoot the Isabelle environment.\n2. The reasoning agent should focus on verifying that the proof structure is correct (which it appears to be) and consider if any alternative proof strategies could be used as a workaround.\n3. The acting agent should attempt to resolve the SQLITE issue by:\n   a) Clearing the Isabelle session cache\n   b) Ensuring that the theory name is unique\n   c) Restarting the Isabelle environment\n   d) Checking for any conflicting theory names in the current project\n\nOnce the environment issue is resolved, we should be able to verify that the current proof is correct and complete. If the issue persists, we may need to consider alternative ways to structure the proof or even use a different theorem prover temporarily to verify the logical correctness of our approach.",
