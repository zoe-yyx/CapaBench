    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem structure:\n   - We have two assumptions and a conclusion to prove\n   - The first assumption is a universal quantification\n   - The second assumption is a specific instance\n   - The conclusion is a negation\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with a proof by contradiction\n   b. Assume the negation of the conclusion (i.e., assume P a0)\n   c. Use the given assumptions to derive a contradiction\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Begin the proof\n   b. Assume P a0 (the negation of the conclusion)\n   c. Apply the first assumption with a0 as the universal variable\n   d. Use the second assumption (Q a0) and the assumed P a0\n   e. Derive False from the implication in the first assumption\n   f. Conclude that the assumption P a0 leads to a contradiction\n   g. Therefore, prove ¬P a0\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'proof (rule ccontr)' for proof by contradiction\n   - Use 'assume' for introducing the assumption\n   - Use 'have' for intermediate steps\n   - Use 'show' for the final conclusion\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Correctly instantiating the universal quantifier in the first assumption\n   - Properly combining the assumptions to reach the contradiction\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all assumptions are used in the proof\n   - Check that the proof follows logical steps without gaps\n   - Confirm that the conclusion ¬P a0 is properly derived\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof successfully, we need to make the derivation of False more explicit. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Keep the initial part of the proof up to deriving \"P a0\" from \"¬¬P a0\".\n\n2. Apply the first assumption to a0 more explicitly:\n   - Use the 'have' command to state \"P a0 ⟶ Q a0 ⟶ False\"\n   - Use the 'using' keyword to reference assms(1)\n   - Apply the allE (all elimination) rule to instantiate the universal quantifier\n\n3. Use modus ponens twice to derive False:\n   - First, derive \"Q a0 ⟶ False\" using `P a0` and the result from step 2\n   - Then, derive False using the result from the previous step and assms(2)\n\n4. Explicitly show that we've reached a contradiction:\n   - Use 'then show False .' to conclude the proof\n\nThese steps will make the logical flow of the proof more clear and should resolve the failure to finish the proof. The acting agent should implement these changes in the next round, focusing on explicitly deriving False from the given assumptions and intermediate steps.\n",
