    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem smul_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving that smul 2 3 = 11\n   - We need to use the definition of smul provided in the theory\n\n2. Break down the steps:\n   a) Expand the definition of smul for the given inputs (2 and 3)\n   b) Simplify the resulting expression\n   c) Show that the simplified expression equals 11\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   1) Start the proof\n   2) Unfold the definition of smul\n   3) Substitute the values x=2 and y=3 into the expanded definition\n   4) Perform arithmetic calculations\n   5) Show that the result equals 11\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold: to expand the definition of smul\n   - simp: for simplification and arithmetic calculations\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward as it mainly involves arithmetic\n   - No additional lemmas or theorems seem necessary for this simple calculation\n\n6. Expected challenges:\n   - None anticipated; this appears to be a straightforward application of the definition and basic arithmetic\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all steps are logically sound and that the final result indeed shows smul 2 3 = 11\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The primary issue is a syntax error in the definition of the 'smul' function. The Unicode arrows (⇒) are causing a lexical error.\n\n2. We need to modify the function definition to use ASCII arrows (=>) instead of Unicode arrows (⇒).\n\n3. Once this syntactic issue is resolved, the original proof strategy should still be valid.\n\n4. The acting agent should:\n   a) Modify the 'smul' function definition to use ASCII arrows.\n   b) Keep the rest of the definition and the proof attempt unchanged.\n\n5. After making this change, the proof using 'simp add: smul_def' should proceed without errors and successfully prove the lemma.\n\n6. This change doesn't affect the mathematical content or the proof strategy; it's purely a syntactic adjustment for Isabelle's parser.\n\n7. If successful, this should complete the proof of 'smul_ex2' as originally planned, demonstrating that smul 2 3 = 11 through definition expansion and simplification.\n",
