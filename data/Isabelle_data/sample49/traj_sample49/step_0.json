Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving that smul 2 3 = 11\n   - We need to use the definition of smul provided in the theory\n\n2.

    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the lemma smul_ex2: \"smul 2 3 = 11\", we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. The definition of smul is crucial for this proof. We need to start by unfolding this definition to work with its explicit form.\n\n2. After unfolding the definition, we'll have an equation involving the specific values 2 and 3, which we can then simplify through arithmetic calculations.\n\n3. The proof should be straightforward and can likely be completed in a single step using a combination of definition unfolding and simplification.\n\n4. Given that we're dealing with simple integer arithmetic, we can leverage Isabelle's built-in simplification capabilities to handle the calculations automatically.\n\n5. The proof strategy should involve using the 'simp' tactic, which will both unfold the definition of smul and perform the necessary arithmetic calculations in one go.\n\n6. We expect the 'simp' tactic to be sufficient to prove this lemma without any additional manual steps or intermediate goals.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should be guided to apply the 'simp' tactic, which should unfold the definition of smul, substitute the values 2 and 3, perform the arithmetic, and prove the equality in a single step.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type signature of the 'smul' function definition, specifically with the use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒).\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbols (⇒) with ASCII representation (=>) in the type signature of the 'smul' function to ensure compatibility and correct parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the syntax used for defining the 'smul' function. The use of Unicode symbols, while visually appealing, has caused a parsing error in Isabelle. This suggests that the environment or configuration may not be set up to handle Unicode input properly.\n\nTo improve future actions:\n\n1. The planning and reasoning agents should be more cautious about using special characters or Unicode symbols, opting for standard ASCII representations when defining functions and types.\n\n2. The acting agent should modify the function definition to use the ASCII arrow (=>) instead of the Unicode arrow (⇒).\n\n3. After making this change, the proof strategy using 'simp add: smul_def' should still be valid and likely to succeed.\n\n4. In future proofs, it may be beneficial to start with simpler, ASCII-based definitions and gradually introduce more advanced notation only after ensuring basic functionality works.\n\n5. The team should consider adding a step in the planning phase to verify syntax compatibility with Isabelle's parser, especially when working with definitions that involve special characters or symbols.\n\nBy addressing this syntax issue, the team should be able to proceed with the proof as originally planned, using the simplification tactic to unfold the definition and complete the arithmetic calculation.",
