    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for shift_left1_func_plus:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1\n   - Recognize that func_plus combines two functions by addition\n   - Understand that shift_left1 shifts the input of a function by 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the goal: shift_left1 (func_plus f g) = func_plus (shift_left1 f) (shift_left1 g)\n   - Use the 'apply (rule ext)' tactic to work with arbitrary x\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Unfold the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus on both sides of the equation\n   - This will involve multiple steps of unfolding\n\n4. Simplify the expressions:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Look for common terms or patterns\n\n5. Prove equality:\n   - Show that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side for an arbitrary x\n   - This may involve basic arithmetic and function application\n\n6. Handle any remaining goals:\n   - Address any subgoals that may have been generated during the proof process\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use 'done' or 'by simp' if the proof is complete after simplification\n\n8. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure that all definitions were correctly applied\n   - Verify that the proof follows logically from the definitions and properties of functions\n\nThis plan should guide the player through a systematic approach to proving the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions and simplifying expressions to show the equality.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the lemma shift_left1_func_plus, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by applying the extensionality principle. This will allow us to work with an arbitrary input x, which is crucial for proving equality of functions.\n\n2. After applying extensionality, we need to unfold the definitions of both shift_left1 and func_plus. This will expose the underlying operations and allow us to manipulate the expressions.\n\n3. Once the definitions are unfolded, we should have expressions on both sides of the equation that we can simplify and compare.\n\n4. The left-hand side of the equation will involve applying func_plus first and then shift_left1, while the right-hand side will involve applying shift_left1 to each function separately and then combining them with func_plus.\n\n5. After unfolding and simplification, we expect to see that both sides of the equation reduce to equivalent expressions, likely involving f(x+1) and g(x+1) terms.\n\n6. At this point, basic simplification or rewriting should be sufficient to show that the two sides are equal.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying the extensionality rule and then proceed to unfold the relevant definitions. This will set up the proof for further simplification and eventual completion.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type definition of func_plus, specifically with the use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒).\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of the Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) in the type definitions to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThe primary issue here is that the Isabelle parser encountered difficulty with the Unicode arrow symbols used in the type definitions. This is likely due to encoding issues or incompatibility with the specific Isabelle environment being used.\n\nTo address this, we should modify the type definitions to use the ASCII arrow symbol (=>) instead of the Unicode version (⇒). This change should be applied consistently throughout the theory file, including in the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Update the type signatures in all definitions, replacing ⇒ with =>.\n2. Ensure that this change is made consistently throughout the entire theory file.\n3. Re-run the proof attempt with these modifications.\n\nThis adjustment should resolve the lexical error and allow the parser to successfully process the type definitions, enabling the proof to proceed. The logical structure of the proof itself appears sound, so once this syntactical issue is resolved, the proof should be able to continue as planned.",
