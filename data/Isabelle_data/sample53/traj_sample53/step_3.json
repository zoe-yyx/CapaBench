    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for shift_left1_func_plus:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1\n   - Recognize that func_plus combines two functions by addition\n   - Understand that shift_left1 shifts the input of a function by 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the goal: shift_left1 (func_plus f g) = func_plus (shift_left1 f) (shift_left1 g)\n   - Use the 'apply (rule ext)' tactic to work with arbitrary x\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Unfold the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus on both sides of the equation\n   - This will involve multiple steps of unfolding\n\n4. Simplify the expressions:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Look for common terms or patterns\n\n5. Prove equality:\n   - Show that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side for an arbitrary x\n   - This may involve basic arithmetic and function application\n\n6. Handle any remaining goals:\n   - Address any subgoals that may have been generated during the proof process\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use 'done' or 'by simp' if the proof is complete after simplification\n\n8. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure that all definitions were correctly applied\n   - Verify that the proof follows logically from the definitions and properties of functions\n\nThis plan should guide the player through a systematic approach to proving the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions and simplifying expressions to show the equality.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is due to a lexical issue with the unicode arrow symbol (⇒) in the type definitions. To resolve this:\n\n1. Replace all instances of the unicode arrow (⇒) with its ASCII equivalent (=>) in the type definitions for both func_plus and shift_left1.\n\n2. After making these changes, attempt to run the proof again. The modified type definitions should allow Isabelle to parse the theory file correctly.\n\n3. If the lexical error is resolved but new issues arise, carefully review any new error messages and adjust the proof accordingly.\n\n4. Once the proof runs without lexical errors, review the entire proof to ensure that:\n   a) No other unicode symbols are causing issues\n   b) The logical structure of the proof remains intact after the symbol replacement\n\n5. If the proof runs successfully after these changes, proceed with the existing proof structure, which is logically sound:\n   - Use 'rule ext' to work with an arbitrary x\n   - Unfold the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus\n   - Use algebra to show the equality of both sides\n\nRemember, the core logic of the proof remains valid; we're primarily addressing a technical issue with symbol encoding.\n",
