    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for shift_left1_func_plus:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1\n   - Recognize that func_plus combines two functions by addition\n   - Understand that shift_left1 shifts the input of a function by 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the goal: shift_left1 (func_plus f g) = func_plus (shift_left1 f) (shift_left1 g)\n   - Use the 'apply (rule ext)' tactic to work with arbitrary x\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Unfold the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus on both sides of the equation\n   - This will involve multiple steps of unfolding\n\n4. Simplify the expressions:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Look for common terms or patterns\n\n5. Prove equality:\n   - Show that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side for an arbitrary x\n   - This may involve basic arithmetic and function application\n\n6. Handle any remaining goals:\n   - Address any subgoals that may have been generated during the proof process\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use 'done' or 'by simp' if the proof is complete after simplification\n\n8. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure that all definitions were correctly applied\n   - Verify that the proof follows logically from the definitions and properties of functions\n\nThis plan should guide the player through a systematic approach to proving the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions and simplifying expressions to show the equality.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue preventing progress is a lexical error in the type definitions due to the use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒). To resolve this and allow the proof to proceed, we need to modify the type definitions to use ASCII-compatible syntax. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Type Definition Modification:\n   - Replace all instances of ⇒ with => in the type signatures.\n   - This change needs to be applied to both func_plus and shift_left1 definitions.\n\n2. Consistency Check:\n   - Ensure that this replacement is done consistently throughout the entire theory file.\n   - This includes the lemma statement if it uses function types.\n\n3. Proof Structure Preservation:\n   - The logical structure of the proof appears correct, so we should maintain it.\n   - After fixing the syntax, the existing proof steps should remain valid.\n\n4. Re-attempt Proof:\n   - Once the syntax is corrected, we should be able to proceed with the proof as originally planned.\n   - The steps involving unfolding definitions and simplification should work as intended.\n\n5. Verification:\n   - After making these changes, carefully review the modified theory to ensure no unintended alterations were made.\n   - Pay special attention to the type signatures and any use of function types in the proof.\n\nBy addressing the syntactical issue with the arrow symbols, we should be able to overcome the lexical error and proceed with the proof. The existing proof structure is logically sound and should work once the parser can correctly interpret the type definitions.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, I can provide the following reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The error message indicates a database constraint issue, which is unrelated to the Isabelle proof itself and likely stems from an environment or setup problem.\nImprovement: We need to focus on resolving the database constraint issue, possibly by checking the Isabelle environment setup or consulting system administrators, before proceeding with the proof.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current issue is not related to the proof logic or syntax, but rather to the underlying system running Isabelle. The SQLite error suggests a problem with the database used by Isabelle to store session information.\n\nTo address this:\n\n1. Environment Check: Verify that Isabelle is correctly installed and configured on the system.\n\n2. Database Integrity: The error suggests a potential corruption or conflict in the Isabelle session database. Consider clearing cached session data or rebuilding the database.\n\n3. Permissions: Ensure that the user running Isabelle has the necessary permissions to read and write to the session database.\n\n4. Version Compatibility: Check if there are any known issues with the current version of Isabelle regarding session management.\n\n5. System Resources: Verify that there are sufficient system resources (disk space, memory) available for Isabelle to operate correctly.\n\n6. Isolate the Issue: Try running a simple Isabelle theory to see if the problem persists, which would help determine if it's specific to this proof or a broader system issue.\n\n7. Seek Technical Support: If the issue persists, it may be necessary to consult Isabelle documentation or seek help from the Isabelle community or system administrators.\n\nOnce this technical issue is resolved, we can return to the proof itself, which appears to be correctly structured and should proceed without issues once the environment is functioning properly.",
