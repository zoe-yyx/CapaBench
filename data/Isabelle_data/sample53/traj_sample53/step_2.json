    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for shift_left1_func_plus:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1\n   - Recognize that func_plus combines two functions by addition\n   - Understand that shift_left1 shifts the input of a function by 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the goal: shift_left1 (func_plus f g) = func_plus (shift_left1 f) (shift_left1 g)\n   - Use the 'apply (rule ext)' tactic to work with arbitrary x\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Unfold the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus on both sides of the equation\n   - This will involve multiple steps of unfolding\n\n4. Simplify the expressions:\n   - After unfolding, simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Look for common terms or patterns\n\n5. Prove equality:\n   - Show that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side for an arbitrary x\n   - This may involve basic arithmetic and function application\n\n6. Handle any remaining goals:\n   - Address any subgoals that may have been generated during the proof process\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use 'done' or 'by simp' if the proof is complete after simplification\n\n8. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure that all definitions were correctly applied\n   - Verify that the proof follows logically from the definitions and properties of functions\n\nThis plan should guide the player through a systematic approach to proving the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions and simplifying expressions to show the equality.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is a database-related issue, not a problem with the Isabelle proof itself. The proof we've constructed so far is logically sound and follows the planned strategy correctly. However, we're unable to proceed due to a technical constraint in the Isabelle environment.\n\nGiven this situation, our reasoning should focus on resolving the technical issue rather than modifying the proof:\n\n1. Environment Verification: The acting agent should first verify the Isabelle installation and configuration. This includes checking for any recent changes to the system that might have affected the Isabelle setup.\n\n2. Database Maintenance: The SQLite error suggests an issue with the Isabelle session database. The acting agent should attempt to clear the Isabelle cache and rebuild the session database. This can often be done by removing temporary Isabelle files and restarting the IDE.\n\n3. Permission Check: Ensure that the user running Isabelle has the necessary permissions to access and modify the session database.\n\n4. Isabelle Version: Confirm that the installed version of Isabelle is up-to-date and compatible with the current system setup.\n\n5. Isolated Test: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, try creating a new, minimal Isabelle theory file to test if the problem is specific to our current proof or a more general issue with the Isabelle environment.\n\nOnce the technical issue is resolved, we can return to the proof itself. The current proof structure is correct and should be maintained. After resolving the database issue, the acting agent should attempt to run the proof again without making any changes to the proof itself.\n\nIf the proof runs successfully after resolving the technical issue, we can consider the theorem proven and move on to any additional tasks or theorems that need to be addressed.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is logically sound, but there's a lexical error in the type definition of func_plus, likely due to encoding issues with the arrow symbol (⇒).\n\nImprovement: Replace the unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with its ASCII equivalent (=>) in the type definitions to avoid potential encoding-related lexical errors.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that while our proof structure is correct, we're encountering a lexical error that's preventing Isabelle from parsing the type definitions correctly. The issue seems to be with the unicode arrow symbol (⇒) used in the type definitions.\n\nTo improve our next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should modify the type definitions in the theory file, replacing all instances of the unicode arrow (⇒) with its ASCII equivalent (=>). This should be done for both func_plus and shift_left1 definitions.\n\n2. After making these changes, the acting agent should attempt to run the proof again. The modified type definitions should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to parse the theory file correctly.\n\n3. If the lexical error is resolved but new issues arise, the reasoning agent should carefully review the error messages and adjust the proof accordingly.\n\n4. The planning agent should consider adding a step to verify symbol compatibility in future proofs, especially when working with different Isabelle environments or sharing proofs across systems.\n\n5. Once the proof runs successfully, we should review the entire proof to ensure that no other unicode symbols are causing issues and that the logical structure remains intact after the symbol replacement.\n\nThis approach should address the immediate lexical error while maintaining the logical integrity of our proof. It also provides a strategy for avoiding similar issues in future proofs.",
