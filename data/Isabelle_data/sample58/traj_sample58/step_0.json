    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_assoc theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're working with a custom datatype 'mynat' and a custom addition function 'myadd'.\n   - We need to prove the associativity of 'myadd': myadd n (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd n m) p\n\n2. Induction strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on 'n' (the first argument of myadd).\n   - This is because the myadd function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n3. Base case:\n   - Prove the theorem for n = MyZero\n   - This should be straightforward using the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n4. Inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some n\n   - Prove it holds for MySuc n\n   - This will involve applying the definition of myadd for the MySuc case\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Use simp or auto tactics to simplify expressions where possible\n   - This can help in reducing complex expressions to more manageable forms\n\n6. Rewriting:\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal\n   - This is crucial for completing the inductive step\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Once both base case and inductive step are proved, the theorem is established by induction\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to unfold the definition of myadd multiple times\n   - May need to use the associativity property within the proof itself\n\n9. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without any remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of the custom addition function myadd. By following these steps, the player should be able to construct a valid proof in Isabelle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem description and the planning strategy, we can start guiding the acting agent through the proof process. Since we're at the beginning of the proof, our reasoning should focus on setting up the induction and tackling the base case. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Start by applying induction on the variable 'n'. This aligns with our plan to use structural induction on the first argument of myadd.\n\n2. After applying induction, we should see two subgoals: the base case (n = MyZero) and the inductive step (n = MySuc n').\n\n3. For the base case, we need to prove: \n   myadd MyZero (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd MyZero m) p\n\n4. To prove this, we should:\n   a) Apply the definition of myadd for the MyZero case.\n   b) Use simplification to reduce the expressions.\n\n5. The base case should be relatively straightforward and might be solved automatically by simplification tactics.\n\n6. For the inductive step, we'll need to prove:\n   myadd (MySuc n') (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd (MySuc n') m) p\n   \n   Assuming the inductive hypothesis:\n   myadd n' (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd n' m) p\n\n7. To tackle the inductive step, we'll need to:\n   a) Apply the definition of myadd for the MySuc case.\n   b) Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal.\n   c) Apply simplification and rewriting tactics as needed.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying induction on 'n' and then focus on solving the base case using simplification tactics. Once the base case is resolved, we can provide further guidance on tackling the inductive step.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function, specifically with the arrow symbols.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbols (⇒) with the correct Isabelle arrow symbols (\\<Rightarrow>) in the type declaration of 'myadd' to ensure proper parsing and continue with the proof structure.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the syntax of the function declaration, rather than in the proof strategy itself. The use of non-standard arrow symbols is causing Isabelle to fail in parsing the type declaration. \n\nFor future steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should correct the arrow symbols in the 'myadd' function declaration.\n2. Once this syntax error is fixed, the proof structure appears to be on the right track. The induction on 'n' has been correctly applied, and the base case (MyZero) has been solved using simplification.\n3. The next focus should be on completing the inductive step (MySuc case) without using 'sorry'.\n4. The reasoning and acting agents should work together to apply the definition of 'myadd' for the MySuc case, use the inductive hypothesis, and complete the proof using appropriate tactics.\n\nBy addressing this syntax issue and following through with the planned proof strategy, we should be able to make progress towards proving the add_assoc theorem rigorously.",
