    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_assoc theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're working with a custom datatype 'mynat' and a custom addition function 'myadd'.\n   - We need to prove the associativity of 'myadd': myadd n (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd n m) p\n\n2. Induction strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on 'n' (the first argument of myadd).\n   - This is because the myadd function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n3. Base case:\n   - Prove the theorem for n = MyZero\n   - This should be straightforward using the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n4. Inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some n\n   - Prove it holds for MySuc n\n   - This will involve applying the definition of myadd for the MySuc case\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Use simp or auto tactics to simplify expressions where possible\n   - This can help in reducing complex expressions to more manageable forms\n\n6. Rewriting:\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal\n   - This is crucial for completing the inductive step\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Once both base case and inductive step are proved, the theorem is established by induction\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to unfold the definition of myadd multiple times\n   - May need to use the associativity property within the proof itself\n\n9. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without any remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of the custom addition function myadd. By following these steps, the player should be able to construct a valid proof in Isabelle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof of the add_assoc theorem, we need to focus on the inductive step (MySuc case). Here's a step-by-step reasoning to guide the next actions:\n\n1. Start by expanding the definition of 'myadd' on both sides of the equation for the MySuc case. This will give us:\n\n   MySuc (myadd n (myadd m p)) = MySuc (myadd (myadd n m) p)\n\n2. The goal now is to prove that these two expressions are equal. We can do this by showing that their inner parts are equal:\n\n   myadd n (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd n m) p\n\n3. This inner equality is exactly what we have in our induction hypothesis. We can use the induction hypothesis directly to prove this equality.\n\n4. After applying the induction hypothesis, both sides should be identical, and the proof should be complete.\n\n5. If simplification is needed, we can use the 'simp' tactic, which should recognize the definition of 'myadd' and the induction hypothesis.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should:\na) Expand the definition of 'myadd' for the MySuc case.\nb) Apply the induction hypothesis.\nc) Use simplification tactics if necessary.\nd) Conclude the proof.\n\nThis approach should lead to a complete proof of the add_assoc theorem without relying on 'sorry'.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was successful, but there were technical issues with the Isabelle environment, specifically related to database access and constraints.\n\nImprovement: The proof strategy and implementation were correct, so we should focus on resolving the Isabelle environment issues, possibly by ensuring proper file permissions and database integrity before proceeding with further proofs.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the proof itself was correctly constructed and executed. The theorem add_assoc was proven successfully using induction, case analysis, and proper use of simplification tactics. The proof did not rely on 'sorry' and was completed rigorously.\n\nHowever, the errors observed are related to the Isabelle environment rather than the proof itself. These issues seem to be causing problems with exporting or saving the results, likely due to file permissions or database configuration problems.\n\nFor future actions:\n\n1. The proof strategy and implementation do not need modification as they were correct.\n\n2. Before attempting further proofs or modifications, it's crucial to address the Isabelle environment issues:\n   - Check and correct file permissions for the database and related files.\n   - Ensure the database is not in a read-only state or has been moved unexpectedly.\n   - Verify the integrity of the Isabelle session database.\n\n3. Once the environment issues are resolved, re-run the proof to ensure it can be properly saved and exported.\n\n4. For future proofs, maintain this level of rigorous proof construction, avoiding the use of 'sorry' and employing proper induction, case analysis, and simplification tactics as demonstrated in this proof.\n\n5. Consider implementing a pre-proof environment check to catch and address any potential system-level issues before beginning the actual proof process.",
