    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_assoc theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're working with a custom datatype 'mynat' and a custom addition function 'myadd'.\n   - We need to prove the associativity of 'myadd': myadd n (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd n m) p\n\n2. Induction strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on 'n' (the first argument of myadd).\n   - This is because the myadd function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n3. Base case:\n   - Prove the theorem for n = MyZero\n   - This should be straightforward using the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n4. Inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some n\n   - Prove it holds for MySuc n\n   - This will involve applying the definition of myadd for the MySuc case\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Use simp or auto tactics to simplify expressions where possible\n   - This can help in reducing complex expressions to more manageable forms\n\n6. Rewriting:\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal\n   - This is crucial for completing the inductive step\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Once both base case and inductive step are proved, the theorem is established by induction\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to unfold the definition of myadd multiple times\n   - May need to use the associativity property within the proof itself\n\n9. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without any remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of the custom addition function myadd. By following these steps, the player should be able to construct a valid proof in Isabelle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe immediate priority is to correct the syntax error in the 'myadd' function declaration. The arrow symbols used (â‡’) are causing a lexical error. We need to replace these with the correct Isabelle arrow symbols (\\<Rightarrow>).\n\nOnce this is corrected, the proof structure seems to be on the right track. The induction on 'n' has been correctly applied, and the base case (MyZero) has been solved using simplification.\n\nFor the next step, we should focus on completing the inductive step (MySuc case). Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Replace the 'sorry' with actual proof steps.\n2. Start by applying the definition of 'myadd' for the MySuc case on both sides of the equation.\n3. Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal.\n4. Apply simplification tactics (simp or auto) to reduce the expressions.\n5. If needed, use the associativity property within the proof itself.\n\nRemember to unfold the definition of 'myadd' as necessary and be prepared to apply it multiple times.\n\nThe goal is to show that if the theorem holds for n, it also holds for MySuc n, thereby completing the inductive proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation and the past actions, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete, relying on 'sorry' to finish the inductive step for the MySuc case.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'sorry' with a structured proof for the MySuc case, utilizing the induction hypothesis and applying the definition of 'myadd' strategically.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is correct, and the base case (MyZero) has been successfully proven. However, the inductive step (MySuc case) is incomplete, as it's currently using 'sorry' instead of a proper proof.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should focus on the MySuc case. Here's a more detailed strategy:\n\n1. Start by applying the definition of 'myadd' to both sides of the equation in the MySuc case.\n2. Use the induction hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal. The induction hypothesis states that the theorem holds for n, so we can use it to simplify expressions involving n.\n3. Apply simplification tactics (simp or auto) to reduce the expressions further.\n4. If needed, use the associativity property within the proof itself, possibly requiring additional lemmas or explicit rewriting steps.\n\nIt's important to note that the use of 'sorry' indicates an incomplete proof, which we need to avoid for a rigorous certification. By replacing it with actual proof steps, we'll be able to complete the proof and achieve our goal of proving the associativity of 'myadd'.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing these steps for the MySuc case, potentially breaking it down into smaller, manageable proof obligations if necessary. This approach will lead to a complete and rigorous proof of the add_assoc theorem.",
