    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_assoc theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're working with a custom datatype 'mynat' and a custom addition function 'myadd'.\n   - We need to prove the associativity of 'myadd': myadd n (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd n m) p\n\n2. Induction strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on 'n' (the first argument of myadd).\n   - This is because the myadd function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n3. Base case:\n   - Prove the theorem for n = MyZero\n   - This should be straightforward using the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n4. Inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some n\n   - Prove it holds for MySuc n\n   - This will involve applying the definition of myadd for the MySuc case\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Use simp or auto tactics to simplify expressions where possible\n   - This can help in reducing complex expressions to more manageable forms\n\n6. Rewriting:\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal\n   - This is crucial for completing the inductive step\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Once both base case and inductive step are proved, the theorem is established by induction\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to unfold the definition of myadd multiple times\n   - May need to use the associativity property within the proof itself\n\n9. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without any remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of the custom addition function myadd. By following these steps, the player should be able to construct a valid proof in Isabelle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current observation, we need to address the lexical error caused by the use of unicode characters. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Character Replacement: The primary issue is the use of the unicode arrow (⇒) instead of its ASCII equivalent (=>). We need to replace all instances of ⇒ with => in the theory file.\n\n2. Systematic Review: While focusing on the arrow symbol, it's prudent to review the entire file for any other unicode characters that might cause similar issues. Common replacements might include:\n   - ∧ to /\\\n   - ∨ to \\/\n   - ¬ to ~\n   - ∀ to !\n   - ∃ to ?\n\n3. Syntax Correction: After making these replacements, the fun definition for myadd should look like:\n   fun myadd :: \"mynat => mynat => mynat\" where\n     \"myadd MyZero m = m\" |\n     \"myadd (MySuc n) m = MySuc (myadd n m)\"\n\n4. Proof Preservation: The logical structure and steps of the proof remain correct. Once the lexical issues are resolved, the existing proof structure should be valid.\n\n5. Verification: After making these changes, we should attempt to reload the theory file. If successful, Isabelle should be able to parse the file without lexical errors.\n\n6. Next Steps: Assuming the lexical error is resolved, we can proceed with verifying that the proof is complete and accepted by Isabelle. If any issues remain, they will likely be related to the logical structure of the proof rather than syntax errors.\n\nThis reasoning provides a clear path to resolve the immediate issue and continue with the proof verification process.\n",
