    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the add_assoc theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're working with a custom datatype 'mynat' and a custom addition function 'myadd'.\n   - We need to prove the associativity of 'myadd': myadd n (myadd m p) = myadd (myadd n m) p\n\n2. Induction strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on 'n' (the first argument of myadd).\n   - This is because the myadd function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n3. Base case:\n   - Prove the theorem for n = MyZero\n   - This should be straightforward using the definition of myadd for MyZero\n\n4. Inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some n\n   - Prove it holds for MySuc n\n   - This will involve applying the definition of myadd for the MySuc case\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Use simp or auto tactics to simplify expressions where possible\n   - This can help in reducing complex expressions to more manageable forms\n\n6. Rewriting:\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite parts of the goal\n   - This is crucial for completing the inductive step\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Once both base case and inductive step are proved, the theorem is established by induction\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Be prepared to unfold the definition of myadd multiple times\n   - May need to use the associativity property within the proof itself\n\n9. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure all proof obligations are discharged\n   - Check that Isabelle accepts the proof without any remaining subgoals\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of the custom addition function myadd. By following these steps, the player should be able to construct a valid proof in Isabelle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the successful proof attempt and the reflection on the technical issues, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Proof Validity: The proof strategy for the add_assoc theorem was correct and successful. It used structural induction on 'n', handled both the base case and inductive step properly, and utilized simplification tactics effectively.\n\n2. Environment Issues: The current observation indicates problems with the Isabelle environment, specifically related to database access and constraints. These issues are external to the proof itself and need to be addressed at the system level.\n\n3. Next Steps:\n   a. Environment Troubleshooting: Before proceeding with any further proofs or modifications, it's crucial to resolve the Isabelle environment issues. This may involve:\n      - Checking and correcting file permissions for the Isabelle database and related files.\n      - Ensuring the database is not in a read-only state and hasn't been unexpectedly moved.\n      - Verifying the integrity of the Isabelle session database.\n      - Possibly restarting the Isabelle environment or reloading the theory file.\n\n   b. Proof Verification: Once the environment issues are resolved, re-run the existing proof to ensure it can be properly saved and exported without errors.\n\n   c. Proof Refinement (if needed): Although the proof is correct, consider if there are any opportunities for optimization or clarity improvements. For example:\n      - Combining some of the proof steps for conciseness.\n      - Adding comments to explain key steps in the proof for better readability.\n\n4. Future Proofs: For upcoming theorems or lemmas:\n   - Maintain the rigorous proof construction demonstrated in this proof.\n   - Continue using induction, case analysis, and simplification tactics appropriately.\n   - Implement a pre-proof environment check to catch potential system-level issues early.\n\n5. Documentation: Consider documenting the environment issues faced and their resolution for future reference, as this could be helpful for troubleshooting similar issues in the future.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on resolving the environment issues as the primary next step, followed by verifying the existing proof's integrity in the system once those issues are addressed.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered a lexical error due to the use of unicode characters (⇒) instead of ASCII representation (=>).\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of the unicode arrow (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) in the theory file to ensure compatibility and proper parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that while the proof strategy itself was correct, the use of unicode characters in the theory file is causing parsing issues. The improvement suggests a simple but crucial change to use ASCII representation instead, which should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to properly parse and process the theory file.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Go through the entire theory file and replace all instances of ⇒ with =>.\n2. Double-check for any other unicode characters that might cause similar issues and replace them with their ASCII equivalents.\n3. After making these changes, attempt to reload and process the theory file again.\n4. If successful, verify that the proof can now be properly parsed and checked by Isabelle.\n\nThis adjustment should address the immediate parsing issue and allow for the successful execution of the proof. It's also a good practice for future theory development to consistently use ASCII representations for logical symbols to avoid similar parsing errors.",
