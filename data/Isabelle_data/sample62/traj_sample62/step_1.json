    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem structure:\n   - The theorem involves universal quantification (\\<And>x) and implications.\n   - The assumption uses separate implications (P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x \\<longrightarrow> R x).\n   - The conclusion combines P x and Q x with a conjunction (P x \\<and> Q x \\<longrightarrow> R x).\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   a. Start with the `proof` command to begin the proof.\n   b. Use the `fix` command to introduce an arbitrary x.\n   c. Use the `assume` command to introduce the antecedent of the conclusion.\n   d. Apply the assumption to derive R x from P x and Q x.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce x: fix x\n   b. Assume the antecedent: assume \"P x \\<and> Q x\"\n   c. Extract P x and Q x from the assumption\n   d. Apply the main assumption to derive R x\n   e. Show that R x follows from the assumption\n\n4. Consider potential proof techniques:\n   - Use of conjunction elimination rules\n   - Application of the assumption as an inference rule\n   - Possibly use the `show` command to state the goal explicitly\n\n5. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the universal quantifier\n   - Properly manage the transformation from separate implications to a single implication with a conjunction\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use `qed` to finish the proof\n\nThis plan should provide a structured approach to proving the theorem forall_ex1 in Isabelle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We need to break down the assumption \"P x âˆ§ Q x\" into its components. This can be done using the 'conjE' rule or by directly referring to the conjuncts.\n\n2. Once we have separate facts for P x and Q x, we can apply the given premise \"\\<And>x. P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x \\<longrightarrow> R x\" to these facts. This premise is essentially a function that takes P x and Q x as inputs and produces R x as output.\n\n3. After applying the premise, we should obtain R x, which is exactly what we need to prove.\n\n4. To make the proof structure clear, we should use the 'show' command to explicitly state that we're proving R x.\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps in Isabelle syntax, likely using commands like 'from', 'have', and 'show' to structure the proof logically. The proof should proceed by extracting P x and Q x from the assumption, then using these along with the given premise to derive R x, and finally showing that R x holds.\n",
