    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for mul_0_r: \"mymul n MyZero = MyZero\"\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that multiplying any natural number n by zero (MyZero) should result in zero.\n   - We need to prove this using the given definitions of mynat, myadd, and mymul.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Structural induction on n seems appropriate, as mymul is defined recursively.\n\n3. Set up the induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove the base case:\n   - Show that mymul MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of mymul\n\n5. Prove the inductive step:\n   - Assume mymul n MyZero = MyZero (induction hypothesis)\n   - Show that mymul (MySuc n) MyZero = MyZero\n   - Use the definition of mymul for MySuc n\n   - Simplify using the definition of myadd and the induction hypothesis\n\n6. Apply simplification and rewriting:\n   - Use the definitions of mymul and myadd throughout the proof\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Complete the proof:\n   - Conclude that the theorem holds for all mynat n by the principle of structural induction\n\n8. Review and refine:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check for any missing cases or assumptions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current observation, here's the reasoning to guide the next proving operation:\n\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The primary issue is the use of non-ASCII characters in the function type definitions. We need to replace all occurrences of 'â‡’' with '=>' in the theory file. This applies specifically to the definitions of 'myadd' and 'mymul' functions.\n\n2. Preserve Logical Structure:\n   While making these syntax corrections, it's crucial to maintain the logical structure of the proof. The inductive approach and the steps within the proof appear to be correct, so we should not alter the proof strategy itself.\n\n3. Systematic Review:\n   After making the necessary replacements, a systematic review of the entire theory file should be conducted to ensure no other non-ASCII characters or syntax issues are present.\n\n4. Rerun and Verify:\n   Once the syntax corrections are made, we should attempt to rerun the proof in Isabelle. If successful, we can then focus on verifying that Isabelle accepts the proof and confirms the theorem.\n\n5. Prepare for Further Refinement:\n   If the proof is accepted after these syntax corrections, we should be prepared to analyze any feedback or output from Isabelle to determine if further refinements or clarifications are needed in the proof structure or steps.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these syntax corrections while preserving the logical structure of the proof. This should allow us to progress past the current parsing error and move forward with evaluating the correctness of the proof itself in Isabelle.\n",
