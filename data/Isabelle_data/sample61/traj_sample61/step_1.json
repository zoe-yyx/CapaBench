    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for mul_0_r: \"mymul n MyZero = MyZero\"\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that multiplying any natural number n by zero (MyZero) should result in zero.\n   - We need to prove this using the given definitions of mynat, myadd, and mymul.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Structural induction on n seems appropriate, as mymul is defined recursively.\n\n3. Set up the induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove the base case:\n   - Show that mymul MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of mymul\n\n5. Prove the inductive step:\n   - Assume mymul n MyZero = MyZero (induction hypothesis)\n   - Show that mymul (MySuc n) MyZero = MyZero\n   - Use the definition of mymul for MySuc n\n   - Simplify using the definition of myadd and the induction hypothesis\n\n6. Apply simplification and rewriting:\n   - Use the definitions of mymul and myadd throughout the proof\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Complete the proof:\n   - Conclude that the theorem holds for all mynat n by the principle of structural induction\n\n8. Review and refine:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check for any missing cases or assumptions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof of the inductive step for \"mymul n MyZero = MyZero\", we need to:\n\n1. Start with the left-hand side of the equation for the MySuc case: mymul (MySuc n) MyZero\n\n2. Expand this using the definition of mymul for MySuc:\n   mymul (MySuc n) MyZero = myadd MyZero (mymul n MyZero)\n\n3. Apply the induction hypothesis to simplify (mymul n MyZero) to MyZero:\n   myadd MyZero (mymul n MyZero) = myadd MyZero MyZero\n\n4. Use the definition of myadd with MyZero as the first argument:\n   myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n\n5. This completes the chain of equalities, showing that:\n   mymul (MySuc n) MyZero = MyZero\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps in Isabelle, using the appropriate tactics to rewrite and simplify expressions at each step. This will likely involve using 'simp' with specific definitions and the induction hypothesis, possibly combined with 'auto' for basic simplifications.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof appears to be correct, but there's an issue with the Isabelle environment or database causing a SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY error.\n\nImprovement: The proving process and reasoning are sound, so we need to focus on resolving the technical issue with the Isabelle environment or database setup before proceeding with further proofs.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current issue is not with the proof itself, but rather with the underlying system running Isabelle. The proof structure and steps appear to be correct and complete for the target theorem \"mul_0_r\". \n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. The planning agent should consider including a step to check and ensure the proper setup of the Isabelle environment before starting the proof process.\n\n2. The reasoning agent should continue with the current approach for future theorems, as the logical steps were correct.\n\n3. The acting agent should investigate the SQLite database issue. This might involve:\n   - Checking for duplicate entries in the isabelle_session_info table\n   - Ensuring proper database permissions\n   - Verifying the integrity of the Isabelle installation\n\n4. For future actions, it may be helpful to include error handling or environment checking steps to catch such issues early in the process.\n\n5. If the database issue persists, consider reaching out to Isabelle support or consulting documentation on proper database setup for Isabelle sessions.\n\nThe overall goal of proving the problem successfully has been theoretically achieved in terms of the logical steps. The focus now should be on resolving the technical hurdle to get Isabelle to properly process and verify the proof.",
