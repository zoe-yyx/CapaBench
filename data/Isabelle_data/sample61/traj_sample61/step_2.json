    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for mul_0_r: \"mymul n MyZero = MyZero\"\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that multiplying any natural number n by zero (MyZero) should result in zero.\n   - We need to prove this using the given definitions of mynat, myadd, and mymul.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Structural induction on n seems appropriate, as mymul is defined recursively.\n\n3. Set up the induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove the base case:\n   - Show that mymul MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of mymul\n\n5. Prove the inductive step:\n   - Assume mymul n MyZero = MyZero (induction hypothesis)\n   - Show that mymul (MySuc n) MyZero = MyZero\n   - Use the definition of mymul for MySuc n\n   - Simplify using the definition of myadd and the induction hypothesis\n\n6. Apply simplification and rewriting:\n   - Use the definitions of mymul and myadd throughout the proof\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Complete the proof:\n   - Conclude that the theorem holds for all mynat n by the principle of structural induction\n\n8. Review and refine:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check for any missing cases or assumptions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the current situation, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. The proof structure for the theorem \"mul_0_r\" is logically sound and complete. The induction approach, base case, and inductive step are all correctly formulated.\n\n2. The SQLite constraint error is not related to the proof itself but to the Isabelle environment or database setup. This is a technical issue rather than a logical one.\n\n3. Since the proof is already written and appears to be correct, we don't need to modify the proof content itself.\n\n4. The next step should be to address the technical issue preventing Isabelle from processing the proof. This may involve:\n\n   a) Checking the Isabelle installation and ensuring all components are up-to-date.\n   b) Verifying the integrity of the SQLite database used by Isabelle.\n   c) Investigating potential conflicts or duplicates in the isabelle_session_info table.\n   d) Ensuring proper permissions for the database and Isabelle working directory.\n\n5. Once the technical issue is resolved, the acting agent should attempt to rerun the proof without changes, as the logical structure is already correct.\n\n6. If the proof runs successfully after fixing the technical issue, the next step would be to verify that Isabelle accepts the proof and confirms the theorem.\n\n7. In case the technical issue persists, it may be necessary to consult Isabelle documentation or support channels for more specific troubleshooting steps related to database constraints and session management.\n\nThe key point is that the focus should shift from proof construction to environment troubleshooting, as the logical aspect of the proof appears to be complete and correct.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof contains non-ASCII characters (⇒) which are causing lexical errors in Isabelle's parsing of the theory file.\n\nImprovement: Replace all occurrences of the non-ASCII arrow (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) in the type signatures of functions to ensure proper parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the main issue is not with the logical structure of the proof, but with the syntax used in the theory file. The use of non-ASCII characters, specifically the double arrow (⇒), is causing Isabelle to fail in parsing the type definitions.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should carefully review the entire theory file and replace all instances of ⇒ with =>.\n\n2. Special attention should be paid to the function definitions for myadd and mymul, as these are explicitly mentioned in the error message.\n\n3. After making these replacements, the acting agent should attempt to rerun the proof.\n\n4. If successful, the reasoning agent can then focus on verifying that the proof is accepted by Isabelle and confirms the theorem.\n\n5. If other syntax issues arise, a similar approach of identifying non-standard characters or syntax and replacing them with Isabelle-compatible alternatives should be taken.\n\nThis approach addresses the immediate syntactical issue while preserving the logical structure of the proof, which appeared to be correct in its reasoning. By fixing these syntax issues, we should be able to progress to actually evaluating the correctness of the proof itself in Isabelle.",
