Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that multiplying any natural number n by zero (MyZero) should result in zero.\n   - We need to prove this using the given definitions of mynat, myadd, and mymul.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Structural induction on n seems appropriate, as mymul is defined recursively.\n\n3. Set up the induction:\n   - Base case: n = MyZero\n   - Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for n, prove for MySuc n\n\n4. Prove the base case:\n   - Show that mymul MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of mymul\n\n5. Prove the inductive step:\n   - Assume mymul n MyZero = MyZero (induction hypothesis)\n   - Show that mymul (MySuc n) MyZero = MyZero\n   - Use the definition of mymul for MySuc n\n   - Simplify using the definition of myadd and the induction hypothesis\n\n6. Apply simplification and rewriting:\n   - Use the definitions of mymul and myadd throughout the proof\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis when necessary\n\n7. Complete the proof:\n   - Conclude that the theorem holds for all mynat n by the principle of structural induction\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem description and the planning strategy, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. Start by applying induction on the variable n. This is because the function mymul is defined recursively, and we need to prove the property for all natural numbers.\n\n2. For the induction proof, we'll need to handle two cases:\n   a) Base case: n = MyZero\n   b) Inductive step: n = MySuc n'\n\n3. For the base case (n = MyZero):\n   - We need to show that mymul MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n   - This should follow directly from the first equation in the definition of mymul\n\n4. For the inductive step (n = MySuc n'):\n   - We assume the induction hypothesis: mymul n' MyZero = MyZero\n   - We need to prove: mymul (MySuc n') MyZero = MyZero\n   - We should use the second equation in the definition of mymul\n   - Then, we'll need to use the definition of myadd and simplify\n\n5. Throughout the proof, we should use simplification (simp) with the definitions of mymul and myadd as needed.\n\n6. After proving both cases, the principle of structural induction will complete the proof for all mynat n.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n and then proceed with proving the base case.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete and uses 'sorry' in the inductive step, which is not a rigorous proof.\n\nImprovement: Complete the inductive step by explicitly expanding the definition of mymul, using the induction hypothesis, and simplifying with the properties of myadd.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The current result is unsatisfactory because the proof is incomplete. While the base case (MyZero) is correctly proven using simplification, the inductive step (MySuc n) is left unproven with a 'sorry' statement.\n\n2. The effectiveness of past actions was mixed. The structure of the proof using induction was correct, and the base case was handled properly. However, the crucial inductive step was not completed.\n\n3. For improvement, we need to focus on completing the inductive step. Here's a suggested approach:\n   - Start by expanding the definition of mymul for the MySuc case.\n   - Use the induction hypothesis to simplify the recursive call.\n   - Apply the definition of myadd and simplify the result.\n\n4. To align with the overall goal of proving the problem successfully, we need to ensure that each step in the proof is rigorous and complete. This means avoiding the use of 'sorry' and instead providing explicit reasoning for each step.\n\n5. The use of 'sorry' in the current proof is a clear indication that the proof is not complete. We need to replace this with a proper proof of the inductive step.\n\nFor the next round, the acting agent should focus on completing the inductive step of the proof. This will involve carefully applying the definitions of mymul and myadd, using the induction hypothesis, and simplifying the resulting expressions until we reach the desired conclusion that mymul (MySuc n) MyZero = MyZero.",
