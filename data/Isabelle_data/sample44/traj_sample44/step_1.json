Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the \"iff\" (if and only if) proof technique\n   - Prove both directions of the bi-implication:\n     a) (P ∨ Q → R) ⟹ (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     b) (P → R) ∧ (Q → R) ⟹ (P ∨ Q → R)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   3.1. Start with \"apply (rule iffI)\" to split into two subgoals\n\n   3.2. For the forward direction (⟹):\n     - Assume (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Show (P → R) and (Q → R) separately\n     - Use case analysis on P and Q\n\n   3.3. For the backward direction (⟸):\n     - Assume (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     - Show (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Use case analysis on (P ∨ Q)\n\n4. Utilize Isabelle's proof methods:\n   - Apply \"rule\" for introducing implications\n   - Use \"case\" for case analysis\n   - Employ \"assumption\" when applicable\n   - Finish with \"done\" when the proof is complete\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Isabelle\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the forward direction of the proof, we need to show that (P → R) ∧ (Q → R) follows from the assumption (P ∨ Q → R). Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We already have the assumption \"(P ∨ Q → R)\".\n\n2. To prove \"(P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\", we need to show both conjuncts separately and then combine them.\n\n3. For (P → R):\n   - Assume P\n   - From P, we can deduce P ∨ Q\n   - Apply the assumption (P ∨ Q → R) to derive R\n   - This establishes P → R\n\n4. For (Q → R):\n   - Assume Q\n   - From Q, we can deduce P ∨ Q\n   - Apply the assumption (P ∨ Q → R) to derive R\n   - This establishes Q → R\n\n5. Once both implications are proved, use the 'conjI' rule to combine them into (P → R) ∧ (Q → R).\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps using appropriate Isabelle tactics, such as 'show', 'assume', 'have', and applying rules like 'disjI1', 'disjI2', 'mp' (modus ponens), and 'conjI'.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete as it doesn't finish proving the second direction of the bi-implication, and the use of 'oops' indicates an unfinished proof.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'oops' command and complete the proof of the second direction by showing that \"P ∨ Q → R\" follows from \"(P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\" using case analysis on \"P ∨ Q\".\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt has successfully proven the forward direction of the bi-implication, which is a good start. However, there are two main issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The proof of the second direction (right-to-left) is incomplete. The proof structure is set up correctly with the 'next' keyword, but it ends with 'oops', which is used to skip unfinished proofs. This needs to be replaced with a complete proof.\n\n2. The 'qed' command at the end is causing an error because the proof is not actually complete.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Complete the second direction of the proof. This can be done by:\n   - Assuming \"(P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\"\n   - Showing \"P ∨ Q → R\" by case analysis on \"P ∨ Q\"\n   - For each case (P and Q), use the corresponding implication from the assumption to derive R\n\n2. Remove the 'oops' command and replace it with the actual proof steps.\n\n3. Ensure that all proof obligations are met before using 'qed' to close the proof.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing these steps to complete the proof. This will involve using tactics like 'case', 'show', and applying rules like 'conjE' to extract the individual implications from the assumption.",
