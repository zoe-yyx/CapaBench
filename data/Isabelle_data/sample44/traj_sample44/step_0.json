    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem \"or_imply: (P ∨ Q → R) ↔ (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\", we should follow the outlined plan. As this is the start of the proof, we need to initiate the proof process and split the bi-implication into two directions.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. Start the proof by applying the \"iffI\" rule. This will split our theorem into two subgoals, representing the two directions of the bi-implication:\n   a) (P ∨ Q → R) ⟹ (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n   b) (P → R) ∧ (Q → R) ⟹ (P ∨ Q → R)\n\n2. After applying this rule, we'll focus on proving the forward direction first (⟹).\n\n3. For the forward direction, we need to assume (P ∨ Q → R) and show that both (P → R) and (Q → R) hold.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by applying the \"iffI\" rule to set up the structure for the bi-directional proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the provided information, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was incomplete and used 'oops' to skip unproven parts, which is not a rigorous approach to theorem proving.\nImprovement: Replace 'oops' with proper proof steps, focusing on completing the forward direction first by showing that (P → R) and (Q → R) hold given the assumption (P ∨ Q → R).\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The current proof structure is correct, as it uses the 'iffI' rule to split the bi-implication into two directions. However, the use of 'oops' indicates that the actual proof steps are missing.\n\n2. For the forward direction, we need to prove that given (P ∨ Q → R), both (P → R) and (Q → R) hold. This can be done by:\n   a) Assuming P and showing R\n   b) Assuming Q and showing R\n   c) Combining these results using the 'conjI' rule\n\n3. For the backward direction, we need to prove that given (P → R) ∧ (Q → R), we can conclude (P ∨ Q → R). This can be done by:\n   a) Assuming P ∨ Q\n   b) Using case analysis on this disjunction\n   c) In each case, using the appropriate implication to derive R\n\n4. The error message about a SQLite constraint is not directly related to the proof itself and might be an issue with the Isabelle environment or database. This should not affect the logical structure of the proof.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should focus on completing the forward direction of the proof, replacing the first 'oops' with actual proof steps. This will involve assuming P and Q separately, showing that R holds in each case, and then combining these results to prove (P → R) ∧ (Q → R).",
