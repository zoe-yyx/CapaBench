Outline the proof steps:\n   3.1. Start with \"apply (rule iffI)\" to split into two subgoals\n\n   3.2. For the forward direction (⟹):\n     - Assume (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Show (P → R) and (Q → R) separately\n     - Use case analysis on P and Q\n\n   3.3.

    "reasoning": "\nTo address the issue in the second part of the proof, we should restructure it as follows:\n\n1. Start with the assumption \"(P ⟶ R) ∧ (Q ⟶ R)\".\n2. Use 'show \"P ∨ Q ⟶ R\"' to state our goal.\n3. Apply the rule 'impI' to introduce the implication.\n4. Then, use 'cases \"P ∨ Q\"' to split into two cases: P and Q.\n5. For each case:\n   a. Extract the relevant implication from the assumption using 'conjunct1' or 'conjunct2'.\n   b. Apply this implication to the case hypothesis using 'mp' (modus ponens).\n\nThis approach will explicitly handle both cases of the disjunction and correctly apply the assumed implications. We'll avoid using 'by' and instead use more detailed proof steps to ensure each logical step is clear and verifiable by Isabelle.\n\nThe acting agent should implement this revised structure, focusing on clear, step-by-step proof construction for the second part of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails at line 32 due to an incomplete or incorrect application of the modus ponens rule.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'by' command with explicit proof steps using 'from' and 'show' to clearly demonstrate the application of modus ponens.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is mostly correct, but the issue arises in the application of modus ponens. The 'by' command is attempting to automatically apply the rule, but it's failing to connect the pieces properly. \n\nTo improve this, we should break down the modus ponens application into explicit steps. Instead of using 'by (rule mp)', we should use a more verbose proof structure that clearly shows how we're using the assumptions to derive the conclusion.\n\nFor example, we could replace:\n\n```\nwith `P` show \"R\" by (rule mp)\n```\n\nwith:\n\n```\nfrom `P \\<longrightarrow> R` and `P` show \"R\" by (rule mp)\n```\n\nThis explicitly shows that we're using both the implication (P ⟶ R) and the assumption (P) to conclude R.\n\nWe should apply this change in both cases of the proof (for P and for Q). By making these steps more explicit, we give Isabelle clearer instructions on how to apply the logical rules, which should resolve the current failure.\n\nAdditionally, we should ensure that all assumptions and derived facts are properly referenced throughout the proof. This includes using 'assm' when referring to the initial assumption, and properly quoting or referencing intermediate steps.\n\nFor future actions, the acting agent should focus on implementing these more explicit proof steps, avoiding the use of 'by' for complex logical steps, and ensuring all assumptions and facts are clearly referenced throughout the proof.",
