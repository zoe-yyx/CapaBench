    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves a bi-implication (<->)\n   - Left side: (P ∨ Q → R)\n   - Right side: (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the \"iff\" (if and only if) proof technique\n   - Prove both directions of the bi-implication:\n     a) (P ∨ Q → R) ⟹ (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     b) (P → R) ∧ (Q → R) ⟹ (P ∨ Q → R)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   3.1. Start with \"apply (rule iffI)\" to split into two subgoals\n\n   3.2. For the forward direction (⟹):\n     - Assume (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Show (P → R) and (Q → R) separately\n     - Use case analysis on P and Q\n\n   3.3. For the backward direction (⟸):\n     - Assume (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     - Show (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Use case analysis on (P ∨ Q)\n\n4. Utilize Isabelle's proof methods:\n   - Apply \"rule\" for introducing implications\n   - Use \"case\" for case analysis\n   - Employ \"assumption\" when applicable\n   - Finish with \"done\" when the proof is complete\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Isabelle\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, our reasoning should focus on addressing the technical issue while maintaining confidence in the correctness of our proof. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. The proof structure and logic appear to be correct and complete. We've successfully proven both directions of the bi-implication as planned.\n\n2. The error message indicates a database constraint issue, specifically a primary key violation in the 'isabelle_session_info' table. This suggests that the problem is not with our proof but with the Isabelle environment or session management.\n\n3. To proceed, we should try to isolate the proof from potential session conflicts. We can do this by:\n   a) Attempting to run the proof in a new, uniquely named session.\n   b) Clearing any existing session data before rerunning the proof.\n   c) Saving the proof in a separate file and loading it in a fresh Isabelle instance.\n\n4. If the database issue persists, we may need to investigate the Isabelle environment setup, focusing on:\n   a) Database configurations\n   b) Session management settings\n   c) Any recent changes to the Isabelle installation or environment\n\n5. As a last resort, if we cannot resolve the database issue immediately, we should consider alternative ways to verify the proof, such as:\n   a) Using a different Isabelle installation or environment\n   b) Manually reviewing the proof logic\n   c) Seeking assistance from Isabelle system administrators\n\n6. Throughout this process, we should maintain confidence in our proof's correctness and focus on overcoming the technical hurdle to allow Isabelle to properly process and verify our work.\n\nGiven these considerations, the acting agent should first attempt to run the proof in a new, uniquely named session or after clearing existing session data. If this doesn't resolve the issue, we should proceed with saving the proof in a separate file and attempting to load it in a fresh Isabelle instance.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but there's an issue with applying the proof method at line 32, specifically in the case where P is true.\n\nImprovement: We need to modify the proof structure to explicitly handle the cases where P is true and where Q is true separately, ensuring that each case correctly applies the appropriate implication from the assumption.\n```\n\nThe error message indicates that the proof method failed to apply at line 32, which is in the second part of the proof where we're showing \"P ∨ Q ⟶ R\" given \"(P ⟶ R) ∧ (Q ⟶ R)\". The specific issue arises when trying to prove R from P and P ⟶ R.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Restructure the proof to explicitly handle the cases for P and Q separately.\n2. Ensure that we're correctly extracting and applying the individual implications from the conjunction in our assumption.\n3. Use more explicit proof steps, possibly avoiding the use of the 'by' keyword in favor of more detailed proof blocks.\n4. Consider using different proof methods or tactics that might be more suitable for this type of logical implication.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on rewriting the second part of the proof, paying special attention to how we handle the disjunction cases and apply the assumed implications. We should also consider using methods like 'apply' followed by specific tactics instead of 'by' to have more control over each step of the proof.",
