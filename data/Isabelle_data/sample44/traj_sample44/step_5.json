    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves a bi-implication (<->)\n   - Left side: (P ∨ Q → R)\n   - Right side: (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the \"iff\" (if and only if) proof technique\n   - Prove both directions of the bi-implication:\n     a) (P ∨ Q → R) ⟹ (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     b) (P → R) ∧ (Q → R) ⟹ (P ∨ Q → R)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   3.1. Start with \"apply (rule iffI)\" to split into two subgoals\n\n   3.2. For the forward direction (⟹):\n     - Assume (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Show (P → R) and (Q → R) separately\n     - Use case analysis on P and Q\n\n   3.3. For the backward direction (⟸):\n     - Assume (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     - Show (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Use case analysis on (P ∨ Q)\n\n4. Utilize Isabelle's proof methods:\n   - Apply \"rule\" for introducing implications\n   - Use \"case\" for case analysis\n   - Employ \"assumption\" when applicable\n   - Finish with \"done\" when the proof is complete\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Isabelle\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is correct, but we need to make the application of modus ponens (mp) more explicit in both cases of the proof. Here's how we should modify the proof:\n\n1. In the first part of the proof (P → R):\n   - We need to clearly state that we're using both the implication from the assumption and the case assumption.\n   - Replace \"with `P` show \"R\" by (rule mp)\" with a more explicit form.\n\n2. In the second part of the proof (Q → R):\n   - Similarly, we need to make the modus ponens application explicit.\n   - Use the same structure as in the first part, but for Q instead of P.\n\n3. For both parts:\n   - Ensure we're properly referencing the initial assumption 'assm'.\n   - Use 'from' to clearly indicate which facts we're using in each step.\n\n4. General approach:\n   - Avoid using 'by' for complex logical steps. Instead, use a more verbose proof structure.\n   - Make sure each logical step is clearly stated and justified.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these changes, particularly in the last part of the proof where the error occurred. This should resolve the current failure and complete the proof successfully.\n",
