Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the \"iff\" (if and only if) proof technique\n   - Prove both directions of the bi-implication:\n     a) (P ∨ Q → R) ⟹ (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     b) (P → R) ∧ (Q → R) ⟹ (P ∨ Q → R)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   3.1. Start with \"apply (rule iffI)\" to split into two subgoals\n\n   3.2. For the forward direction (⟹):\n     - Assume (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Show (P → R) and (Q → R) separately\n     - Use case analysis on P and Q\n\n   3.3. For the backward direction (⟸):\n     - Assume (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n     - Show (P ∨ Q → R)\n     - Use case analysis on (P ∨ Q)\n\n4. Utilize Isabelle's proof methods:\n   - Apply \"rule\" for introducing implications\n   - Use \"case\" for case analysis\n   - Employ \"assumption\" when applicable\n   - Finish with \"done\" when the proof is complete\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We need to complete the proof of the second direction (right-to-left) of the bi-implication. This involves showing that \"(P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\" implies \"P ∨ Q → R\".\n\n2. The proof structure for this direction is already set up with the 'next' keyword, so we can continue from there.\n\n3. We should use case analysis on \"P ∨ Q\" to prove \"P ∨ Q → R\". This can be done using the 'proof' command followed by '(cases \"P ∨ Q\")'.\n\n4. For each case:\n   - When P is true, we can use the \"P → R\" part of our assumption to conclude R.\n   - When Q is true, we can use the \"Q → R\" part of our assumption to conclude R.\n\n5. We need to use the 'conjE' rule to extract the individual implications from our assumption \"(P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\".\n\n6. After completing both cases, we can close the proof with 'qed' instead of 'oops'.\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps, using appropriate Isabelle tactics and rules to complete the proof. This approach will address the incompleteness issue and should resolve the error with the 'qed' command.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof appears to be complete and correct, but there is a database-related error preventing successful execution.\n\nImprovement: The LLM agents should focus on resolving the database constraint issue, possibly by ensuring unique session names or addressing any underlying database configuration problems.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the actual proof logic seems sound, but we're encountering a technical issue rather than a problem with the proof itself. The error message suggests a database constraint violation, specifically related to a primary key in the 'isabelle_session_info' table.\n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. The planning agent should investigate the Isabelle environment setup, focusing on database configurations and session management.\n\n2. The reasoning agent should consider if there are any Isabelle-specific commands or settings that could help bypass or resolve this database issue.\n\n3. The acting agent should try running the proof again, potentially with a different session name or after clearing any existing session data.\n\n4. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to seek assistance from Isabelle system administrators or consult Isabelle documentation regarding database management and session handling.\n\n5. As a temporary workaround, the agents could consider saving the proof in a separate file and trying to load it in a fresh Isabelle session.\n\nThe key here is to recognize that the proof itself is not the problem, but rather there's an external system issue that needs to be addressed. The next steps should focus on resolving this technical constraint to allow the correct proof to be properly processed and verified by Isabelle.",
