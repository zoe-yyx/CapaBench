Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"not (P implies Q)\" is equivalent to \"P and not Q\"\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to split the theorem into two parts\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Prove left to right direction:\n   - Assume \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use classical reasoning to show that this implies \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Consider using proof by contradiction or case analysis on P and Q\n\n4. Prove right to left direction:\n   - Assume \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Show that this implies \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use the definition of implication and logical negation\n\n5. Possible proof techniques to consider:\n   - Case analysis\n   - Contradiction\n   - Truth tables (for intuition, not formal proof)\n   - Use of basic logical rules and definitions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the negation of an implication\n   - Ensuring all cases are covered in the proof\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review each step to ensure logical consistency\n   - Check that both directions of the iff are properly addressed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the plan outlined in the planning strategy. The first step is to set up the proof structure using the 'iff' method to split the theorem into two directions.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should begin by applying the 'iff' proof method to split the theorem into two parts: the left-to-right direction and the right-to-left direction.\n\n2. This will create two subgoals that we can tackle separately, which aligns with our plan to prove each direction of the equivalence.\n\n3. By starting with this structure, we set ourselves up for a clear and organized proof that addresses both parts of the bidirectional implication.\n\n4. After applying 'iff', we should focus on the left-to-right direction first, as it's typically more challenging and involves dealing with the negation of an implication.\n\n5. For the left-to-right direction, we'll need to assume \"¬(P → Q)\" and show that this implies \"P ∧ ¬Q\". This may involve using classical reasoning techniques such as proof by contradiction or case analysis.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin by applying the 'iff' method to set up the proof structure for both directions of the equivalence.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is incorrectly set up, using 'proof' and 'next' instead of the recommended 'iff' method, leading to syntax errors and an incomplete proof.\n\nImprovement: Restructure the proof using the 'iff' method to properly split the theorem into two directions, and avoid using 'oops' to ensure a rigorous and complete proof.\n```\n\nThe current approach has several issues:\n\n1. The proof structure doesn't follow the recommended 'iff' method, which would have cleanly split the theorem into two directions.\n\n2. The use of 'next' is incorrect in this context, causing a syntax error.\n\n3. The proof attempts are incomplete, ending with 'oops' instead of completing each direction.\n\n4. The overall structure is more complicated than necessary, making it harder to follow the logical flow.\n\nTo improve in the next steps:\n\n1. Start the proof with 'proof (rule iff)' to properly set up the bidirectional proof.\n\n2. Focus on proving each direction separately without using 'next' or 'oops'.\n\n3. For the left-to-right direction, use classical reasoning techniques like proof by contradiction or case analysis.\n\n4. For the right-to-left direction, directly show how \"P ∧ ¬Q\" implies \"¬(P → Q)\".\n\n5. Ensure each direction is fully proved before concluding the theorem.\n\nBy following these suggestions, the proof should be more structured, complete, and aligned with the original plan and the theorem's requirements.",
