    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"not (P implies Q)\" is equivalent to \"P and not Q\"\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to split the theorem into two parts\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Prove left to right direction:\n   - Assume \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use classical reasoning to show that this implies \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Consider using proof by contradiction or case analysis on P and Q\n\n4. Prove right to left direction:\n   - Assume \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Show that this implies \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use the definition of implication and logical negation\n\n5. Possible proof techniques to consider:\n   - Case analysis\n   - Contradiction\n   - Truth tables (for intuition, not formal proof)\n   - Use of basic logical rules and definitions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the negation of an implication\n   - Ensuring all cases are covered in the proof\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review each step to ensure logical consistency\n   - Check that both directions of the iff are properly addressed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof should be restructured using the 'iff' method to properly address both directions of the equivalence. We'll start with the left-to-right direction, which requires more careful reasoning.\n\n1. Begin the proof with 'proof (rule iff)' to set up the bidirectional structure.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction (¬(P → Q) ⟹ P ∧ ¬Q):\n   - Start with the assumption ¬(P → Q)\n   - Use a proof by contradiction:\n     * Assume ¬(P ∧ ¬Q) and aim to derive a contradiction\n     * This assumption is equivalent to ¬P ∨ Q (by De Morgan's law)\n     * Show that this leads to P → Q, contradicting the original assumption\n   - Conclude that P ∧ ¬Q must hold\n\n3. For the right-to-left direction (P ∧ ¬Q ⟹ ¬(P → Q)):\n   - Start with the assumption P ∧ ¬Q\n   - Directly show that P → Q is false:\n     * P is true (from the assumption)\n     * Q is false (from the assumption)\n     * Therefore, P → Q is false (by the definition of implication)\n   - Conclude that ¬(P → Q) holds\n\nThis approach follows a logical progression, addresses both directions of the equivalence, and avoids the syntax errors encountered in the previous attempt.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was successful, but there was an issue with the SQLite database constraint, unrelated to the actual proof.\n\nImprovement: The proof structure and logic are correct, so we should focus on resolving the database issue, possibly by clearing the existing database or ensuring unique session names.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that the proof attempt itself was successful and logically sound. The structure of the proof follows the planned approach, addressing both directions of the equivalence and using appropriate reasoning techniques.\n\nThe error message indicates an issue with the SQLite database, specifically a primary key constraint violation. This suggests that the problem is not with the proof itself, but with the environment or setup in which the proof is being executed.\n\nFor future steps, we should:\n\n1. Investigate the database issue:\n   - Check if there are any existing sessions with the same name that might be causing the conflict.\n   - Consider clearing the database or renaming the current session to ensure uniqueness.\n\n2. Re-run the proof:\n   - Once the database issue is resolved, attempt to run the proof again without any changes to the logic or structure.\n\n3. Verify the output:\n   - After successfully running the proof, carefully review the output to ensure that all steps are accepted by Isabelle and that the theorem is indeed proven.\n\n4. Document the process:\n   - Make note of the database issue and its resolution for future reference, as it may affect other proofs or sessions.\n\nThe current proof structure and reasoning are sound, so no changes to the actual proof content are necessary. The focus should be on resolving the external issue preventing the successful execution of the proof.",
