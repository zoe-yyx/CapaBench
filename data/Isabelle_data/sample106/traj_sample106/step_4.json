    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"not (P implies Q)\" is equivalent to \"P and not Q\"\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to split the theorem into two parts\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Prove left to right direction:\n   - Assume \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use classical reasoning to show that this implies \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Consider using proof by contradiction or case analysis on P and Q\n\n4. Prove right to left direction:\n   - Assume \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Show that this implies \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use the definition of implication and logical negation\n\n5. Possible proof techniques to consider:\n   - Case analysis\n   - Contradiction\n   - Truth tables (for intuition, not formal proof)\n   - Use of basic logical rules and definitions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the negation of an implication\n   - Ensuring all cases are covered in the proof\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review each step to ensure logical consistency\n   - Check that both directions of the iff are properly addressed\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The overall structure of the proof is correct, following the planned bidirectional approach for the iff statement. However, we need to make the logical connections more explicit for Isabelle to verify.\n\n2. We should focus on ensuring that each subproof is properly closed and that the main proof structure is clear. Let's break down the proof into smaller, more explicit steps.\n\n3. For the left-to-right direction (¬(P → Q) ⟹ P ∧ ¬Q):\n   - The use of classical reasoning is appropriate, but we should make the connection to the goal more explicit.\n   - After deriving P ∧ ¬Q, we should explicitly show how this proves the left-to-right direction of the iff statement.\n\n4. For the right-to-left direction (P ∧ ¬Q ⟹ ¬(P → Q)):\n   - The proof by contradiction is correct, but we should make sure to explicitly state that we've proven ¬(P → Q).\n\n5. After proving both directions, we should explicitly state that we've proven the iff statement.\n\n6. To address the \"Failed to refine any pending goal\" error, we should:\n   - Use \"show\" commands more frequently to connect our intermediate results to the overall goal.\n   - Ensure that each nested proof is properly closed with \"qed\" or \"done\".\n   - Consider adding a final \"show\" statement that explicitly states we've proven the theorem.\n\n7. If the proof still fails to close, we might need to break it down further or use more basic tactics to make each step clearer to Isabelle.\n",
