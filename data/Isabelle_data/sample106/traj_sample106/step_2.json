    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"not (P implies Q)\" is equivalent to \"P and not Q\"\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to split the theorem into two parts\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Prove left to right direction:\n   - Assume \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use classical reasoning to show that this implies \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Consider using proof by contradiction or case analysis on P and Q\n\n4. Prove right to left direction:\n   - Assume \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Show that this implies \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use the definition of implication and logical negation\n\n5. Possible proof techniques to consider:\n   - Case analysis\n   - Contradiction\n   - Truth tables (for intuition, not formal proof)\n   - Use of basic logical rules and definitions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the negation of an implication\n   - Ensuring all cases are covered in the proof\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review each step to ensure logical consistency\n   - Check that both directions of the iff are properly addressed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure and logic for the theorem \"not_imply_iff\" are correct and complete. The issue we're facing is not related to the proof itself but to a database constraint in the Isabelle environment. Here's what we should do next:\n\n1. Database Issue Resolution:\n   - The SQLite error suggests a primary key constraint failure, likely due to a duplicate session name.\n   - Before attempting to run the proof again, we need to resolve this database issue.\n   - Recommend clearing the existing database or creating a new, uniquely named session for this proof.\n\n2. Proof Re-execution:\n   - Once the database issue is resolved, we should re-run the entire proof without any changes to its content.\n   - The current proof structure is logically sound and covers both directions of the iff statement as planned.\n\n3. Verification:\n   - After successfully running the proof, carefully review the output to ensure all steps are accepted by Isabelle.\n   - Confirm that the theorem is proven without any remaining goals or errors.\n\n4. Next Steps:\n   - If the proof runs successfully after resolving the database issue, we can consider this theorem proven.\n   - If any unexpected issues arise during re-execution, we may need to review and potentially adjust the proof structure, but this seems unlikely given the current state of the proof.\n\nIn summary, our next action should be to address the database constraint issue, then re-run the existing proof without modifications. The acting agent should focus on resolving the environment setup rather than changing the proof content.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempts to use the \"iff\" rule which is undefined in the current context, leading to a failure in the proof's execution.\n\nImprovement: Replace the usage of the undefined \"iff\" rule with a more basic proof structure, such as using \"show ?thesis\" and proving both directions of the bi-implication separately.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is logically sound, but it relies on a rule that is not available in the current Isabelle environment. This is causing the proof to fail at the very beginning. To address this, we need to restructure our proof to use more fundamental proof techniques that are guaranteed to be available in the basic Isabelle setup.\n\nFor the next steps, I suggest:\n\n1. Start the proof without using the \"rule iff\" command. Instead, use \"show ?thesis\" to state our goal.\n\n2. Prove both directions of the bi-implication separately using nested proofs. This can be done with \"show\" statements for each direction.\n\n3. For each direction, we can maintain the existing logical structure but adjust the syntax to fit Isabelle's basic proof style.\n\n4. Use basic tactics like \"assume\", \"have\", \"show\", and \"by\" (for simple inferences) instead of relying on potentially unavailable rules.\n\n5. If needed, introduce intermediate steps with explicit \"have\" statements to make the logical flow clearer and easier for Isabelle to follow.\n\n6. Double-check that all used tactics and commands are part of Isabelle's core functionality to avoid similar issues in the future.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to construct a proof that Isabelle can process without relying on potentially undefined rules or tactics. This approach will make our proof more robust and portable across different Isabelle setups.",
