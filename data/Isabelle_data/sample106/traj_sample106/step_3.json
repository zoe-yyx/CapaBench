    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"not (P implies Q)\" is equivalent to \"P and not Q\"\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to split the theorem into two parts\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Prove left to right direction:\n   - Assume \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use classical reasoning to show that this implies \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Consider using proof by contradiction or case analysis on P and Q\n\n4. Prove right to left direction:\n   - Assume \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Show that this implies \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use the definition of implication and logical negation\n\n5. Possible proof techniques to consider:\n   - Case analysis\n   - Contradiction\n   - Truth tables (for intuition, not formal proof)\n   - Use of basic logical rules and definitions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the negation of an implication\n   - Ensuring all cases are covered in the proof\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review each step to ensure logical consistency\n   - Check that both directions of the iff are properly addressed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe need to restructure the proof to avoid using the undefined \"iff\" rule. Instead, we should use a more basic proof structure that relies only on core Isabelle tactics. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start the proof with a simple \"proof\" command without specifying any rule.\n\n2. Use \"show ?thesis\" to state our goal, which is to prove the bi-implication.\n\n3. For a bi-implication, we need to prove both directions. We can do this by using nested proofs with \"show\" statements for each direction.\n\n4. For the left-to-right direction:\n   - Assume the left side: \"¬(P → Q)\"\n   - Use classical reasoning to prove \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Maintain the existing logical structure but adjust the syntax\n\n5. For the right-to-left direction:\n   - Assume the right side: \"P ∧ ¬Q\"\n   - Prove \"¬(P → Q)\" using contradiction\n   - Again, keep the logical structure but adjust the syntax\n\n6. Use basic tactics like \"assume\", \"have\", and \"show\" to construct the proof\n\n7. For simple logical steps, use the \"by\" keyword with appropriate methods like \"simp\" or \"contradiction\"\n\nThis approach should allow us to construct a valid proof using only core Isabelle functionality, avoiding the issue with the undefined \"iff\" rule.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the final \"qed\" command is failing to close the proof, indicating that some goals may be unresolved or not properly connected.\n\nImprovement: We should review each step of the proof, ensuring that all subgoals are properly closed and that the logical flow is complete, possibly adding intermediate steps or explicit connections between assumptions and conclusions.\n```\n\nBased on the current observation, it appears that while the overall structure of the proof is correct, there's an issue with finalizing the proof. The error message \"Failed to refine any pending goal\" suggests that Isabelle is unable to automatically close the proof at the final \"qed\" command. This could be due to some disconnected logical steps or unresolved subgoals.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Review each step of the proof carefully, ensuring that all assumptions are used and all necessary conclusions are explicitly stated.\n\n2. Consider adding intermediate steps to make the logical flow more explicit and easier for Isabelle to follow.\n\n3. Use the \"show\" command more explicitly to connect our conclusions to the thesis at each level of the proof.\n\n4. Ensure that each nested proof is properly closed before moving to the next level.\n\n5. Use Isabelle's proof state viewer (if available) to identify any remaining subgoals that aren't being addressed.\n\n6. Consider using more basic tactics or breaking down complex steps into smaller, more explicit steps that Isabelle can more easily verify.\n\n7. If necessary, use the \"oops\" command temporarily at different points in the proof to identify where exactly Isabelle is losing track of the proof state.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to create a more robust and complete proof that Isabelle can successfully verify and close.",
