    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof for the lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\", the most logical first step is to apply induction on n as suggested in the planning strategy. This is because:\n\n1. The lemma statement involves a variable n of type mynat, which is defined recursively.\n2. The myadd function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n3. Induction is a powerful technique for proving properties of recursively defined datatypes and functions.\n\nApplying induction will generate two subgoals:\n- Base case: myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n- Inductive step: Assuming myadd n MyZero = n, prove myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n\nThis aligns perfectly with our datatype definition and will allow us to leverage the recursive structure of both mynat and myadd in our proof.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n using the command:\napply (induction n)\n\nThis will set up the proof structure for both the base case and the inductive step, allowing us to tackle each part separately in subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error message indicates a database-related issue rather than a problem with the proof itself, suggesting an environment or system-level problem.\n\nImprovement: We need to verify the Isabelle environment setup and file permissions, ensuring the database is writable and properly configured before proceeding with the proof.\n```\n\nThe current outcome is unsatisfactory not due to the proof strategy or its implementation, but because of an underlying system issue. The error messages indicate problems with the Isabelle database, specifically that it's in a read-only state or has been moved.\n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. Check the Isabelle installation and ensure all components are correctly set up.\n2. Verify file permissions for the Isabelle database, making sure the system has write access.\n3. If using a version control system, ensure that the database files are not being inadvertently moved or modified during operations.\n4. Consider restarting the Isabelle environment or, if necessary, reinstalling Isabelle to resolve any potential corruption issues.\n\nOnce the environment issues are resolved, we can proceed with the proof as planned. The induction strategy proposed is sound and should be effective for proving the lemma. After fixing the system issues, we should be able to apply the induction and move forward with the proof steps as originally intended.\n\nFor the next attempt:\n1. Confirm that the Isabelle environment is stable and the database is accessible and writable.\n2. Reapply the induction step: apply (induction n)\n3. Proceed with proving the base case and inductive step as planned in the original strategy.\n\nBy addressing these system-level issues, we can ensure that future actions align with our goal of successfully proving the theorem without being hindered by environmental constraints.",
