    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the environmental issues encountered, our primary focus should be on resolving these system-level problems before proceeding with the actual proof. However, assuming these issues have been addressed, we can proceed with our original proving strategy. The induction step has already been applied, which is correct according to our plan.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. The induction on 'n' has generated two subgoals: the base case and the inductive step.\n\n2. For the base case, we need to prove: myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\n   This should follow directly from the definition of myadd.\n\n3. For the inductive step, we need to prove: \n   Assuming myadd n MyZero = n, show that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   This will involve using the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis.\n\n4. Both of these cases can likely be solved using simplification, which aligns with step 6 of our original plan.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step would be to apply the 'auto' tactic, which combines simplification with other basic proof methods. This should be sufficient to prove both the base case and the inductive step, completing our proof.\n\nSuggested next action for the acting agent: Apply the 'auto' tactic to solve both subgoals simultaneously.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type definition of the 'myadd' function, specifically with the arrow symbols used.\n\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbols (⇒) with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol (\\<Rightarrow>) in the type signature of the 'myadd' function to resolve the parsing error.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue is not with the proof strategy itself, but with the syntax used in defining the function. The non-standard arrow symbols are causing a lexical error that prevents Isabelle from parsing the theory file correctly. \n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. The acting agent should modify the 'myadd' function definition, replacing \"mynat ⇒ mynat ⇒ mynat\" with \"mynat \\<Rightarrow> mynat \\<Rightarrow> mynat\".\n\n2. After correcting this syntax error, we can proceed with the original proof strategy, which appears to be correct.\n\n3. The induction and auto steps that were attempted should be sufficient to prove the lemma once the parsing error is resolved.\n\n4. We should pay closer attention to syntax and symbol usage in future steps to avoid similar parsing errors.\n\n5. Once the syntax is corrected, we can expect the proof to proceed smoothly with the existing steps (induction followed by auto).\n\nThis reflection emphasizes the importance of correct syntax in formal proofs and suggests a clear, actionable step to resolve the current issue and move forward with the proof.",
