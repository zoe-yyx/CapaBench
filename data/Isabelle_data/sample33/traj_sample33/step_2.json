    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a syntax error in the function definition, not a problem with the proof strategy itself. To proceed with the proof, we need to correct the syntax first. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Modify the 'myadd' function definition:\n   Replace the non-standard arrow symbols (â‡’) with the correct Isabelle arrow symbol (\\<Rightarrow>). The corrected function definition should look like this:\n\n   fun myadd :: \"mynat \\<Rightarrow> mynat \\<Rightarrow> mynat\" where\n     \"myadd MyZero m = m\" |\n     \"myadd (MySuc n) m = MySuc (myadd n m)\"\n\n2. After correcting the syntax, the original proof strategy should work. The existing proof script:\n\n   lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n   apply (induction n)\n   auto\n   done\n\n   This proof script is correct and should be sufficient to prove the lemma once the syntax error is resolved.\n\n3. The reasoning behind this proof:\n   - We use induction on 'n' because the 'myadd' function is defined recursively.\n   - The base case (n = MyZero) is trivial and should be solved automatically.\n   - The inductive step uses the induction hypothesis and the definition of 'myadd' for the successor case.\n   - The 'auto' tactic should be able to handle both cases automatically by simplifying the definitions and applying the induction hypothesis.\n\n4. If the 'auto' tactic doesn't completely solve the proof after fixing the syntax, we may need to break down the proof into more explicit steps. However, given the simplicity of the lemma, 'auto' should be sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on correcting the syntax error in the function definition. Once that's done, rerun the existing proof script, which should complete the proof successfully.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof script is using the 'auto' tactic without proper syntax, leading to an outer syntax error.\n\nImprovement: Modify the proof script to use proper Isabelle syntax for applying tactics, such as 'by auto' instead of just 'auto'.\n```\n\nThe current error indicates that there's a syntax issue in the proof script, specifically with the use of the 'auto' tactic. In Isabelle, tactics are typically applied using specific command structures.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The proof script should be modified to use proper Isabelle syntax. Instead of:\n\n   apply (induction n)\n   auto\n   done\n\n   It should be:\n\n   apply (induction n)\n   by auto\n\n   Or alternatively:\n\n   by (induction n, auto)\n\n2. The acting agent should focus on correcting this syntax in the proof script.\n\n3. After making this change, the proof should be attempted again. The correct syntax should allow Isabelle to process the proof properly.\n\n4. If the proof still doesn't go through after this correction, we may need to consider a more detailed, step-by-step proof approach. However, given the simplicity of the lemma, this corrected syntax should be sufficient.\n\n5. It's important to note that the 'sorry' keyword was not used in this proof attempt, which is good. We should continue to avoid using 'sorry' and aim for a complete, rigorous proof.\n\nBy addressing this syntax issue, we should be able to make progress on proving the lemma. The overall strategy of using induction and automation is correct for this type of problem, so once the syntax is fixed, we have a good chance of completing the proof successfully.",
