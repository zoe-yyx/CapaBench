    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a lexical error due to the use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒) in the function type definition. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we should:\n\n1. Replace all instances of the Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with its ASCII equivalent (=>) in the theory file. This includes the function type definition for myadd and any other occurrences.\n\n2. After making this change, we should attempt to reload the theory file in Isabelle to ensure it parses correctly without any lexical errors.\n\n3. Assuming the parsing issue is resolved, we can then proceed with the original proof strategy:\n   - The lemma statement \"add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\" should remain unchanged.\n   - The proof by induction using the 'auto' method (\"by (induction n) auto\") should be sufficient to prove the lemma.\n\n4. If the proof doesn't go through automatically after fixing the parsing issue, we may need to break down the proof steps more explicitly:\n   - Start with \"proof (induction n)\"\n   - Handle the base case and inductive step separately, using \"case\" commands.\n   - Use \"simp\" or other appropriate tactics to simplify and solve each case.\n\n5. Once the proof is complete, verify that the lemma is added to the theory's context without any remaining errors or warnings.\n\nThis approach addresses the immediate syntactic issue while maintaining the original proof strategy, which is sound for this type of inductive proof on natural numbers.\n",
