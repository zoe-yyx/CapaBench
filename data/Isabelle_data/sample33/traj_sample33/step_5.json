    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. System Configuration Issue:\n   The error message indicates a fundamental problem with the Isabelle environment or system configuration, not with the proof itself. Before we can proceed with the proof, we need to resolve this underlying issue.\n\n2. Troubleshooting Steps:\n   a. Verify Isabelle Installation:\n      - Ensure Isabelle is correctly installed and all components are present.\n      - Check if the installation path is correct and accessible.\n\n   b. Check System Requirements:\n      - Confirm that the system meets all the prerequisites for running Isabelle.\n      - Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date.\n\n   c. Environment Variables:\n      - Check if all required environment variables are set correctly.\n      - Ensure PATH includes the directory containing the Isabelle executable.\n\n   d. Permissions:\n      - Verify that the user has the necessary permissions to run Isabelle and access its files.\n\n   e. Version Compatibility:\n      - Confirm that the version of Isabelle being used is compatible with the operating system.\n\n3. Next Actions:\n   a. Attempt to run a simple Isabelle command or open the Isabelle IDE to isolate the issue.\n   b. If the problem persists, consider reinstalling Isabelle or updating to the latest stable version.\n   c. Consult Isabelle documentation or community forums for specific troubleshooting steps related to this error.\n\n4. Proof Strategy (Once System Issues are Resolved):\n   Once the environment is properly set up and Isabelle can initialize successfully, we can return to the proof attempt. The previous approach using induction appears structurally correct:\n   \n   lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n     by (induction n) auto\n\n   This proof strategy should work once the system issues are resolved.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error indicates a database constraint issue within Isabelle's internal system, preventing the theory from being processed.\n\nImprovement: We need to focus on resolving the database constraint issue, possibly by clearing Isabelle's cache or ensuring no conflicting session names exist, before attempting to prove the theorem.\n```\n\nThe current situation reveals a fundamental issue with Isabelle's internal database rather than a problem with our proof strategy. This SQLite constraint error suggests that there might be a conflict in the session information storage, possibly due to a duplicate session name or corrupted database.\n\nTo move forward effectively, we should:\n\n1. Clear Isabelle's cache: This can often resolve issues related to session information conflicts. Look for a cache directory in Isabelle's user data folder and clear its contents.\n\n2. Check for conflicting theory names: Ensure that there are no other theories with the same name (Add0R) in the current working directory or in Isabelle's search path.\n\n3. Restart Isabelle: A fresh start of the Isabelle environment might help clear any temporary issues.\n\n4. Verify theory file integrity: Double-check that the theory file is correctly formatted and doesn't contain any hidden characters or encoding issues.\n\n5. Consider renaming the theory: If the issue persists, try renaming the theory to a unique name to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nOnce these system-level issues are resolved, we can return to the proof itself. The current proof strategy using induction appears correct and should work once Isabelle can properly process the theory file.\n\nFor the next steps, the planning and reasoning agents should focus on:\n1. Implementing the suggested troubleshooting steps to resolve the database constraint issue.\n2. Once resolved, verify that Isabelle can load and process the theory file without errors.\n3. If successful, proceed with the existing proof strategy, which should be sufficient to prove the lemma.\n4. If issues persist, consider breaking down the proof into smaller steps or using more explicit proof commands to identify any potential logical issues that might be obscured by the current system error.",
