    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt has a syntax error in the application of the 'auto' tactic. To correct this and proceed with the proof:\n\n1. Modify the proof script to use proper Isabelle syntax for applying tactics.\n\n2. The induction step is correct, so we should keep it.\n\n3. Combine the induction and auto steps into a single command using the 'by' keyword.\n\n4. The simplified proof script should look like this:\n\n   lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n   by (induction n, auto)\n\n5. This concise proof attempt uses structural induction on 'n' and then applies the 'auto' tactic to handle both the base case and inductive step automatically.\n\n6. The 'auto' tactic should be sufficient to prove this lemma given the definitions of 'myadd' and 'mynat'.\n\n7. If this doesn't work, we may need to expand the proof to handle the base case and inductive step separately, but let's try this simplified version first.\n\nBy making these changes, we address the syntax error and maintain the correct proving strategy using induction and automation, which is appropriate for this type of recursive definition and lemma.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof script is correct, but there's a lexical error in the type declaration of the 'myadd' function, specifically with the arrow symbols used.\nImprovement: Replace the unicode arrow symbols (⇒) in the 'myadd' function type declaration with the ASCII representation (=>), and ensure all special characters are properly encoded or replaced throughout the theory file.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt for the lemma 'add_0_r' is actually correct and concise. The issue lies not in the proof itself, but in the earlier definition of the 'myadd' function. Isabelle is failing to parse the type declaration due to the use of unicode arrow symbols (⇒) instead of the ASCII representation (=>).\n\nTo improve the outcome in the next steps:\n\n1. Review and correct all instances of special characters or unicode symbols in the theory file, particularly in type declarations and function definitions.\n\n2. Specifically, modify the 'myadd' function declaration to use ASCII symbols:\n   ```\n   fun myadd :: \"mynat => mynat => mynat\" where\n   ```\n\n3. Double-check other parts of the theory file for similar issues, such as the datatype declaration for 'mynat'.\n\n4. After correcting these syntax issues, the current proof attempt for 'add_0_r' should work as intended.\n\n5. If there are still issues after fixing the syntax, consider expanding the proof to handle the base case and inductive step separately for more detailed control and debugging.\n\nBy addressing these fundamental syntax issues, we can ensure that Isabelle can properly parse and process the entire theory file, allowing the proof attempt to proceed as intended.",
