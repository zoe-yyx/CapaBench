    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and the reflection provided, here's my reasoning to guide the next proving operation:\n\n1. The primary issue is not with the proof itself, but with the syntax in the function definition. We need to address this before proceeding with the proof.\n\n2. The 'myadd' function definition should be modified to use ASCII arrows (=>) instead of unicode arrows (â‡’). This change is crucial for Isabelle to properly parse the type declaration.\n\n3. After correcting the syntax, the current proof attempt using induction and auto should be sufficient to prove the lemma. The concise proof \"by (induction n) auto\" is appropriate for this simple lemma.\n\n4. If the syntax correction doesn't resolve all issues, we may need to expand the proof to handle the base case and inductive step separately. This would involve using the 'proof' command followed by explicit handling of each case.\n\n5. It's also advisable to review the entire theory file for any other instances of unicode symbols that might cause parsing issues, particularly in the datatype declaration for 'mynat'.\n\n6. Once the syntax issues are resolved, we can retry the proof as it is currently written. If successful, no further changes to the proof itself will be necessary.\n\n7. If any unexpected issues arise after fixing the syntax, we should consider breaking down the proof into more explicit steps for better control and debugging.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on correcting the syntax in the function definition as the next immediate step. This should allow the proof to proceed without further modifications.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a system-level issue rather than a problem with the theorem or proof structure.\n\nImprovement: We need to investigate and resolve the underlying system or environment problem that is preventing Isabelle from initializing properly before attempting to prove the theorem.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the current issue is not related to the proof itself or the theorem structure, but rather to a fundamental problem with the Isabelle environment or system configuration. The error message indicates that the session startup failed, suggesting a more severe problem than just syntax or proof logic.\n\nTo address this:\n\n1. We should first ensure that Isabelle is correctly installed and configured on the system.\n2. Check if there are any compatibility issues between the version of Isabelle being used and the system it's running on.\n3. Verify that all necessary dependencies for Isabelle are installed and up-to-date.\n4. Examine any recent changes to the system or Isabelle configuration that might have caused this issue.\n5. Consider reinstalling Isabelle or updating to the latest stable version if the problem persists.\n6. If possible, try running Isabelle on a different machine or in a different environment to isolate whether the issue is specific to the current setup.\n\nThe next steps should focus on resolving this system-level issue before attempting to prove the theorem again. Once the environment is properly set up and Isabelle can initialize successfully, we can return to the proof attempt, which seems structurally correct based on the previous actions.",
