    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\n\n1. Recognize the Problem Structure:\n   - We're dealing with a custom natural number datatype (mynat) and a custom addition function (myadd).\n   - The goal is to prove that adding MyZero to the right of any mynat number results in the same number.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Technique:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the mynat datatype and myadd function, structural induction on n is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the command \"lemma add_0_r: \"myadd n MyZero = n\"\"\n   b. Apply induction on n: \"by (induction n)\"\n   c. This will generate two subgoals: base case and inductive step\n\n4. Handle the Base Case:\n   - Show that \"myadd MyZero MyZero = MyZero\"\n   - This should follow directly from the definition of myadd\n\n5. Handle the Inductive Step:\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis: myadd n MyZero = n\n   - Prove that myadd (MySuc n) MyZero = MySuc n\n   - Use the definition of myadd and the inductive hypothesis\n\n6. Complete the Proof:\n   - The induction proof should automatically handle both cases\n   - If needed, use simplification (\"simp\") or other basic tactics to finish the proof\n\n7. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are discharged\n   - Check that the theorem is added to the theory's context\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the add_0_r lemma using induction, which aligns well with the recursive definitions of mynat and myadd.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and the reflection provided, our reasoning should focus on resolving the database constraint issue before proceeding with the proof. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. System-level Resolution:\n   - The primary focus should be on resolving the SQLite constraint error.\n   - Clear Isabelle's cache to remove any conflicting session information.\n   - Ensure no other theories with the name \"Add0R\" exist in the working directory or Isabelle's search path.\n   - Restart the Isabelle environment to clear any temporary issues.\n\n2. Theory File Verification:\n   - Double-check the theory file for correct formatting and encoding.\n   - Consider renaming the theory to a unique name (e.g., \"Add0R_Unique\") to avoid potential conflicts.\n\n3. Proof Strategy (once system issues are resolved):\n   - The current proof strategy using induction appears correct.\n   - The proof \"by (induction n) auto\" should be sufficient once Isabelle can process the file.\n\n4. Fallback Approach:\n   - If system-level resolution doesn't work, consider breaking down the proof into explicit steps:\n     a. Apply induction: \"apply (induction n)\"\n     b. Handle base case: \"apply simp\"\n     c. Handle inductive step: \"apply simp\"\n     d. Complete proof: \"done\"\n\n5. Verification:\n   - After implementing changes, verify that Isabelle can load and process the theory file without errors.\n   - Ensure the lemma is successfully proved and added to the theory's context.\n\nThis reasoning guides the acting agent to first address the system-level issue, then verify the theory file, and finally proceed with the proof, providing alternative steps if needed.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The error indicates a lexical issue with the Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) used in the function type definition, suggesting potential encoding or character set problems.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) in the function type definition to ensure compatibility and correct parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the use of Unicode symbols that Isabelle is failing to parse correctly. The improvement suggests a practical solution by using ASCII equivalents, which are more widely supported and less likely to cause encoding issues.\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The lexical error on line 7 specifically points to the function type definition using Unicode arrows (⇒). This suggests that Isabelle is having trouble interpreting these characters correctly.\n\n2. Encoding issues can arise when working with different text editors or operating systems, leading to inconsistencies in how special characters are interpreted.\n\n3. By replacing the Unicode arrows with their ASCII equivalents (=>), we can eliminate this potential source of error while maintaining the semantic meaning of the code.\n\n4. This change should be applied consistently throughout the theory file to ensure all type definitions and other occurrences of the arrow symbol are using the ASCII version.\n\n5. After making this change, it's important to verify that the entire file can be parsed without errors, as this was the initial roadblock preventing the proof from being processed.\n\n6. Once the parsing issue is resolved, the proof strategy using induction and auto should be able to proceed as intended.\n\n7. For future theory development, it may be beneficial to establish a consistent convention for symbol usage (either sticking to ASCII or ensuring proper Unicode support) to avoid similar issues.\n\nThis reflection provides a clear, actionable step to address the immediate issue while also offering insight into potential best practices for future theory development in Isabelle.",
