    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a universal quantification over predicates P and Q.\n   - The goal is to prove: P → (¬P) → Q\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'allI' rule to introduce universal quantifiers for P and Q.\n   - Apply the 'impI' rule twice to break down the implication chain.\n   - Identify the contradiction in the assumptions (P and ¬P).\n   - Use the contradiction to prove Q (principle of explosion).\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with 'proof' command to begin the proof.\n   b. Use 'fix P Q' to introduce arbitrary P and Q.\n   c. Use 'show' to state the goal to be proved.\n   d. Apply 'proof' again to start proving the implication.\n   e. Assume P and ¬P as premises.\n   f. Use the contradiction to prove Q.\n   g. Close the proof with 'qed'.\n\n4. Consider potential proof techniques:\n   - Classical reasoning might be useful (principle of explosion).\n   - The 'contradiction' or 'blast' methods could be effective for handling the contradiction.\n\n5. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of quantifiers and implications.\n   - Be ready to justify the step where Q is derived from the contradiction.\n\n6. Plan for verification:\n   - After completing the proof, use 'sledgehammer' to check for simpler proofs.\n   - Consider using 'try' or 'try0' to explore alternative proof methods.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned approach:\n\n1. Begin the proof using the 'proof' command to enter the proof environment.\n\n2. Use 'fix P Q' to introduce arbitrary predicates P and Q. This aligns with the universal quantification in the theorem statement.\n\n3. State the goal using 'show' command. This will explicitly set up what we need to prove.\n\n4. Start proving the implication chain by using 'proof' again.\n\n5. For the first implication, we should assume P as a premise using 'assume'.\n\nThe reasoning behind this approach is to set up the proof structure that matches the theorem's form. By fixing P and Q, we're working with arbitrary predicates, which is necessary for proving a universally quantified statement. Starting with the outermost implication and assuming P allows us to work inwards, following the structure of the theorem.\n\nThis approach sets a solid foundation for the subsequent steps where we'll handle the nested implication and eventually use the contradiction between P and ¬P to prove Q.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but there's a technical issue with the Isabelle environment preventing successful execution.\n\nImprovement: We need to address the database access issue before proceeding with the proof, possibly by ensuring write permissions or relocating the database file.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and approach are logically sound and aligned with the theorem we're trying to prove. The steps taken so far correctly set up the proof environment, introduce the necessary variables, and begin to construct the logical flow of the proof.\n\nHowever, the execution is being hindered by a technical issue related to the Isabelle environment. Specifically, there seems to be a problem with the database file used by Isabelle. The error messages indicate that the database is read-only or has been moved, preventing the system from writing necessary information.\n\nTo move forward effectively:\n\n1. We should first address this technical issue. This may involve:\n   - Checking and adjusting file permissions for the Isabelle database.\n   - Ensuring the database file hasn't been moved or is in the expected location.\n   - Potentially reinstalling or reconfiguring the Isabelle environment if the issue persists.\n\n2. Once the technical issue is resolved, we can proceed with the proof as planned. The current structure is correct, so we can continue from where we left off.\n\n3. The next step in the proof would be to use the contradiction between P and ¬P to prove Q. This can typically be done using the 'contradiction' tactic or by explicitly showing that we have both P and ¬P, which implies anything (including Q).\n\n4. After proving Q, we should be able to close all the proof blocks and complete the lemma.\n\nBy addressing the technical issue and then following through with the logical steps of the proof, we should be able to successfully prove the theorem in the next iteration.",
