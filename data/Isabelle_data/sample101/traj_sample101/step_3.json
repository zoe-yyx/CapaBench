    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a universal quantification over predicates P and Q.\n   - The goal is to prove: P → (¬P) → Q\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'allI' rule to introduce universal quantifiers for P and Q.\n   - Apply the 'impI' rule twice to break down the implication chain.\n   - Identify the contradiction in the assumptions (P and ¬P).\n   - Use the contradiction to prove Q (principle of explosion).\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with 'proof' command to begin the proof.\n   b. Use 'fix P Q' to introduce arbitrary P and Q.\n   c. Use 'show' to state the goal to be proved.\n   d. Apply 'proof' again to start proving the implication.\n   e. Assume P and ¬P as premises.\n   f. Use the contradiction to prove Q.\n   g. Close the proof with 'qed'.\n\n4. Consider potential proof techniques:\n   - Classical reasoning might be useful (principle of explosion).\n   - The 'contradiction' or 'blast' methods could be effective for handling the contradiction.\n\n5. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of quantifiers and implications.\n   - Be ready to justify the step where Q is derived from the contradiction.\n\n6. Plan for verification:\n   - After completing the proof, use 'sledgehammer' to check for simpler proofs.\n   - Consider using 'try' or 'try0' to explore alternative proof methods.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Technical Issue Resolution:\n   The primary focus should be on resolving the technical issue with the Isabelle environment. The proof structure appears logically sound, but Isabelle is failing to process it correctly.\n\n2. Proof Preservation:\n   The current proof structure should be maintained as it follows the planned approach correctly. Once the technical issues are resolved, this proof should work as intended.\n\n3. Step-by-Step Verification:\n   If the technical issues persist, consider breaking down the proof into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help isolate where exactly the system is struggling to process the proof.\n\n4. Alternative Tactics:\n   While the current approach is logically correct, if system limitations continue, explore using alternative tactics that might be less demanding on the Isabelle environment. For instance, try using 'auto' or 'blast' instead of explicit proof steps.\n\n5. Sledgehammer Utilization:\n   Once the environment is stable, use the 'sledgehammer' tool to verify if there are more efficient or system-friendly proof methods available for this theorem.\n\n6. Documentation:\n   Maintain a detailed log of all actions taken, both in terms of proof attempts and system troubleshooting. This will be valuable for identifying patterns or seeking external help if needed.\n\n7. Environment Check:\n   Before proceeding with further proof attempts, verify that all necessary components of Isabelle are correctly installed, configured, and have the proper permissions.\n\nThe acting agent should prioritize resolving the technical issues with the Isabelle environment before making significant changes to the proof itself. The current proof structure is logically sound and should work once the environment is functioning properly.\n",
