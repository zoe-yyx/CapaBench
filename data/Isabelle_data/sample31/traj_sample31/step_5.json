    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem square_5: \"square 5 = 25\"\n   - We have a definition of the square function for integers\n\n2. Analyze the definition:\n   - The square function is defined as square x = x * x\n   - This means we need to show that 5 * 5 = 25\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Unfold the definition of square\n   b. Simplify the expression 5 * 5\n   c. Show that the result equals 25\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start with the left-hand side of the equation\n   - Apply the definition of square\n   - Perform integer multiplication\n   - Conclude that the result is equal to 25\n\n5. Consider potential proof methods:\n   - Use simp (simplification) to unfold the definition and perform calculations\n   - If simp doesn't work automatically, consider using the following steps:\n     * unfold square_def\n     * auto\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to break it down into smaller steps if needed\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all steps are logical and complete\n   - Check that no additional assumptions were introduced during the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is due to a syntax issue in the type definition of the 'square' function. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we should:\n\n1. Modify the type definition to use the ASCII representation of the arrow (=>) instead of the Unicode symbol (â‡’).\n\n2. Keep the rest of the definition and the lemma statement unchanged, as they appear to be correct.\n\n3. Once the syntax error is resolved, we can proceed with the proof as originally planned, which involves:\n   a. Unfolding the definition of square\n   b. Simplifying the expression 5 * 5\n   c. Showing that the result equals 25\n\n4. The proof structure using 'proof -', 'have', and 'thus' statements is correct and should work once the definition is fixed.\n\n5. The use of 'simp add: square_def' and 'by simp' in the proof steps is appropriate for this straightforward calculation.\n\nThe next step should be to correct the type definition and then attempt to run the proof again. If successful, we can then focus on verifying the completeness and correctness of the proof steps.\n",
