    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem square_5: \"square 5 = 25\", and considering our planning strategy, the most logical first step is to unfold the definition of the square function. This will allow us to work directly with the expression 5 * 5, which we can then simplify to 25.\n\nThe definition of square is provided in the problem description, so we know that square x = x * x. Applying this to our specific case where x = 5 will give us the expression we need to prove.\n\nTherefore, I recommend starting with unfolding the definition of square. This can typically be done using the 'unfold' command followed by the name of the definition, which in this case is 'square_def'.\n\nAfter unfolding the definition, the proof state should show something like \"5 * 5 = 25\", which can then be easily simplified or calculated to complete the proof.\n\nIf the unfolding and simplification don't happen automatically, we may need to guide the prover through these steps explicitly.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was correct, but the error message indicates a database-related issue rather than a problem with the proof itself.\nImprovement: We should verify the Isabelle environment setup and database integrity, then retry the proof as it appears to be correct logically.\n```\n\nThe proof strategy and implementation appear to be correct. The proof unfolds the definition of 'square', applies it to 5, and then simplifies the result to 25. This is exactly what we wanted to achieve.\n\nHowever, the error message we received is not related to the proof itself. It's a SQLite database error, specifically a primary key constraint violation. This suggests there might be an issue with the Isabelle environment or its associated database.\n\nFor the next steps, I recommend:\n\n1. Checking the Isabelle installation and environment setup to ensure everything is correctly configured.\n2. Verifying the integrity of the Isabelle database.\n3. If possible, trying to run the proof in a fresh Isabelle session or even reinstalling Isabelle if the issue persists.\n4. Once the environment issues are resolved, retrying the exact same proof as it is logically correct.\n\nThe proof itself doesn't need modification. The focus should be on resolving the technical issue preventing the proof from being processed correctly by Isabelle.",
