    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem square_5: \"square 5 = 25\"\n   - We have a definition of the square function for integers\n\n2. Analyze the definition:\n   - The square function is defined as square x = x * x\n   - This means we need to show that 5 * 5 = 25\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Unfold the definition of square\n   b. Simplify the expression 5 * 5\n   c. Show that the result equals 25\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start with the left-hand side of the equation\n   - Apply the definition of square\n   - Perform integer multiplication\n   - Conclude that the result is equal to 25\n\n5. Consider potential proof methods:\n   - Use simp (simplification) to unfold the definition and perform calculations\n   - If simp doesn't work automatically, consider using the following steps:\n     * unfold square_def\n     * auto\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to break it down into smaller steps if needed\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all steps are logical and complete\n   - Check that no additional assumptions were introduced during the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. The proof structure and logic are correct. The issue lies with the Isabelle environment, specifically a database constraint error.\n\n2. The acting agent should focus on resolving the Isabelle environment issue rather than modifying the proof. This may involve:\n   a. Restarting the Isabelle IDE\n   b. Clearing any caches or temporary files\n   c. Recreating the session database\n   d. Checking for and applying any Isabelle updates\n\n3. Once the environment issue is resolved, the existing proof should be re-run as is. The proof correctly:\n   - Unfolds the definition of 'square'\n   - Applies it to 5\n   - Simplifies the result to 25\n\n4. If the environment issue persists after basic troubleshooting, consider more drastic measures like reinstalling Isabelle.\n\n5. After resolving the technical issues, if the proof passes successfully, consider expanding the theory by:\n   - Adding more test cases for the 'square' function\n   - Proving additional properties of the 'square' function\n\n6. Throughout this process, carefully observe any new error messages that may appear, as they could reveal previously hidden issues in the proof or theory structure.\n\nThe key is to maintain the correct proof while addressing the technical obstacles preventing its successful execution. This approach ensures progress towards proving the theorem while also maintaining a stable working environment.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is correct, but there are technical issues with the Isabelle environment, specifically a database constraint error preventing successful execution.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the Isabelle environment issue by restarting the IDE, clearing caches, recreating the session database, or updating Isabelle, before re-running the existing correct proof.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core problem is not with the proof itself, but with the Isabelle environment. The flaw identifies the specific technical issue causing the failure, while the improvement suggests concrete steps to resolve this issue.\n\nThe acting agent should prioritize addressing these technical obstacles rather than modifying the proof. Once the environment is stable, the existing proof should be sufficient to prove the theorem. If issues persist after basic troubleshooting, more drastic measures like reinstalling Isabelle may be necessary.\n\nIt's important to note that the error message also indicates a parsing issue with the type definition. This could be due to encoding problems or incompatible character sets. When resolving the environment issues, special attention should be paid to ensuring proper encoding and character set compatibility.\n\nAfter resolving these technical issues, if the proof passes successfully, the team can consider expanding the theory with additional test cases or properties of the 'square' function to further strengthen the overall proof and understanding of the concept.",
