    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem square_5: \"square 5 = 25\"\n   - We have a definition of the square function for integers\n\n2. Analyze the definition:\n   - The square function is defined as square x = x * x\n   - This means we need to show that 5 * 5 = 25\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Unfold the definition of square\n   b. Simplify the expression 5 * 5\n   c. Show that the result equals 25\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start with the left-hand side of the equation\n   - Apply the definition of square\n   - Perform integer multiplication\n   - Conclude that the result is equal to 25\n\n5. Consider potential proof methods:\n   - Use simp (simplification) to unfold the definition and perform calculations\n   - If simp doesn't work automatically, consider using the following steps:\n     * unfold square_def\n     * auto\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to break it down into smaller steps if needed\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all steps are logical and complete\n   - Check that no additional assumptions were introduced during the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Environment Issue: The primary obstacle is a technical problem with the Isabelle environment, not the proof itself. The error messages indicate both a database issue and a parsing problem.\n\n2. Database Error: The \"[SQLITE_READONLY_DBMOVED]\" error suggests that the Isabelle database file has been moved or is inaccessible. This needs to be addressed before any proof can be executed.\n\n3. Parsing Error: There's also a lexical error at line 5, specifically with \"⇒ int\". This could be due to encoding issues or incompatible character sets.\n\n4. Proof Validity: The existing proof structure appears correct and should work once the environment issues are resolved.\n\n5. Next Steps:\n   a. Restart the Isabelle IDE to see if it resolves the database issue.\n   b. If the restart doesn't work, try clearing Isabelle caches and recreating the session database.\n   c. Check the encoding of the theory file to ensure it's using UTF-8 or another compatible encoding.\n   d. If issues persist, consider updating or reinstalling Isabelle.\n   e. Once the environment is stable, re-run the existing proof without changes.\n   f. If the proof passes after fixing the environment, consider adding more test cases or properties of the 'square' function to strengthen the theory.\n\n6. Caution: Do not modify the proof structure until the environment issues are resolved, as the current proof should be sufficient once executed in a stable environment.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation and past actions, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to technical issues with the Isabelle environment, specifically a database error and a parsing problem, rather than issues with the proof logic itself.\n\nImprovement: Address the environment issues by restarting Isabelle, checking file permissions, and ensuring correct character encoding, then re-run the existing proof without modifications.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the primary obstacle is not in the proof itself, but in the technical setup of the Isabelle environment. The database error suggesting a read-only or moved database file is a critical issue that needs to be resolved before any proof can be executed successfully. Additionally, the parsing error with the arrow symbol \"→\" (which appears as \"- >\" in the error message) indicates a potential encoding issue.\n\nTo move forward effectively:\n\n1. First, attempt to restart the Isabelle IDE to see if it resolves the database issue.\n2. If the restart doesn't work, check the permissions of the Isabelle database file and ensure it's in the correct location and writable.\n3. Verify that the theory file is saved with the correct encoding (UTF-8 is recommended) to resolve the parsing issue with the arrow symbol.\n4. If problems persist, consider clearing Isabelle caches or even reinstalling Isabelle as a last resort.\n\nOnce the environment issues are resolved, the existing proof structure should be sufficient to prove the lemma. The proof logic appears correct, using the definition of `square` and then simplifying. There's no need to modify the proof itself at this stage.\n\nAfter successfully running the proof in a stable environment, consider expanding the theory with additional lemmas or properties of the `square` function to strengthen the overall theory. However, this should only be done after confirming that the current lemma can be proved without issues in the corrected environment.",
