Analyze the definition:\n   - The square function is defined as square x = x * x\n   - This means we need to show that 5 * 5 = 25\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Unfold the definition of square\n   b. Simplify the expression 5 * 5\n   c. Show that the result equals 25\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start with the left-hand side of the equation\n   - Apply the definition of square\n   - Perform integer multiplication\n   - Conclude that the result is equal to 25\n\n5. Consider potential proof methods:\n   - Use simp (simplification) to unfold the definition and perform calculations\n   - If simp doesn't work automatically, consider using the following steps:\n     * unfold square_def\n     * auto\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to break it down into smaller steps if needed\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all steps are logical and complete\n   - Check that no additional assumptions were introduced during the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is not with the proof logic itself, but with the Isabelle environment. The error messages indicate two main problems:\n\n1. A syntax error in the type definition of the square function.\n2. A database-related error suggesting issues with file permissions or database location.\n\nTo address these issues and proceed with the proof, I recommend the following reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to correct the syntax error in the square function definition. The error message suggests there's an issue with the arrow symbol. We should ensure that the definition is written as:\n\n   definition square :: \"int ⇒ int\" where\n   \"square x = x * x\"\n\n   Note the use of the correct arrow symbol (⇒) instead of the problematic \"- >\".\n\n2. For the database-related error, we should:\n   a. Restart the Isabelle IDE to see if it resolves the issue.\n   b. If the problem persists, check the permissions of the Isabelle database file and ensure it's in the correct location and writable.\n   c. As a last resort, consider clearing Isabelle caches or reinstalling Isabelle.\n\n3. Once the environment issues are resolved, we can proceed with the existing proof structure, which appears logically correct:\n\n   lemma square_5: \"square 5 = 25\"\n   proof -\n     have \"square 5 = 5 * 5\" by (simp add: square_def)\n     thus ?thesis by simp\n   qed\n\n   This proof unfolds the definition of square and then simplifies the arithmetic, which should be sufficient to prove the lemma.\n\n4. After successfully proving the lemma, we can consider expanding the theory with additional properties of the square function, but only after confirming that the current lemma can be proved without issues in the corrected environment.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The use of the Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) in the type definition is causing a lexical error, indicating that Isabelle is not correctly interpreting this symbol.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with the ASCII representation \"=>\" in the type definition to ensure compatibility and correct parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that while we correctly identified the need to use a proper arrow symbol in the type definition, we inadvertently introduced a new issue by using a Unicode symbol that Isabelle's parser is not correctly interpreting in this context. \n\nTo improve our approach in the next steps:\n\n1. We should modify the type definition to use the ASCII representation of the arrow:\n   ```\n   definition square :: \"int => int\" where\n   \"square x = x * x\"\n   ```\n\n2. We should be more cautious about using special characters and symbols, preferring ASCII representations when possible to avoid potential parsing issues.\n\n3. It's important to test each modification individually to isolate and address issues more effectively.\n\n4. We should also consider checking the Isabelle documentation or configuration to see if there's a way to enable support for Unicode symbols if they are preferred for readability.\n\n5. Once the type definition is corrected, we can proceed with the proof as previously outlined, which appears logically sound.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to resolve the current error and move forward with proving the lemma. This approach balances the need for correct syntax with the goal of creating a clear and provable theorem.",
