    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem square_5: \"square 5 = 25\"\n   - We have a definition of the square function for integers\n\n2. Analyze the definition:\n   - The square function is defined as square x = x * x\n   - This means we need to show that 5 * 5 = 25\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Unfold the definition of square\n   b. Simplify the expression 5 * 5\n   c. Show that the result equals 25\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start with the left-hand side of the equation\n   - Apply the definition of square\n   - Perform integer multiplication\n   - Conclude that the result is equal to 25\n\n5. Consider potential proof methods:\n   - Use simp (simplification) to unfold the definition and perform calculations\n   - If simp doesn't work automatically, consider using the following steps:\n     * unfold square_def\n     * auto\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to break it down into smaller steps if needed\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all steps are logical and complete\n   - Check that no additional assumptions were introduced during the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, my reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The proof structure and logic appear to be correct. The proof unfolds the definition of 'square', applies it to 5, and then simplifies the result to 25, which is exactly what we need to prove the theorem.\n\n2. The error message we're seeing is not related to the proof itself, but rather to a database issue in the Isabelle environment. This suggests that the problem lies in the system setup rather than in our proof.\n\n3. Given that the proof logic is sound, we don't need to modify the proof itself. Instead, we should focus on resolving the technical issue with the Isabelle environment.\n\n4. The specific error message (\"A PRIMARY KEY constraint failed\") indicates a problem with the Isabelle session database. This could be due to a corrupted database, conflicting session names, or an issue with the Isabelle installation.\n\n5. Before we can proceed with verifying the proof, we need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is functioning correctly.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following course of action for the acting agent:\n\n1. First, try to restart the Isabelle IDE to see if it resolves the database issue.\n2. If the problem persists, check the Isabelle installation and ensure all components are up to date.\n3. Consider clearing the Isabelle caches or recreating the session database if possible.\n4. If none of the above steps work, it may be necessary to reinstall Isabelle.\n5. Once the environment issues are resolved, retry the exact same proof as it is logically correct.\n\nThe focus should be on resolving the technical issue rather than modifying the proof itself. Once the environment is functioning correctly, we can proceed with verifying the proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is correct, but a database constraint error in Isabelle is preventing successful execution.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the Isabelle environment issue rather than modifying the proof, starting with restarting the IDE and potentially clearing caches or recreating the session database.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and logic are sound, correctly unfolding the definition of 'square', applying it to 5, and simplifying the result to 25. The error message indicates a problem with the Isabelle session database rather than with the proof itself.\n\nTo move forward, we should:\n\n1. Prioritize fixing the Isabelle environment issue. This could involve restarting the Isabelle IDE, checking for updates, clearing caches, or recreating the session database.\n\n2. If basic troubleshooting doesn't work, consider reinstalling Isabelle as a last resort.\n\n3. Once the environment is functioning correctly, rerun the exact same proof as it is logically correct.\n\n4. Pay attention to any new error messages that might appear after resolving the database issue, as they could reveal previously hidden problems in the proof or theory structure.\n\n5. If the proof passes after resolving the environment issue, consider adding more test cases or exploring related properties of the 'square' function to strengthen the overall theory.\n\nThe key is to maintain the correct proof while addressing the technical obstacles preventing its successful execution. This approach ensures we're making progress towards our goal of proving the theorem while also maintaining a stable working environment.",
