    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for logic_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the given assumptions:\n   - We have \"P1 ∧ Q1\" as a conjunction\n   - We have two implications: \"P1 ⇒ P2\" and \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\"\n   - Our goal is to prove \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n2. Break down the conjunction in the first assumption:\n   - Split \"P1 ∧ Q1\" into separate facts: P1 and Q1\n\n3. Use the split facts with the given implications:\n   - Apply \"P1 ⇒ P2\" to P1 to derive P2\n   - Apply \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\" to Q1 to derive Q2\n\n4. Combine the derived facts:\n   - Join P2 and Q2 to form the conjunction \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n5. Proof structure:\n   a. Start with 'proof -'\n   b. Use 'from' or 'using' to reference the assumptions\n   c. Apply 'have' statements to derive intermediate results\n   d. Use 'show' to demonstrate the final goal\n\n6. Possible tactics to consider:\n   - conjunction elimination (conjE) to split \"P1 ∧ Q1\"\n   - modus ponens (mp) or implication elimination (impE) for the implications\n   - conjunction introduction (conjI) to form the final \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n7. Finish the proof with 'qed'\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem logic_ex2 by leveraging the given assumptions and applying logical reasoning to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe immediate priority is to address the lexical error by replacing the Unicode logical symbols with their ASCII equivalents. This will allow Isabelle to parse the lemma statement and proof correctly. After that, we can proceed with the logical steps of the proof. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the lemma statement using ASCII symbols:\n   - Change \"P1 ∧ Q1\" to \"P1 /\\ Q1\"\n   - Change \"P1 ⇒ P2\" to \"P1 ==> P2\"\n   - Change \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\" to \"Q1 ==> Q2\"\n   - Change \"P2 ∧ Q2\" to \"P2 /\\ Q2\"\n\n2. Update the 'obtain' statement in the proof:\n   - Change \"P1 ∧ Q1\" to \"P1 /\\ Q1\"\n\n3. After fixing the syntax, focus on breaking down the conjunction in the first assumption:\n   - Use the 'conjE' rule to split \"P1 /\\ Q1\" into separate facts P1 and Q1\n\n4. Then, apply the implications from the assumptions:\n   - Use 'mp' (modus ponens) with \"P1 ==> P2\" and P1 to derive P2\n   - Use 'mp' with \"Q1 ==> Q2\" and Q1 to derive Q2\n\n5. Finally, combine P2 and Q2 to form the conclusion:\n   - Use 'conjI' to prove \"P2 /\\ Q2\"\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to overcome the parsing issue and make progress in proving the theorem logically.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt contains syntax errors, particularly in the use of quotation marks and backticks, which are causing Isabelle to reject the input as malformed.\n\nImprovement: Revise the proof syntax by using proper Isabelle quotation marks (`) for referencing previous facts and removing unnecessary quotation marks around logical connectives and rule names.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The main issue causing the unsatisfactory result is the incorrect use of quotation marks in the proof. Isabelle has specific syntax requirements for referencing previous facts and applying rules.\n\n2. The effectiveness of past actions was limited by these syntax errors. While the logical structure of the proof seems correct, the improper use of quotation marks prevented Isabelle from parsing the proof correctly.\n\n3. To improve the next steps, we need to carefully revise the proof syntax:\n   - Use backticks (`) to reference previously established facts, e.g., `P1` instead of \"P1\".\n   - Remove quotation marks around logical connectives and rule names, e.g., use P2 /\\ Q2 instead of \"P2 /\\ Q2\" and rule conjI instead of (rule \"conjI\").\n   - Ensure that all quotation marks used are the correct type for Isabelle (backticks for referencing facts, no quotes for rules and connectives).\n\n4. By addressing these syntax issues, we'll be better aligned with the goal of successfully proving the theorem. The logical structure of the proof appears sound, so fixing the syntax should allow Isabelle to process and verify the proof.\n\n5. The use of 'sorry' was not observed in this attempt, which is good. We should continue to avoid using 'sorry' and focus on completing the proof rigorously.\n\nFor the next iteration, the LLM agent responsible for acting should carefully implement these syntax corrections while maintaining the logical structure of the proof. This should resolve the \"Malformed command syntax\" error and allow Isabelle to properly evaluate the proof.",
