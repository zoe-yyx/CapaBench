    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for logic_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the given assumptions:\n   - We have \"P1 ∧ Q1\" as a conjunction\n   - We have two implications: \"P1 ⇒ P2\" and \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\"\n   - Our goal is to prove \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n2. Break down the conjunction in the first assumption:\n   - Split \"P1 ∧ Q1\" into separate facts: P1 and Q1\n\n3. Use the split facts with the given implications:\n   - Apply \"P1 ⇒ P2\" to P1 to derive P2\n   - Apply \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\" to Q1 to derive Q2\n\n4. Combine the derived facts:\n   - Join P2 and Q2 to form the conjunction \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n5. Proof structure:\n   a. Start with 'proof -'\n   b. Use 'from' or 'using' to reference the assumptions\n   c. Apply 'have' statements to derive intermediate results\n   d. Use 'show' to demonstrate the final goal\n\n6. Possible tactics to consider:\n   - conjunction elimination (conjE) to split \"P1 ∧ Q1\"\n   - modus ponens (mp) or implication elimination (impE) for the implications\n   - conjunction introduction (conjI) to form the final \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n7. Finish the proof with 'qed'\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem logic_ex2 by leveraging the given assumptions and applying logical reasoning to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof attempt was close but failed due to an error in the logical flow. We need to modify the proof structure to correctly derive both P1 and Q1 from the first assumption before using them to prove P2 and Q2. Here's the reasoning for the correct proof structure:\n\n1. Start with 'proof -' to begin the proof.\n\n2. Use the first assumption (assms(1)) to derive both P1 and Q1:\n   - This can be done using conjunction elimination, which is automatically handled by the 'simp' method.\n   - Use 'from assms(1) have P1: \"P1\" and Q1: \"Q1\" by simp'\n\n3. Use P1 and the second assumption to derive P2:\n   - Apply modus ponens, which is also handled by 'simp'.\n   - Use 'from P1 assms(2) have P2: \"P2\" by simp'\n\n4. Use Q1 and the third assumption to derive Q2:\n   - Again, apply modus ponens with 'simp'.\n   - Use 'from Q1 assms(3) have Q2: \"Q2\" by simp'\n\n5. Combine P2 and Q2 to prove the final goal:\n   - Use conjunction introduction, which is handled by 'simp'.\n   - Use 'from P2 Q2 show ?thesis by simp'\n\n6. End the proof with 'qed'.\n\nThis structure ensures that each step is properly justified by the given assumptions and follows a logical sequence to prove the theorem.\n",
