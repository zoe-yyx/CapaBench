    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for logic_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the given assumptions:\n   - We have \"P1 ∧ Q1\" as a conjunction\n   - We have two implications: \"P1 ⇒ P2\" and \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\"\n   - Our goal is to prove \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n2. Break down the conjunction in the first assumption:\n   - Split \"P1 ∧ Q1\" into separate facts: P1 and Q1\n\n3. Use the split facts with the given implications:\n   - Apply \"P1 ⇒ P2\" to P1 to derive P2\n   - Apply \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\" to Q1 to derive Q2\n\n4. Combine the derived facts:\n   - Join P2 and Q2 to form the conjunction \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n5. Proof structure:\n   a. Start with 'proof -'\n   b. Use 'from' or 'using' to reference the assumptions\n   c. Apply 'have' statements to derive intermediate results\n   d. Use 'show' to demonstrate the final goal\n\n6. Possible tactics to consider:\n   - conjunction elimination (conjE) to split \"P1 ∧ Q1\"\n   - modus ponens (mp) or implication elimination (impE) for the implications\n   - conjunction introduction (conjI) to form the final \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n7. Finish the proof with 'qed'\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem logic_ex2 by leveraging the given assumptions and applying logical reasoning to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is not related to the proof logic, but to a system-level issue with Isabelle's SQLite database. The proof itself appears to be correct, so our focus should be on resolving the database access problem. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Database Permissions: The error message suggests that the database has become read-only. The acting agent should check the file permissions of the Isabelle database and ensure the user has write access.\n\n2. Database Location: The error indicates that the database file has been moved. Verify the current location of the database file and update Isabelle's configuration if necessary.\n\n3. Isabelle Environment: Consider restarting Isabelle or the computer to ensure all file handles are properly released.\n\n4. Temporary Workaround: If possible, try running Isabelle with elevated privileges (e.g., as administrator) to rule out permission issues.\n\n5. Isabelle Reinstallation: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, a clean reinstallation of Isabelle might be necessary. Ensure to backup any important files or configurations before proceeding.\n\n6. Alternative Input Method: As a last resort, consider using a different interface or method to input the proof, such as a command-line interface or exporting the proof to a different format.\n\nOnce the database issue is resolved, the existing proof should be reentered without changes, as the logic appears to be correct. The focus should be on fixing the technical environment rather than modifying the proof itself.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error is not related to the proof itself, but to a database constraint issue in Isabelle's SQLite database.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the SQLite database issue by checking for duplicate entries in the isabelle_session_info table, possibly clearing the database cache, or reinstalling Isabelle if necessary.\n```\n\nThe current error is not related to the proof logic or structure, which appears to be correct. Instead, we're facing a system-level issue with Isabelle's SQLite database. The error message indicates a PRIMARY KEY constraint failure, suggesting there might be an attempt to insert a duplicate entry into the isabelle_session_info table.\n\nTo improve our approach in the next steps:\n\n1. Database Integrity: The acting agent should check the Isabelle database for integrity issues. This might involve using SQLite tools to inspect the isabelle_session_info table for duplicate entries.\n\n2. Clear Cache: Try clearing Isabelle's cache, which might resolve issues with conflicting session information.\n\n3. Session Management: Ensure that there are no conflicting or leftover session files from previous attempts that might be causing the database to try and insert duplicate information.\n\n4. Isabelle Restart: A full restart of Isabelle, or even the computer, might help resolve any lingering issues with file handles or database connections.\n\n5. Reinstallation: If the problem persists, a clean reinstallation of Isabelle might be necessary. This should be done as a last resort, ensuring all important work is backed up first.\n\n6. Version Check: Verify that you're using the latest stable version of Isabelle, as the issue might have been addressed in a recent update.\n\nOnce the database issue is resolved, the existing proof should be reentered as is, since the logic is correct. The focus should be on fixing the technical environment to allow Isabelle to properly save and manage session information.",
