    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for logic_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the given assumptions:\n   - We have \"P1 ∧ Q1\" as a conjunction\n   - We have two implications: \"P1 ⇒ P2\" and \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\"\n   - Our goal is to prove \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n2. Break down the conjunction in the first assumption:\n   - Split \"P1 ∧ Q1\" into separate facts: P1 and Q1\n\n3. Use the split facts with the given implications:\n   - Apply \"P1 ⇒ P2\" to P1 to derive P2\n   - Apply \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\" to Q1 to derive Q2\n\n4. Combine the derived facts:\n   - Join P2 and Q2 to form the conjunction \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n5. Proof structure:\n   a. Start with 'proof -'\n   b. Use 'from' or 'using' to reference the assumptions\n   c. Apply 'have' statements to derive intermediate results\n   d. Use 'show' to demonstrate the final goal\n\n6. Possible tactics to consider:\n   - conjunction elimination (conjE) to split \"P1 ∧ Q1\"\n   - modus ponens (mp) or implication elimination (impE) for the implications\n   - conjunction introduction (conjI) to form the final \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n7. Finish the proof with 'qed'\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem logic_ex2 by leveraging the given assumptions and applying logical reasoning to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by setting up the proof structure and then break down the first assumption. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Begin the proof with 'proof -' to start a raw proof without any initial simplification.\n\n2. Our first goal should be to break down the conjunction in the first assumption \"P1 ∧ Q1\". We can do this using the 'obtain' command, which will allow us to get P1 and Q1 as separate facts.\n\n3. After obtaining P1 and Q1, we can use these facts along with the given implications to derive P2 and Q2 separately.\n\n4. Once we have P2 and Q2, we can combine them to show the final goal \"P2 ∧ Q2\".\n\nBased on this reasoning, I suggest the acting agent start with the following steps:\n\n1. Begin the proof with 'proof -'\n2. Use 'obtain' to break down the first assumption into P1 and Q1\n3. Prepare to use these facts in the subsequent steps of the proof\n\nThis approach aligns with the planning strategy and sets up a solid foundation for the rest of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered a lexical error due to the use of non-ASCII characters for logical operators.\nImprovement: Replace all non-ASCII logical symbols with their ASCII equivalents (e.g., '∧' with '/\\', '⇒' with '==>', '∀' with '!') to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parsing.\n```\n\nThe current result is unsatisfactory because Isabelle failed to parse the proposition due to the use of Unicode symbols for logical operators. This is a common issue when copying text from other sources or when using a system that automatically replaces ASCII symbols with their Unicode equivalents.\n\nTo improve the next steps, we should:\n\n1. Review and replace all logical symbols in the lemma statement and proof with their ASCII equivalents:\n   - Replace '∧' with '/\\'\n   - Replace '⇒' with '==>'\n\n2. Be consistent with the use of ASCII symbols throughout the entire proof, including in the 'obtain' statement and any future steps.\n\n3. Double-check that all quotation marks are standard ASCII quotation marks (\") rather than any curly or smart quotes that might have been introduced.\n\n4. After making these changes, attempt to re-run the proof to ensure that the lexical error is resolved.\n\n5. Once the parsing issue is fixed, proceed with the original proving strategy, focusing on breaking down the conjunction and using the given assumptions to derive the conclusion.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to overcome the current parsing issue and move forward with the actual logical reasoning required to prove the theorem.",
