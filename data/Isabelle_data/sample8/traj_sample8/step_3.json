    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for logic_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the given assumptions:\n   - We have \"P1 ∧ Q1\" as a conjunction\n   - We have two implications: \"P1 ⇒ P2\" and \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\"\n   - Our goal is to prove \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n2. Break down the conjunction in the first assumption:\n   - Split \"P1 ∧ Q1\" into separate facts: P1 and Q1\n\n3. Use the split facts with the given implications:\n   - Apply \"P1 ⇒ P2\" to P1 to derive P2\n   - Apply \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\" to Q1 to derive Q2\n\n4. Combine the derived facts:\n   - Join P2 and Q2 to form the conjunction \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n5. Proof structure:\n   a. Start with 'proof -'\n   b. Use 'from' or 'using' to reference the assumptions\n   c. Apply 'have' statements to derive intermediate results\n   d. Use 'show' to demonstrate the final goal\n\n6. Possible tactics to consider:\n   - conjunction elimination (conjE) to split \"P1 ∧ Q1\"\n   - modus ponens (mp) or implication elimination (impE) for the implications\n   - conjunction introduction (conjI) to form the final \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n7. Finish the proof with 'qed'\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem logic_ex2 by leveraging the given assumptions and applying logical reasoning to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure and logical steps are correct, but we need to address the lexical error caused by Unicode symbols. To resolve this issue and allow Isabelle to properly parse the input, we should:\n\n1. Replace all Unicode logical symbols with their ASCII equivalents:\n   - Change \"∧\" to \"/\\\"\n   - Change \"⟹\" to \"==>\"\n\n2. Replace Unicode quotes with standard double quotes:\n   - Change \"‹\" and \"›\" to \"\"\"\n\n3. Maintain the existing proof structure and logical steps, as they are correct.\n\n4. Ensure consistent use of quotation marks throughout the proof.\n\nBy making these changes, we should be able to resolve the lexical error while preserving the logical integrity of the proof. This will allow Isabelle to process and verify the theorem correctly.\n\nThe acting agent should carefully go through the proof, making these symbol replacements line by line, ensuring that the logical structure remains intact. After these changes, Isabelle should be able to parse the input without errors, allowing us to proceed with verifying the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error message indicates a database constraint issue rather than a problem with the proof itself, suggesting a system-level problem unrelated to the logical structure of our proof.\n\nImprovement: We should verify the Isabelle environment setup and database integrity, ensuring that there are no conflicts or corrupted data in the session information, before attempting to run the proof again.\n```\n\nGiven the nature of the error message, which points to a SQLite database constraint violation, the issue lies outside the scope of our proof logic or syntax. This is likely a system or environment problem that needs to be addressed at the Isabelle installation or configuration level.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. The planning agent should consider investigating the Isabelle environment setup, focusing on the database that stores session information.\n\n2. The reasoning agent should explore potential causes for this database error, such as conflicting session names, corrupted database files, or permission issues.\n\n3. The acting agent should focus on troubleshooting steps such as:\n   - Verifying the integrity of the Isabelle installation\n   - Checking for and resolving any conflicts in session names\n   - Ensuring proper permissions for the database files\n   - Potentially rebuilding the session database if necessary\n\n4. Once the environment issue is resolved, we should re-run the proof without any changes, as the logical structure and syntax appear to be correct.\n\n5. If the database issue persists, it may be necessary to consult Isabelle documentation or support channels for more specific troubleshooting steps related to this SQLite constraint error.\n\nRemember, the proof itself seems logically sound and syntactically correct after our previous adjustments. The focus now should be on resolving this external issue to allow Isabelle to properly process and verify the proof.",
