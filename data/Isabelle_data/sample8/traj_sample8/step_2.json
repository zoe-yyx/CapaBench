    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for logic_ex2:\n\n1. Analyze the given assumptions:\n   - We have \"P1 ∧ Q1\" as a conjunction\n   - We have two implications: \"P1 ⇒ P2\" and \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\"\n   - Our goal is to prove \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n2. Break down the conjunction in the first assumption:\n   - Split \"P1 ∧ Q1\" into separate facts: P1 and Q1\n\n3. Use the split facts with the given implications:\n   - Apply \"P1 ⇒ P2\" to P1 to derive P2\n   - Apply \"Q1 ⇒ Q2\" to Q1 to derive Q2\n\n4. Combine the derived facts:\n   - Join P2 and Q2 to form the conjunction \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n5. Proof structure:\n   a. Start with 'proof -'\n   b. Use 'from' or 'using' to reference the assumptions\n   c. Apply 'have' statements to derive intermediate results\n   d. Use 'show' to demonstrate the final goal\n\n6. Possible tactics to consider:\n   - conjunction elimination (conjE) to split \"P1 ∧ Q1\"\n   - modus ponens (mp) or implication elimination (impE) for the implications\n   - conjunction introduction (conjI) to form the final \"P2 ∧ Q2\"\n\n7. Finish the proof with 'qed'\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem logic_ex2 by leveraging the given assumptions and applying logical reasoning to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure and logical steps in the historical action are correct, but there are syntax issues that need to be addressed. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Maintain the overall proof structure, as it follows the planning strategy correctly:\n   - It starts with 'proof -'\n   - It uses 'from' to reference assumptions\n   - It applies 'have' statements for intermediate results\n   - It uses 'show' for the final goal\n   - It ends with 'qed'\n\n2. Correct the syntax errors:\n   - Remove quotation marks around logical connectives (/\\, ==>) in the assumes and shows lines.\n   - Use backticks (`) instead of double quotes (\") when referencing previously established facts.\n   - Remove quotation marks around rule names in the proof steps.\n\n3. Keep the logical steps of the proof:\n   - Split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 into separate facts P1 and Q1.\n   - Derive P2 from P1 using the second assumption.\n   - Derive Q2 from Q1 using the third assumption.\n   - Combine P2 and Q2 to show the final goal.\n\n4. Use the correct Isabelle syntax for referencing facts and applying rules:\n   - Use `P1` and `Q1` when referring to these facts after they're established.\n   - Apply rules without quotation marks, e.g., (rule conjE) instead of (rule \"conjE\").\n\n5. Maintain the use of 'moreover' and 'ultimately' for structuring the proof, as they correctly indicate the flow of logical reasoning.\n\nBy implementing these corrections while keeping the logical structure intact, the proof should be accepted by Isabelle and successfully verify the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof contains Unicode symbols that are not properly recognized by Isabelle, causing a lexical error.\n\nImprovement: Replace all Unicode logical symbols (∧, ⟹) with their ASCII equivalents (/\\, ==>), and use standard quotation marks instead of Unicode quotes to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and logical steps are correct, but the use of Unicode symbols is causing parsing issues. Isabelle typically uses ASCII representations for logical symbols in its input syntax. To resolve this, we need to replace the Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents:\n\n1. Replace ∧ with /\\\n2. Replace ⟹ with ==>\n3. Replace Unicode quotes (‹ ›) with standard double quotes (\" \")\n\nAdditionally, ensure that all quotation marks are consistent and in the correct format for Isabelle. By making these changes, we should be able to resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to process the proof correctly.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should implement these changes while maintaining the logical structure of the proof. This should allow Isabelle to parse the input correctly and verify the theorem.",
