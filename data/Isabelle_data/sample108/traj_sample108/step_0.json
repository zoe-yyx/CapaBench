Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a universally quantified statement over two integer variables n and m.\n   - It's a disjunction of two clauses: n < m and Â¬(n < m).\n\n2. Recognize the logical principle:\n   - This theorem is an instance of the law of excluded middle for the relation \"<\" on integers.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Start with the 'allI' rule to introduce universal quantifiers for n and m.\n   b. Apply the 'classic' method to use classical reasoning (law of excluded middle).\n   c. Use the 'auto' method to finish the proof, as it should be able to handle the simple disjunction.\n\n4. Potential alternative approaches:\n   - If 'auto' doesn't work, consider breaking down the proof:\n     a. Use 'rule disjI1' to prove the left disjunct.\n     b. Use 'rule disjI2' to prove the right disjunct.\n     c. Show that one of these must be true for any n and m.\n\n5. Considerations:\n   - The theorem is straightforward and doesn't require any specific lemmas or complex reasoning.\n   - It's a fundamental property of ordered structures like integers.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - After proving, consider the implications of this theorem in integer theory.\n   - Think about how this relates to the completeness of the integer order.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem not_ex1, which states \"\\<forall>n m::int. n < m \\<or> \\<not> (n < m)\", we should follow the planned strategy:\n\n1. Start by applying the 'allI' rule twice to introduce universal quantifiers for n and m. This will allow us to work with arbitrary integers n and m.\n\n2. After introducing the quantifiers, we should apply the 'classic' method. This method is appropriate because our theorem is essentially a statement of the law of excluded middle for the relation \"<\" on integers.\n\n3. Once we've applied 'classic', the 'auto' method should be able to complete the proof automatically, as the remaining goal will be a simple disjunction that auto can handle.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent proceed with applying these methods in sequence: allI, allI, classic, and then auto. This approach directly follows our planned strategy and should efficiently prove the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was correct, but the error indicates a database constraint issue rather than a problem with the proof itself.\nImprovement: We should verify the Isabelle environment setup and ensure there are no conflicts or issues with the session database before attempting to prove the theorem again.\n```\n\nBased on the current observation, it appears that the proof attempt for the theorem not_ex1 was actually correct and complete. The error message we received is not related to the proof itself, but rather to a database constraint issue in the Isabelle environment.\n\nThe error \"SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY\" suggests that there might be a problem with the Isabelle session database, possibly due to a duplicate entry or a conflict in the primary key constraints.\n\nTo move forward, we should consider the following:\n\n1. The proof strategy and execution appear to be correct, so we don't need to modify the proof itself.\n\n2. The issue lies in the Isabelle environment or setup, not in our theorem proving process.\n\n3. We need to address the database constraint issue before we can successfully certify the proof.\n\nFor the next steps, I recommend:\n\n1. Verify the Isabelle installation and ensure all components are up to date.\n\n2. Check for any conflicting or duplicate session information in the Isabelle environment.\n\n3. If possible, try to clear or reset the Isabelle session database.\n\n4. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to consult Isabelle documentation or seek support from the Isabelle community regarding this specific database error.\n\nOnce the environment issue is resolved, we should be able to run the proof again without changes, as the proof structure and steps are correct for the given theorem.",
