Break down the proof into two parts:\n   a. Prove left to right: P ∧ (P ∨ Q) → P\n   b. Prove right to left: P → P ∧ (P ∨ Q)\n\n3. For the left to right direction:\n   - Use the rule \"conjE\" to split the conjunction\n   - Show that P is directly given in the left side of the conjunction\n\n4. For the right to left direction:\n   - Use the rule \"conjI\" to prove the conjunction\n   - For the left part of the conjunction, use the assumption P\n   - For the right part, use \"disjI1\" to prove P ∨ Q from P\n\n5. Combine both directions using the \"iffI\" rule to prove the bidirectional implication\n\n6. Consider using Isabelle's automated tools:\n   - Try \"auto\" tactic first\n   - If \"auto\" doesn't solve it completely, use it to simplify and then proceed with manual steps\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and have not taken any actions yet, our first step should be to attempt using Isabelle's automated tools. The \"auto\" tactic is a good starting point as it can often solve simple logical equivalences or at least simplify them significantly.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem \"and_or_absorb\" is a straightforward logical equivalence involving conjunction and disjunction.\n2. Automated tools like \"auto\" are often effective for such basic logical statements.\n3. Even if \"auto\" doesn't solve the problem completely, it may simplify it and give us a clearer picture of what remains to be proved.\n\nTherefore, I recommend starting with the \"auto\" tactic. This aligns with step 6 of our planning strategy and is a efficient way to begin the proof. If \"auto\" doesn't complete the proof, we can then proceed with more specific manual steps based on the resulting state.\n",
