    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for mul_assoc:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove the associativity of multiplication for our custom natural number type (mynat).\n   - The theorem states: mymul n (mymul m p) = mymul (mymul n m) p\n\n2. Identify available resources:\n   - We have definitions for myadd and mymul functions.\n   - We have two theorems that are already proved (but using sorry):\n     a. mymul_add_distr_r: Distributivity of multiplication over addition\n     b. myadd_assoc: Associativity of addition\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Use structural induction on n:\n      - Base case: n = MyZero\n      - Inductive case: n = MySuc n'\n\n4. Plan for the base case (n = MyZero):\n   - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of mymul.\n\n5. Plan for the inductive case (n = MySuc n'):\n   a. Apply the definition of mymul to expand the left-hand side.\n   b. Use the inductive hypothesis.\n   c. Apply mymul_add_distr_r to redistribute multiplication.\n   d. Use the definition of mymul again.\n   e. Apply myadd_assoc to regroup terms.\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Combine the base case and inductive case.\n   - Use simplification and rewriting tactics to complete the proof.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure all steps are justified.\n   - Check that the proof covers all cases and uses available theorems effectively.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and the reflection provided, here is my reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The first priority is to correct the syntax error in the type declarations. The acting agent should replace all instances of \"â‡’\" with \"=>\" in the definitions of myadd and mymul functions. This is crucial for the theorem prover to parse the theory file correctly.\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   Once the syntax is corrected, the existing proof structure using induction on n is appropriate and should be maintained. This aligns with our initial plan and is the correct approach for proving the associativity of multiplication.\n\n3. Base Case (MyZero):\n   After fixing the syntax, the acting agent should focus on proving the base case. The strategy here is to use simplification tactics to reduce both sides of the equation using the definition of mymul for MyZero. This should be relatively straightforward and can be done using the 'simp' tactic.\n\n4. Inductive Case (MySuc n'):\n   For the inductive case, the proof will be more complex. The acting agent should:\n   a. Apply the definition of mymul to expand the left-hand side of the equation.\n   b. Use the inductive hypothesis to simplify part of the expanded expression.\n   c. Apply the mymul_add_distr_r theorem to redistribute multiplication.\n   d. Use the definition of mymul again to simplify further.\n   e. Apply the myadd_assoc theorem to regroup terms.\n   f. Simplify the resulting expression to match the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n5. Auxiliary Theorems:\n   It's important to note that the mymul_add_distr_r and myadd_assoc theorems are currently marked with 'sorry'. While we can proceed with the proof assuming these theorems, it would be more rigorous to prove them first. The acting agent should consider proving these theorems before completing the mul_assoc proof, or at least flag them for future proof.\n\n6. Tactics to Use:\n   The acting agent should make use of tactics such as 'simp' for simplification, 'rewrite' for applying theorems, and possibly 'auto' for automated reasoning. Manual application of rules using 'apply' might be necessary for more complex steps.\n\n7. Step-by-Step Approach:\n   It's recommended to proceed with the proof step-by-step, verifying each step along the way. This will help identify any issues early and ensure a solid proof construction.\n\nBy following this reasoning, the acting agent should be able to make significant progress in proving the mul_assoc theorem, starting with fixing the syntax error and then systematically working through the base case and inductive case.\n",
