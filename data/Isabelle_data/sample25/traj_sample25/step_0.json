Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Use structural induction on n:\n      - Base case: n = MyZero\n      - Inductive case: n = MySuc n'\n\n4. Plan for the base case (n = MyZero):\n   - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of mymul.\n\n5. Plan for the inductive case (n = MySuc n'):\n   a.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're starting from scratch with the theorem mul_assoc, our first step should be to set up the proof structure using induction on n. This aligns with step 3 of our planning strategy.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem involves the mymul function, which is defined recursively on its first argument. This suggests that induction on n would be an appropriate approach.\n\n2. We should start by applying induction on n. This will give us two cases to prove:\n   a. Base case: n = MyZero\n   b. Inductive case: n = MySuc n' (for some n')\n\n3. For the induction to work, we need to generalize over m and p, treating them as arbitrary mynat values.\n\n4. After setting up the induction, we'll need to prove each case separately.\n\n5. In the base case (n = MyZero), we can use simplification tactics to reduce both sides of the equation using the definition of mymul.\n\n6. In the inductive case (n = MySuc n'), we'll need to expand the definition of mymul, use the inductive hypothesis, and then apply the other theorems (mymul_add_distr_r and myadd_assoc) as outlined in the planning strategy.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n and setting up the proof structure for both the base case and the inductive case.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but there's a syntax error in the type declarations using \"⇒\" instead of \"=>\".\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in the type declarations for myadd and mymul functions to resolve the lexical error and proceed with the proof.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that while the overall approach to proving the theorem is on the right track, there's a fundamental syntax issue that's preventing the proof from even starting. The use of \"⇒\" instead of \"=>\" in the type declarations is causing a lexical error.\n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. The acting agent should carefully review and correct the syntax in the theory file, particularly focusing on the type declarations for myadd and mymul functions.\n\n2. After fixing the syntax, the proof structure that has been set up (using induction on n) can be maintained, as it is correct and aligns with the planned approach.\n\n3. Once the syntax is corrected, the focus should shift to completing the proofs for the base case (MyZero) and the inductive case (MySuc n').\n\n4. The reasoning agent should then proceed with the detailed steps for each case, using simplification tactics for the base case and applying the auxiliary theorems (mymul_add_distr_r and myadd_assoc) in the inductive case.\n\n5. It's important to note that the auxiliary theorems are currently marked with 'sorry'. The team should consider whether these theorems need to be proved first before proceeding with the main theorem, or if they can be assumed for now.\n\nBy addressing the syntax issue and then following through with the planned proof strategy, the team should be able to make progress on proving the mul_assoc theorem.",
