    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is \"modus_ponens: P → Q ⟹ P ⟹ Q\"\n   - This is a fundamental logical principle known as Modus Ponens\n   - The theorem states: If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true\n\n2. Identify the Assumptions:\n   - Assumption 1: P → Q (P implies Q)\n   - Assumption 2: P (P is true)\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the given assumptions\n   b. Apply the first assumption (P → Q) to the second assumption (P)\n   c. Derive Q as the conclusion\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   a. Begin the proof by stating the assumptions\n   b. Use the implication elimination rule (also known as Modus Ponens) to derive Q\n   c. Conclude the proof by showing that Q follows from the assumptions\n\n5. Potential Isabelle Tactics:\n   - assume: To introduce the assumptions\n   - then: To chain reasoning steps\n   - show: To state the conclusion\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the conclusion (Q) is properly derived from the assumptions\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the fundamental logical principle of Modus Ponens\n   - It shows how to derive a conclusion from an implication and its antecedent\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof attempt for the modus_ponens theorem appears to be logically correct, but we're encountering a technical issue unrelated to the proof itself. The error message indicates a database constraint failure, specifically a primary key violation in the isabelle_session_info table.\n\nGiven this situation, our immediate focus should be on resolving the technical issue rather than modifying the proof. Here's what we should consider:\n\n1. Environment Check: Verify that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and all necessary components are correctly installed.\n\n2. Database Integrity: Investigate the database used by Isabelle for session information. The error suggests there might be a conflict or corruption in the session data.\n\n3. Session Management: Consider clearing any existing session data or restarting the Isabelle environment to ensure a clean slate for the proof attempt.\n\n4. Proof Preservation: Keep the current proof structure intact, as it appears to be logically sound and follows the correct steps for proving modus ponens.\n\n5. Re-attempt: Once the technical issues are resolved, re-run the exact same proof to verify its correctness within a properly functioning environment.\n\n6. Fallback Strategy: If the database issue persists, consider alternative methods of running the proof, such as using a different Isabelle interface or temporarily bypassing session storage if possible.\n\nThe next action should focus on addressing these technical aspects rather than modifying the proof itself. Once we have a stable environment, we can then proceed with evaluating and potentially optimizing the proof if necessary.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt is logically correct, but a technical issue with the Isabelle database is preventing successful execution.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the database access issue, specifically the readonly status and file movement problem, before re-attempting the proof with the same logical structure.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure for the modus_ponens theorem is logically sound and follows the correct steps. However, the execution is failing due to a technical issue with Isabelle's database. The error message suggests that the database file has been moved and is now in a readonly state, preventing the system from writing necessary information.\n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. Database Access: Investigate why the database has become readonly. This could be due to file system permissions, disk space issues, or unexpected file movement.\n\n2. File Location: Check if the database file has indeed been moved. If so, update Isabelle's configuration to point to the correct location.\n\n3. Permissions: Ensure that the user running Isabelle has the necessary permissions to read and write to the database file.\n\n4. Reinstallation Consideration: If the issue persists, consider reinstalling Isabelle to ensure all components are correctly set up.\n\n5. Alternative Proof Methods: While resolving the technical issues, explore if there are alternative ways to input and verify the proof that don't rely on the problematic database system.\n\n6. Proof Preservation: Keep the current proof structure intact, as it is logically correct. Once the technical issues are resolved, this proof should execute successfully.\n\nBy addressing these technical aspects, we can create an environment where the proof can be successfully executed and verified. The focus should be on resolving the database issue rather than modifying the proof itself, as the logical structure of the proof appears to be correct.",
