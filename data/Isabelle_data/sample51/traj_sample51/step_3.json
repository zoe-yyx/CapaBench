    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is \"modus_ponens: P → Q ⟹ P ⟹ Q\"\n   - This is a fundamental logical principle known as Modus Ponens\n   - The theorem states: If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true\n\n2. Identify the Assumptions:\n   - Assumption 1: P → Q (P implies Q)\n   - Assumption 2: P (P is true)\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the given assumptions\n   b. Apply the first assumption (P → Q) to the second assumption (P)\n   c. Derive Q as the conclusion\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   a. Begin the proof by stating the assumptions\n   b. Use the implication elimination rule (also known as Modus Ponens) to derive Q\n   c. Conclude the proof by showing that Q follows from the assumptions\n\n5. Potential Isabelle Tactics:\n   - assume: To introduce the assumptions\n   - then: To chain reasoning steps\n   - show: To state the conclusion\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the conclusion (Q) is properly derived from the assumptions\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the fundamental logical principle of Modus Ponens\n   - It shows how to derive a conclusion from an implication and its antecedent\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the technical nature of the error encountered, our immediate focus should be on resolving the Isabelle session management issue rather than modifying the proof itself. The proof strategy using 'by simp' is correct and sufficient for the modus_ponens theorem. However, we need to ensure that the proving environment is functioning properly before we can verify the proof. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Environment Troubleshooting: The acting agent should first focus on troubleshooting the Isabelle environment. This includes:\n   a. Checking for any corrupted session data\n   b. Verifying proper installation and configuration of Isabelle\n   c. Ensuring correct permissions for database access\n\n2. Fresh Session Attempt: If the environment checks out, try creating a new Isabelle session from scratch. This might help bypass any existing session conflicts.\n\n3. Alternative Proof Input: While resolving the database issue, consider using an alternative method to input and verify the proof, such as:\n   a. Using the Isabelle/jEdit interface\n   b. Writing the proof in a plain text file and importing it into Isabelle once the issue is resolved\n\n4. Maintain Proof Structure: Keep the current proof structure ('by simp') as it is correct. Once the technical issues are resolved, this proof should work without modification.\n\n5. Systematic Error Resolution: If the issue persists, systematically eliminate potential causes:\n   a. Try proving a simpler theorem to isolate whether the problem is specific to this proof or a general system issue\n   b. Check for any recent changes in the Isabelle setup or environment that might have triggered this error\n\n6. Community Support: If all else fails, consider reaching out to the Isabelle community or official support channels for specialized assistance with this database constraint error.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create an environment where we can successfully verify our proof. The logical structure of the proof is sound; we just need to overcome this technical hurdle to proceed with formal verification.\n",
