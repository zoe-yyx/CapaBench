    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem to prove is \"modus_ponens: P → Q ⟹ P ⟹ Q\"\n   - This is a fundamental logical principle known as Modus Ponens\n   - The theorem states: If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true\n\n2. Identify the Assumptions:\n   - Assumption 1: P → Q (P implies Q)\n   - Assumption 2: P (P is true)\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Start with the given assumptions\n   b. Apply the first assumption (P → Q) to the second assumption (P)\n   c. Derive Q as the conclusion\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   a. Begin the proof by stating the assumptions\n   b. Use the implication elimination rule (also known as Modus Ponens) to derive Q\n   c. Conclude the proof by showing that Q follows from the assumptions\n\n5. Potential Isabelle Tactics:\n   - assume: To introduce the assumptions\n   - then: To chain reasoning steps\n   - show: To state the conclusion\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the conclusion (Q) is properly derived from the assumptions\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the fundamental logical principle of Modus Ponens\n   - It shows how to derive a conclusion from an implication and its antecedent\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure for the modus_ponens theorem is logically correct and follows the planned strategy. The issue we're facing is not with the proof itself, but with a technical problem in Isabelle's database system. Here's how we should proceed:\n\n1. Technical Issue Resolution:\n   - Before attempting to modify the proof, we need to address the database readonly issue. This is likely a system-level problem that requires attention outside of the proof environment.\n   - The acting agent should check the file permissions and location of the Isabelle database, ensuring it has write access and is in the expected location.\n\n2. Proof Structure Preservation:\n   - The current proof structure is sound and aligns with our planned strategy. We should maintain this structure once the technical issues are resolved.\n   - The proof correctly assumes the premises, applies modus ponens, and shows the conclusion.\n\n3. Alternative Verification:\n   - While the database issue is being resolved, we can verify the logical correctness of the proof manually or using a different tool if available.\n   - This will help confirm that our proof structure is indeed correct and ready for formal verification once the system issues are fixed.\n\n4. Next Steps After Resolution:\n   - Once the database issue is resolved, the acting agent should attempt to run the exact same proof again.\n   - If successful, this will complete our proof of the modus_ponens theorem.\n   - If issues persist, we may need to explore alternative tactics or proof methods within Isabelle, but only after confirming that the technical problems have been fully addressed.\n\n5. Backup Plan:\n   - If the database issues prove difficult to resolve quickly, consider temporarily using a simpler proof method that might bypass the database writing issue, such as using 'by simp' instead of explicit proof steps.\n   - This could allow progress on the logical aspect while technical issues are being addressed in parallel.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on resolving the technical database issue first, then re-attempt the current proof structure. Only if that fails after technical resolution should we consider modifying the proof itself.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered a database constraint error, indicating a technical issue with Isabelle's session management rather than a problem with the proof itself.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the Isabelle session management issue before attempting to prove the theorem again, ensuring that the database can properly store session information without conflicts.\n```\n\nThe current situation reveals that the problem lies not in the proof strategy or logical reasoning, but in the underlying system that Isabelle uses to manage sessions and store information. This technical hurdle is preventing us from successfully verifying our proof, even though the proof itself (using 'by simp') is correct and sufficient for the modus_ponens theorem.\n\nTo move forward effectively:\n\n1. Technical Investigation: The acting agent should investigate the Isabelle installation and configuration. This error suggests there might be conflicts in the session database, possibly due to duplicate entries or corrupted data.\n\n2. Environment Check: Verify that the Isabelle environment is properly set up, including correct permissions and paths to all necessary components.\n\n3. Clean Start: Consider starting a fresh Isabelle session, or even reinstalling Isabelle if the issue persists. This might help eliminate any corrupted session data.\n\n4. Alternative Proof Methods: While the database issue is being resolved, we could explore alternative ways to input and verify the proof that might bypass the session management system. For example, using the Isabelle/jEdit interface or a different proof assistant temporarily to verify the logical correctness of our approach.\n\n5. Documentation: Keep a record of the steps taken to resolve this issue. This will be valuable if similar problems occur in future proofs or for other users encountering the same error.\n\n6. Proof Preservation: Maintain the current proof structure ('by simp') as it is correct and concise. Once the technical issues are resolved, this proof should be immediately verifiable.\n\n7. Escalation: If the issue persists after attempting these solutions, consider reaching out to the Isabelle community or support channels for more specialized assistance with this database constraint error.\n\nThe key is to separate the technical issues from the logical proof. Our proof strategy is sound, but we need to ensure the proving environment is functioning correctly before we can proceed with formal verification.",
