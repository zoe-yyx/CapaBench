    "reasoning": "\nTo address the timeout issue and simplify our proof, we should take the following approach:\n\n1. Start with a single proof block using the 'intro' method to introduce the antecedent as an assumption.\n\n2. Use the 'simp' method with specific rules to break down the conjunction in the antecedent and simplify the bi-implications. This will replace our manual conjE steps.\n\n3. For the main proof of the bi-implication in the consequent, use the 'rule' method with 'iffI' to prove both directions simultaneously.\n\n4. For each direction of the bi-implication, use the 'case' method to perform case analysis on the disjunctions. This replaces our manual disjE steps.\n\n5. Within each case, use the 'simp' method with the assumptions from the antecedent to prove the goals directly. This will handle the logical reasoning more efficiently than our previous manual steps.\n\n6. If 'simp' doesn't solve all goals, consider using 'auto' or 'blast' for any remaining complex logical reasoning.\n\n7. Use 'qed' to complete the proof once all subgoals are solved.\n\nThis approach should significantly reduce the complexity of our proof structure and leverage Isabelle's built-in tactics more effectively, potentially resolving the timeout issue.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is using the 'cases' method incorrectly for disjunction elimination, leading to undefined cases.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'cases' with 'elim disjE' for proper disjunction elimination, and use 'simp' with the specific bi-implications from the assumptions to prove each case.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is on the right track, but there are some issues with the implementation of the case analysis for the disjunctions. Here's a more detailed reflection:\n\n1. The use of 'cases' for disjunction elimination is incorrect. In Isabelle, 'cases' is typically used for inductive definitions or datatypes, not for logical connectives like disjunction.\n\n2. Instead of 'cases', we should use 'elim disjE' for disjunction elimination. This will properly split the disjunction into its components.\n\n3. The 'with assms show ?thesis by simp' approach is good, but we can make it more precise by specifying which part of the assumption we're using.\n\n4. We should also consider adding labels to our assumptions to make them easier to reference.\n\nFor the next attempt, we should:\n\n1. Use 'elim disjE' instead of 'cases' for disjunction elimination.\n2. Label the parts of the assumption for easier reference.\n3. Use 'simp' with specific parts of the assumption for each case.\n4. Consider using 'auto' at the end of each case if 'simp' doesn't fully solve the goal.\n\nThese changes should resolve the \"undefined case\" error and lead to a successful proof of the lemma.",
