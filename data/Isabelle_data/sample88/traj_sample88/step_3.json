Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication (A → B)\n   - A is a conjunction of two bi-implications\n   - B is a bi-implication of two disjunctions\n\n2. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use the 'intro' method to introduce the antecedent as an assumption\n   b. Break down the conjunction in the antecedent using 'conjE'\n   c. Prove the bi-implication in the consequent by showing both directions:\n      - Left to right: (P1 ∨ Q1) → (P2 ∨ Q2)\n      - Right to left: (P2 ∨ Q2) → (P1 ∨ Q1)\n\n3. For each direction of the bi-implication:\n   a. Introduce the assumption of the disjunction\n   b. Use case analysis on the disjunction with 'disjE'\n   c. For each case, use the corresponding bi-implication from the antecedent\n   d. Apply disjunction introduction ('disjI') to prove the goal\n\n4. Use basic logical reasoning techniques:\n   - Apply elimination and introduction rules for conjunctions, disjunctions, and implications\n   - Utilize the 'simp' method for simplification where appropriate\n\n5. Finish the proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are closed\n   - Use 'qed' to complete the proof\n\n6. If stuck:\n   - Consider using 'auto' or 'blast' for automated proving\n   - Break down the proof into smaller lemmas if needed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is correct and has successfully proven the theorem. The error occurs because we're trying to apply additional proof methods (by simp auto) when the proof is already complete. To resolve this issue and improve the proof:\n\n1. Remove all instances of 'by simp auto' at the end of each case in both directions of the bi-implication.\n2. Replace 'show ?thesis by simp auto' with simply 'show ?thesis' in each case.\n3. Keep the overall structure of the proof intact, as it correctly demonstrates the logical steps needed to prove the theorem.\n\nThis modification will eliminate the unnecessary application of terminal proof methods when there are no subgoals left, resulting in a cleaner and more efficient proof. The proof will still rigorously demonstrate the theorem, but without the redundant steps that were causing the error.\n\nAfter making these changes, the proof should successfully terminate without any errors, and the theorem will be proven.\n",
