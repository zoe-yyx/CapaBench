    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication (A → B)\n   - A is a conjunction of two bi-implications\n   - B is a bi-implication of two disjunctions\n\n2. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use the 'intro' method to introduce the antecedent as an assumption\n   b. Break down the conjunction in the antecedent using 'conjE'\n   c. Prove the bi-implication in the consequent by showing both directions:\n      - Left to right: (P1 ∨ Q1) → (P2 ∨ Q2)\n      - Right to left: (P2 ∨ Q2) → (P1 ∨ Q1)\n\n3. For each direction of the bi-implication:\n   a. Introduce the assumption of the disjunction\n   b. Use case analysis on the disjunction with 'disjE'\n   c. For each case, use the corresponding bi-implication from the antecedent\n   d. Apply disjunction introduction ('disjI') to prove the goal\n\n4. Use basic logical reasoning techniques:\n   - Apply elimination and introduction rules for conjunctions, disjunctions, and implications\n   - Utilize the 'simp' method for simplification where appropriate\n\n5. Finish the proof:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are closed\n   - Use 'qed' to complete the proof\n\n6. If stuck:\n   - Consider using 'auto' or 'blast' for automated proving\n   - Break down the proof into smaller lemmas if needed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is correct, but we need to modify the case analysis for the disjunctions. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. After the 'proof' command, we should label the parts of our assumption for easier reference:\n   assume assms: \"(P1 \\<longleftrightarrow> P2) \\<and> (Q1 \\<longleftrightarrow> Q2)\"\n   from assms have P_equiv: \"P1 \\<longleftrightarrow> P2\" and Q_equiv: \"Q1 \\<longleftrightarrow> Q2\" by simp_all\n\n2. In the first direction of the bi-implication (P1 ∨ Q1 → P2 ∨ Q2):\n   - Replace 'proof (cases)' with 'proof (elim disjE)'\n   - For the P1 case, use 'with P_equiv show ?thesis by simp'\n   - For the Q1 case, use 'with Q_equiv show ?thesis by simp'\n\n3. In the second direction of the bi-implication (P2 ∨ Q2 → P1 ∨ Q1):\n   - Replace 'proof (cases)' with 'proof (elim disjE)'\n   - For the P2 case, use 'with P_equiv show ?thesis by simp'\n   - For the Q2 case, use 'with Q_equiv show ?thesis by simp'\n\n4. If 'simp' doesn't fully solve any of the cases, consider adding 'auto' after it:\n   'with P_equiv show ?thesis by simp auto' (and similarly for Q_equiv)\n\nThese changes should resolve the \"undefined case\" error and complete the proof successfully.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is actually complete, but the terminal proof method is unnecessarily applied when there are no subgoals left.\n\nImprovement: Remove the terminal proof methods (by simp auto) at the end of each case, as the proof is already complete without them.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is correct and has successfully proven the theorem. The error message indicates that there are no subgoals left when the terminal proof method is applied, which means the proof is already complete at that point.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. Remove the terminal proof methods (by simp auto) at the end of each case in both directions of the bi-implication.\n2. Simply use 'show ?thesis' instead of 'show ?thesis by simp auto' in each case.\n3. The proof should now successfully terminate without any errors.\n\nThese changes will streamline the proof and remove the unnecessary application of terminal proof methods when the subgoals are already solved. The resulting proof will be more concise and efficient, while still rigorously demonstrating the theorem.",
