    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and the planning strategy, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. The theorem is an implication, so we should start by introducing the antecedent as an assumption. This will allow us to work with the left-hand side of the implication to prove the right-hand side.\n\n2. The antecedent is a conjunction of two bi-implications. We'll need to break this down into separate assumptions that we can use later in the proof.\n\n3. The consequent is a bi-implication, which means we'll need to prove both directions. We should structure our proof to handle each direction separately.\n\n4. For each direction of the bi-implication in the consequent, we'll need to use case analysis on the disjunctions (P1 ∨ Q1) and (P2 ∨ Q2).\n\n5. In each case of the analysis, we'll use the corresponding bi-implication from our assumptions to show that the other disjunction holds.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by:\n\n1. Using the 'intro' method to introduce the antecedent as an assumption.\n2. Applying 'conjE' to break down the conjunction in the antecedent into separate assumptions.\n3. Preparing to prove the bi-implication in the consequent by setting up a proof for both directions.\n\nThe first concrete step should be to apply the 'intro' method to begin the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt timed out, likely due to excessive complexity or inefficient structure in the proving process.\n\nImprovement: Simplify the proof structure by using more direct methods and leveraging built-in Isabelle tactics to handle common logical operations more efficiently.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The current proof attempt, while logically sound, appears to be overly verbose and complex. This complexity likely led to the timeout error.\n\n2. The proof structure involves multiple nested proofs and assumes, which may be contributing to the performance issues.\n\n3. Isabelle has built-in tactics that can handle many of the logical operations we're performing manually, which could significantly streamline the proof.\n\n4. We should consider using more powerful tactics like `auto`, `simp`, or `blast` to handle some of the logical reasoning automatically.\n\n5. The bi-implication in the conclusion could potentially be proved more directly using Isabelle's simplification and automation tools.\n\nFor the next attempt, we should:\n\n1. Start with a simpler proof structure, possibly using a single `proof` block instead of multiple nested ones.\n\n2. Utilize Isabelle's automated reasoning tactics more extensively, especially for handling the logical equivalences and disjunctions.\n\n3. Consider breaking down the proof into smaller lemmas if the main proof remains too complex for automated tactics to handle entirely.\n\n4. Focus on leveraging Isabelle's built-in simplification rules and rewrite rules for handling bi-implications and disjunctions.\n\n5. If manual proof steps are still necessary, try to minimize their complexity and use more direct logical inferences where possible.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we aim to create a more efficient and concise proof that Isabelle can process within the time constraints.",
