Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start by introducing the universal quantifier in the conclusion.\n   b. Use the given assumptions to prove the conclusion for an arbitrary value.\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Begin the proof\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary value for the universal quantifier\n   c. Apply the first assumption to obtain the implication for the arbitrary value\n   d. Apply the second assumption to obtain P for the arbitrary value\n   e. Use modus ponens (MP) to conclude Q for the arbitrary value\n   f. Close the proof\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - proof\n   - fix\n   - have\n   - thus\n   - qed\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - Be mindful of the order of applying assumptions\n   - Ensure proper instantiation of the universal quantifiers\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all assumptions are used\n   - Check that the conclusion matches the theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully started the proof and introduced an arbitrary value 'x' using the 'fix' command. Now, we need to apply our assumptions to this arbitrary value and use logical deduction to prove Q x. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should first apply the second assumption \"\\<forall>a. P a\" to our fixed 'x'. This will give us \"P x\".\n\n2. Then, we should apply the first assumption \"\\<forall>a. P a \\<longrightarrow> Q a\" to 'x'. This will give us \"P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x\".\n\n3. Now that we have both \"P x\" and \"P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x\", we can use modus ponens to deduce \"Q x\".\n\n4. Since we've proven Q x for an arbitrary x, we've effectively shown \"\\<forall>a. Q a\", which is our goal.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these logical steps using appropriate Isabelle tactics, such as 'have' statements to introduce intermediate facts, and 'thus' to state the final conclusion. The database error mentioned in the observation should be ignored as it's not relevant to the logical structure of our proof.\n",
