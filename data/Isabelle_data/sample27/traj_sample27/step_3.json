    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem structure:\n   - We have a theorem named \"or_example\" with three assumptions (H1, H2, H3) and one conclusion.\n   - The goal is to prove R given the assumptions.\n\n2. Identify the key elements:\n   - H1: P implies R\n   - H2: Q implies R\n   - H3: P or Q is true\n   - Goal: R\n\n3. Develop the proof strategy:\n   a. Use a proof by cases based on the disjunction in H3 (P or Q).\n   b. For each case:\n      - If P is true, use H1 to conclude R.\n      - If Q is true, use H2 to conclude R.\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof -\" to begin the proof.\n   b. Use \"from H3 show ?thesis\" to focus on the disjunction.\n   c. Apply the \"cases\" method to split into two cases: P and Q.\n   d. For the P case:\n      - Use assumption H1 to derive R.\n   e. For the Q case:\n      - Use assumption H2 to derive R.\n   f. Conclude the proof with \"qed\".\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - Be prepared to use basic logical reasoning methods like \"intro\", \"elim\", and \"simp\".\n   - The proof may require using the implication elimination rule with the assumptions H1 and H2.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all assumptions are used and the goal R is properly derived in both cases.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, here's my reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Environment Issue: The error message indicates a problem with the Isabelle environment, specifically with database permissions or file location. This is not a logical error in our proof, but an external issue.\n\n2. Proof Structure: The current proof structure appears to be correct and follows the planned strategy. It uses a proof by cases based on the disjunction in H3, and correctly applies H1 and H2 in the respective cases.\n\n3. Next Steps:\n   a. First, the acting agent should focus on resolving the Isabelle environment issue. This may involve:\n      - Checking and adjusting file permissions for the Isabelle database.\n      - Verifying the database file location and ensuring it's accessible.\n      - Restarting the Isabelle environment if necessary.\n\n   b. Once the environment issue is resolved, the acting agent should attempt to run the existing proof again without changes. The current proof structure is logically sound and should work once the external issues are addressed.\n\n   c. If the proof runs successfully after fixing the environment, no further changes to the proof itself are necessary.\n\n   d. In case of persistent issues after resolving the environment problem, only then should we consider reviewing and potentially adjusting the proof structure.\n\n4. Verification: After resolving the environment issue and rerunning the proof, the acting agent should carefully observe the output to ensure that the proof is accepted by Isabelle and that the lemma is successfully proved.\n\n5. Contingency: If unexpected issues arise after addressing the environment problem, the acting agent should report back for further guidance on potential logical adjustments to the proof.\n\nThe key focus for the next action should be on resolving the Isabelle environment issue and then rerunning the existing proof without modifications.\n",
