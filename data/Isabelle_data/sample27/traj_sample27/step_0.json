Analyze the problem structure:\n   - We have a theorem named \"or_example\" with three assumptions (H1, H2, H3) and one conclusion.\n   - The goal is to prove R given the assumptions.\n\n2. Identify the key elements:\n   - H1: P implies R\n   - H2: Q implies R\n   - H3: P or Q is true\n   - Goal: R\n\n3. Develop the proof strategy:\n   a. Use a proof by cases based on the disjunction in H3 (P or Q).\n   b. For each case:\n      - If P is true, use H1 to conclude R.\n      - If Q is true, use H2 to conclude R.\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof -\" to begin the proof.\n   b. Use \"from H3 show ?thesis\" to focus on the disjunction.\n   c. Apply the \"cases\" method to split into two cases: P and Q.\n   d. For the P case:\n      - Use assumption H1 to derive R.\n   e. For the Q case:\n      - Use assumption H2 to derive R.\n   f. Conclude the proof with \"qed\".\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - Be prepared to use basic logical reasoning methods like \"intro\", \"elim\", and \"simp\".\n   - The proof may require using the implication elimination rule with the assumptions H1 and H2.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all assumptions are used and the goal R is properly derived in both cases.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the \"or_example\" theorem, we should follow the planned strategy of using a proof by cases. Given that we have no historical actions and are starting from scratch, our first step should be to set up the proof structure.\n\n1. We should start by using the \"proof -\" command to begin the proof without any initial assumptions.\n\n2. Next, we need to focus on the disjunction in assumption H3 (P âˆ¨ Q). We can do this by using the command \"from H3 show ?thesis\".\n\n3. After that, we should apply the \"cases\" method to split the proof into two cases: one for P and one for Q. This can be done using the command \"proof cases\".\n\nThese initial steps will set up the structure for our proof by cases, allowing us to then handle each case separately using assumptions H1 and H2. This approach directly follows our planned strategy and sets the stage for the subsequent steps in the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these initial commands to start the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof incorrectly assumes that 'P' and 'Q' are facts that can be directly referenced, when they are actually part of the disjunction in assumption H3.\n\nImprovement: Modify the proof structure to properly handle the cases from the disjunction in H3, using 'case' instead of 'assume' for each branch of the proof.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt is on the right track with using a proof by cases, but it makes an incorrect assumption about how to reference the cases. In Isabelle, when using the 'cases' method on a disjunction, we need to use 'case' to refer to each part of the disjunction, rather than 'assume'.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Keep the overall structure of the proof, including the initial 'proof -' and 'from H3 show ?thesis'.\n\n2. Replace 'assume P' with 'case P' in the first case.\n\n3. Replace 'assume Q' with 'case Q' in the second case.\n\n4. Ensure that we're using the case hypotheses correctly in each branch of the proof.\n\nThese changes will allow us to properly reference the cases from the disjunction in H3 and should resolve the \"Undefined fact\" error we encountered. The acting agent should implement these modifications in the next attempt at the proof.",
