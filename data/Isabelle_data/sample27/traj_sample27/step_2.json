    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem structure:\n   - We have a theorem named \"or_example\" with three assumptions (H1, H2, H3) and one conclusion.\n   - The goal is to prove R given the assumptions.\n\n2. Identify the key elements:\n   - H1: P implies R\n   - H2: Q implies R\n   - H3: P or Q is true\n   - Goal: R\n\n3. Develop the proof strategy:\n   a. Use a proof by cases based on the disjunction in H3 (P or Q).\n   b. For each case:\n      - If P is true, use H1 to conclude R.\n      - If Q is true, use H2 to conclude R.\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof -\" to begin the proof.\n   b. Use \"from H3 show ?thesis\" to focus on the disjunction.\n   c. Apply the \"cases\" method to split into two cases: P and Q.\n   d. For the P case:\n      - Use assumption H1 to derive R.\n   e. For the Q case:\n      - Use assumption H2 to derive R.\n   f. Conclude the proof with \"qed\".\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - Be prepared to use basic logical reasoning methods like \"intro\", \"elim\", and \"simp\".\n   - The proof may require using the implication elimination rule with the assumptions H1 and H2.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all assumptions are used and the goal R is properly derived in both cases.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure is correct, but we need to adjust the way we introduce the cases for the disjunction. Instead of using 'case P' and 'case Q', we should use 'assume P' and 'assume Q' respectively. This change will resolve the \"Undefined case\" error and allow us to properly handle the disjunction in H3.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Keep the overall structure of the proof, including the 'proof -' and 'from H3 show ?thesis proof cases' parts.\n\n2. For the first case:\n   - Use 'assume P' to introduce the assumption that P is true.\n   - Directly apply H1 (P → R) to this assumption to conclude R.\n\n3. For the second case:\n   - Use 'assume Q' to introduce the assumption that Q is true.\n   - Directly apply H2 (Q → R) to this assumption to conclude R.\n\n4. Remove the redundant lines that were restating P and Q, as they are not necessary.\n\n5. Use the 'with' keyword to combine the assumption (P or Q) with the corresponding implication (H1 or H2) to derive R in each case.\n\nThis approach will correctly handle the disjunction in H3 and use the implications given in H1 and H2 to prove R in both cases, completing the proof of the or_example lemma.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but there seems to be an issue with the Isabelle environment or database, preventing the proof from being processed.\nImprovement: We need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and has write permissions, then rerun the proof with the current correct structure.\n```\n\nBased on the current observation, it appears that the proof structure itself is not the issue. The error message suggests a problem with the Isabelle environment, specifically with the database file being read-only or moved. This is likely an external issue rather than a problem with our proof logic.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. We should first verify that the Isabelle environment is correctly set up and has the necessary permissions to write to its database.\n\n2. Once the environment issue is resolved, we should attempt to run the proof again with the current structure, as it appears to be correct.\n\n3. If the proof runs successfully after fixing the environment, we can consider this lemma proved.\n\n4. If there are still issues after resolving the environment problem, we may need to review the proof structure again, but based on our current knowledge, the proof looks correct and should work once the external issues are addressed.\n\n5. It might be helpful to run a simple test proof to ensure that the Isabelle environment is functioning correctly before attempting this proof again.\n\nThe key here is to focus on resolving the external Isabelle environment issue before making any changes to the proof itself, as the current proof structure seems to be on the right track.",
