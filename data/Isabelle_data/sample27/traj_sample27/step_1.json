    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem structure:\n   - We have a theorem named \"or_example\" with three assumptions (H1, H2, H3) and one conclusion.\n   - The goal is to prove R given the assumptions.\n\n2. Identify the key elements:\n   - H1: P implies R\n   - H2: Q implies R\n   - H3: P or Q is true\n   - Goal: R\n\n3. Develop the proof strategy:\n   a. Use a proof by cases based on the disjunction in H3 (P or Q).\n   b. For each case:\n      - If P is true, use H1 to conclude R.\n      - If Q is true, use H2 to conclude R.\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with \"proof -\" to begin the proof.\n   b. Use \"from H3 show ?thesis\" to focus on the disjunction.\n   c. Apply the \"cases\" method to split into two cases: P and Q.\n   d. For the P case:\n      - Use assumption H1 to derive R.\n   e. For the Q case:\n      - Use assumption H2 to derive R.\n   f. Conclude the proof with \"qed\".\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - Be prepared to use basic logical reasoning methods like \"intro\", \"elim\", and \"simp\".\n   - The proof may require using the implication elimination rule with the assumptions H1 and H2.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all assumptions are used and the goal R is properly derived in both cases.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure is correct, but we need to adjust how we handle the cases from the disjunction in H3. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Keep the initial part of the proof unchanged:\n   proof -\n   from H3 show ?thesis\n\n2. Maintain the 'proof cases' structure, as it's the correct approach for handling the disjunction.\n\n3. For the first case:\n   - Replace 'assume P' with 'case P'\n   - Use 'then' to refer to the case hypothesis (P)\n   - Combine this with H1 to derive R\n\n4. For the second case:\n   - Replace 'assume Q' with 'case Q'\n   - Use 'then' to refer to the case hypothesis (Q)\n   - Combine this with H2 to derive R\n\n5. Keep the 'qed' at the end to close the proof.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we'll properly handle the cases from the disjunction in H3 and resolve the \"Undefined fact\" error. The 'case' keyword will introduce the appropriate local assumptions for each branch of the proof, allowing us to use them in conjunction with H1 and H2 to prove R in each case.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the use of 'case P' and 'case Q' is causing an \"Undefined case\" error because these cases were not properly defined.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'case P' and 'case Q' with 'assume P' and 'assume Q' respectively, as these are the correct keywords for introducing assumptions in a proof by cases for a disjunction.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is on the right track, but there's a misuse of the 'case' keyword. In Isabelle, 'case' is typically used with inductive definitions or when using the 'cases' method, which isn't applicable here. For a simple disjunction like \"P âˆ¨ Q\", we should use 'assume' to introduce the cases.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. Keep the overall structure of the proof, including the 'proof cases' part.\n2. Replace 'case P' with 'assume P' in the first case.\n3. Replace 'case Q' with 'assume Q' in the second case.\n4. Remove the redundant 'then have \"P\" by simp' and 'then have \"Q\" by simp' lines, as they're not necessary.\n5. Use the assumptions directly with H1 and H2 to derive R in each case.\n\nThese changes should resolve the \"Undefined case\" error and allow the proof to proceed correctly. The proof will then properly handle the disjunction in H3 and use the implications given in H1 and H2 to prove R in each case.",
