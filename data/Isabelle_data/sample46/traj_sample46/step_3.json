    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with a binary tree datatype and a tree reversal function.\n   - Note that tree_example0 is a simple tree with one root node and two leaf children.\n\n2. Expand Definitions:\n   - Start by expanding the definition of tree_example0.\n   - Then, expand the definition of tree_reverse applied to tree_example0.\n\n3. Simplify Expressions:\n   - After expanding definitions, simplify the resulting expressions step by step.\n   - This will involve applying the tree_reverse function rules to the expanded tree_example0.\n\n4. Compare Results:\n   - After simplification, compare the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.\n   - They should be identical if the lemma holds true.\n\n5. Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the 'auto' tactic as a starting point, as it can often solve simple equalities automatically.\n   - If 'auto' doesn't succeed, proceed with manual steps:\n     a. Use 'simp' tactic with the tree_example0_def to expand the definition.\n     b. Apply the tree_reverse.simps rules to simplify the tree_reverse application.\n\n6. Finalize Proof:\n   - Once the expressions on both sides are identical, use 'reflexivity' or 'simp' to conclude the proof.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Double-check that all steps are logically sound and that no assumptions were made.\n   - Ensure that the proof is complete and Isabelle accepts it without any remaining goals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The primary issue is the incorrect syntax in the tree_reverse function definition. We need to replace \"â‡’\" with \"=>\" to correctly specify the function type in Isabelle/HOL.\n\n2. Theory File Review:\n   After correcting the syntax error, we should review the entire theory file to ensure there are no other syntax issues or inconsistencies.\n\n3. Proof Verification:\n   Once the syntax is corrected and the theory processes without errors, we can proceed to verify the existing proof steps for the lemma tree_example0_tree_reverse.\n\n4. Proof Strategy Confirmation:\n   Confirm that the current proof strategy, which expands definitions and simplifies expressions step by step, is still valid and optimal for proving the lemma.\n\n5. Next Actions:\n   a. Instruct the acting agent to correct the syntax in the tree_reverse function definition.\n   b. After correction, attempt to process the entire theory file to ensure it's free of errors.\n   c. If successful, proceed with verifying each step of the existing proof.\n   d. If any issues arise in the proof, be prepared to adjust the proof strategy accordingly.\n\nBy following these steps, we can resolve the immediate syntax issue and move forward with proving the lemma, ensuring a solid foundation for our reasoning process.\n",
