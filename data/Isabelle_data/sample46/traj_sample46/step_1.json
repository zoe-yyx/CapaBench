    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with a binary tree datatype and a tree reversal function.\n   - Note that tree_example0 is a simple tree with one root node and two leaf children.\n\n2. Expand Definitions:\n   - Start by expanding the definition of tree_example0.\n   - Then, expand the definition of tree_reverse applied to tree_example0.\n\n3. Simplify Expressions:\n   - After expanding definitions, simplify the resulting expressions step by step.\n   - This will involve applying the tree_reverse function rules to the expanded tree_example0.\n\n4. Compare Results:\n   - After simplification, compare the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.\n   - They should be identical if the lemma holds true.\n\n5. Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the 'auto' tactic as a starting point, as it can often solve simple equalities automatically.\n   - If 'auto' doesn't succeed, proceed with manual steps:\n     a. Use 'simp' tactic with the tree_example0_def to expand the definition.\n     b. Apply the tree_reverse.simps rules to simplify the tree_reverse application.\n\n6. Finalize Proof:\n   - Once the expressions on both sides are identical, use 'reflexivity' or 'simp' to conclude the proof.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Double-check that all steps are logically sound and that no assumptions were made.\n   - Ensure that the proof is complete and Isabelle accepts it without any remaining goals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a syntax error in the definition of the tree_reverse function. This error is preventing the theory from being processed, which in turn is blocking our ability to prove the lemma. To address this and move forward with the proof, we should:\n\n1. Modify the tree_reverse function definition:\n   Change the line:\n   \"fun tree_reverse :: \"tree ⇒ tree\" where\"\n   to:\n   \"fun tree_reverse :: \"tree -> tree\" where\"\n\n2. After making this change, we should be able to process the theory without lexical errors.\n\n3. Once the syntax error is resolved, we can proceed with the proof as originally planned. The current proof structure appears to be correct and follows a logical sequence:\n   - It expands the definition of tree_example0\n   - Applies the tree_reverse function\n   - Simplifies the expressions\n   - Shows that the result is equal to the original tree_example0\n\n4. The proof steps use appropriate tactics:\n   - 'simp add: tree_example0_def' to expand the definition\n   - 'simp' to apply simplification rules, including those for tree_reverse\n   - The 'also' and 'finally' proof structure to chain equalities\n\n5. If the proof processes without errors after fixing the syntax, it should be complete and correct.\n\nTherefore, the next step for the acting agent should be to modify the function definition as described above and then attempt to process the entire theory and proof again. If successful, we can then verify that the proof is complete and accepted by Isabelle.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists in the function definition of tree_reverse, using \"->\" instead of \"⇒\" for the function type.\n\nImprovement: Replace \"tree -> tree\" with \"tree ⇒ tree\" in the tree_reverse function definition to correctly specify the function type in Isabelle syntax.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that despite the previous attempt to fix the syntax error, we've inadvertently introduced a different but related error. In Isabelle, function types are specified using the \"⇒\" symbol, not the \"->\" commonly used in other programming languages.\n\nTo improve our next steps:\n\n1. We need to carefully review and apply Isabelle-specific syntax, especially for type declarations.\n2. When making changes, we should verify that we're using Isabelle's correct symbols and not substituting with similar-looking alternatives from other languages.\n3. After making the correction, we should process the entire theory again to ensure no other syntax errors remain.\n4. Once the syntax is correct, we can proceed with evaluating the proof structure and content.\n\nThis reflection emphasizes the importance of precision in syntax when working with formal proof assistants like Isabelle. It also suggests that we might benefit from a quick review of Isabelle's basic syntax rules before proceeding further, to avoid similar issues in the future.",
