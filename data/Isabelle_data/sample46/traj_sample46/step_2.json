    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with a binary tree datatype and a tree reversal function.\n   - Note that tree_example0 is a simple tree with one root node and two leaf children.\n\n2. Expand Definitions:\n   - Start by expanding the definition of tree_example0.\n   - Then, expand the definition of tree_reverse applied to tree_example0.\n\n3. Simplify Expressions:\n   - After expanding definitions, simplify the resulting expressions step by step.\n   - This will involve applying the tree_reverse function rules to the expanded tree_example0.\n\n4. Compare Results:\n   - After simplification, compare the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.\n   - They should be identical if the lemma holds true.\n\n5. Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the 'auto' tactic as a starting point, as it can often solve simple equalities automatically.\n   - If 'auto' doesn't succeed, proceed with manual steps:\n     a. Use 'simp' tactic with the tree_example0_def to expand the definition.\n     b. Apply the tree_reverse.simps rules to simplify the tree_reverse application.\n\n6. Finalize Proof:\n   - Once the expressions on both sides are identical, use 'reflexivity' or 'simp' to conclude the proof.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Double-check that all steps are logically sound and that no assumptions were made.\n   - Ensure that the proof is complete and Isabelle accepts it without any remaining goals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we need to address is the syntax error in the tree_reverse function definition. This error is preventing the theory from being processed, which is a prerequisite for proving the lemma. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. Correct the syntax: We need to replace \"tree -> tree\" with \"tree ⇒ tree\" in the tree_reverse function definition. This is the correct way to specify function types in Isabelle.\n\n2. Verify the correction: After making this change, we should reprocess the entire theory to ensure that this was the only syntax error and that the rest of the theory is now accepted by Isabelle.\n\n3. Proceed with the proof: Assuming the syntax error is resolved, we can then focus on the actual proof of the lemma tree_example0_tree_reverse.\n\n4. Review the proof structure: The existing proof structure seems logical and follows our initial plan. It expands the definition of tree_example0, applies tree_reverse, and then simplifies the result step by step.\n\n5. Verify each step: Once we can see the processed proof, we should verify that each step is correctly recognized by Isabelle and that there are no remaining proof obligations.\n\n6. Consider automation: If the manual proof steps are all recognized, we might consider whether the proof can be simplified or automated using tactics like 'auto' or 'simp'.\n\nThe key point is to resolve the syntax error first, as this is blocking our ability to proceed with the actual proof. Once resolved, we can focus on ensuring the proof itself is correct and complete.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists in the tree_reverse function definition, using \"⇒\" instead of \"=>\".\n\nImprovement: Replace \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in the tree_reverse function definition to correctly specify the function type in Isabelle/HOL syntax.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that despite our previous attempt to correct the syntax, we inadvertently introduced a different, but still incorrect, symbol for the function arrow. This oversight is preventing the theory from being processed, which in turn blocks our ability to prove the lemma.\n\nTo improve our approach in the next steps:\n\n1. We need to be more careful in our syntax corrections, ensuring we use the correct Isabelle/HOL symbols. The correct symbol for function types in Isabelle/HOL is \"=>\", not \"⇒\" or \"->\".\n\n2. After making the correction, we should verify the entire theory file to ensure there are no other syntax errors or issues.\n\n3. Once the syntax is correct and the theory processes without errors, we can proceed with verifying the proof steps for the lemma.\n\n4. We should also consider setting up a proper Isabelle environment or using an Isabelle-aware editor to catch these syntax errors earlier in the process.\n\n5. In future iterations, we might want to implement a quick syntax check step before proceeding with more complex reasoning about the proof structure.\n\nBy addressing these points, we can avoid similar syntax errors in the future and focus more effectively on the actual proof content and structure. This will lead to more efficient problem-solving and proof development in subsequent rounds.",
