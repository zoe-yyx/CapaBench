    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with a binary tree datatype and a tree reversal function.\n   - Note that tree_example0 is a simple tree with one root node and two leaf children.\n\n2. Expand Definitions:\n   - Start by expanding the definition of tree_example0.\n   - Then, expand the definition of tree_reverse applied to tree_example0.\n\n3. Simplify Expressions:\n   - After expanding definitions, simplify the resulting expressions step by step.\n   - This will involve applying the tree_reverse function rules to the expanded tree_example0.\n\n4. Compare Results:\n   - After simplification, compare the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.\n   - They should be identical if the lemma holds true.\n\n5. Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the 'auto' tactic as a starting point, as it can often solve simple equalities automatically.\n   - If 'auto' doesn't succeed, proceed with manual steps:\n     a. Use 'simp' tactic with the tree_example0_def to expand the definition.\n     b. Apply the tree_reverse.simps rules to simplify the tree_reverse application.\n\n6. Finalize Proof:\n   - Once the expressions on both sides are identical, use 'reflexivity' or 'simp' to conclude the proof.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Double-check that all steps are logically sound and that no assumptions were made.\n   - Ensure that the proof is complete and Isabelle accepts it without any remaining goals.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the lemma tree_example0_tree_reverse, our first step should be to expand the definitions involved. This aligns with steps 2 and 3 of our planning strategy.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to start by expanding the definition of tree_example0. This will give us a concrete tree structure to work with.\n2. After expanding tree_example0, we should apply the tree_reverse function to this expanded form.\n3. The tree_reverse function will then be simplified based on its definition rules.\n4. Once we have both sides of the equation expanded and simplified, we can compare them to see if they are indeed equal.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I recommend that the acting agent starts by using the 'simp' tactic with the tree_example0_def to expand the definition of tree_example0. This will set the stage for further simplification and application of the tree_reverse function.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The error indicates a lexical issue with the arrow symbol (⇒) in the type definition of the tree_reverse function.\n\nImprovement: Replace the unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (->) in the function definition to ensure compatibility and correct parsing.\n```\n\nThis reflection is based on the following analysis:\n\n1. The error message points to a lexical error at line 10, specifically at \"⇒ tree\" in the function definition.\n\n2. The use of unicode symbols like \"⇒\" can sometimes cause parsing issues in Isabelle/HOL, especially if the environment is not properly configured to handle unicode characters.\n\n3. The error prevented the theory from being processed further, which is why we didn't see any output related to the actual proof attempt.\n\n4. To improve the situation, we should use the ASCII equivalent \"->\" instead of \"⇒\" in the function definition. This is a common practice to avoid potential unicode-related issues.\n\n5. Once this syntax error is corrected, we should be able to proceed with the proof as planned. The current proof structure appears to be correct and follows the reasoning steps we outlined earlier.\n\nFor the next steps, I recommend:\n\n1. Modify the tree_reverse function definition to use \"->\" instead of \"⇒\".\n2. After making this change, attempt to run the proof again.\n3. If successful, we can then focus on the actual proof steps and ensure they are correct and complete.\n\nThis adjustment should allow the theory to be parsed correctly, enabling us to move forward with the actual proof of the lemma.",
