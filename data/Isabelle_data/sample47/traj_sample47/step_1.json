    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem is named \"dist_exists_and\"\n   - We need to prove: \"(\\<exists>x. P x) \\<and> (\\<exists>x. Q x)\"\n   - Given assumption: \"\\<exists>x. P x \\<and> Q x\"\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'proof' command to start the proof\n   - Utilize the given assumption\n   - Break down the goal into two parts: (\\<exists>x. P x) and (\\<exists>x. Q x)\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   a) Start with the assumption:\n      - Use 'obtain' to extract the witness from the existential quantifier\n   \n   b) Prove the left conjunct (\\<exists>x. P x):\n      - Use the witness obtained from the assumption\n      - Apply the existential introduction rule\n   \n   c) Prove the right conjunct (\\<exists>x. Q x):\n      - Use the same witness as before\n      - Apply the existential introduction rule again\n   \n   d) Combine the two parts:\n      - Use the conjunction introduction rule\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use 'qed' to finish the proof\n\n5. Potential tactics to use:\n   - obtain\n   - rule\n   - exI (existential introduction)\n   - conjI (conjunction introduction)\n\n6. Key points to remember:\n   - The same witness satisfies both P and Q\n   - We need to introduce the existential quantifier twice, once for P and once for Q\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We have successfully obtained the witness 'a' that satisfies both P and Q from the assumption. This is a good starting point.\n\n2. Now, we need to prove both parts of the conjunction separately using this witness. We'll use the existential introduction rule (exI) for each part.\n\n3. For the left part of the conjunction:\n   - We need to prove \"\\<exists>x. P x\"\n   - We can use the witness 'a' and the fact that \"P a\" is true (from the assumption)\n   - Apply the existential introduction rule\n\n4. For the right part of the conjunction:\n   - We need to prove \"\\<exists>x. Q x\"\n   - We can use the same witness 'a' and the fact that \"Q a\" is true (also from the assumption)\n   - Apply the existential introduction rule again\n\n5. After proving both parts, we can combine them using the conjunction introduction rule (conjI) to prove the final theorem.\n\n6. The proof should be structured using 'have' statements for each part, followed by a 'show' statement to conclude the proof.\n\nThis approach will allow us to complete the proof rigorously without using 'sorry', demonstrating each step explicitly and using the appropriate introduction rules.\n",
