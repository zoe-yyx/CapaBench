    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem involves universal quantification and bi-implication (iff).\n   - We need to prove that if P x and Q x are equivalent for all x, then the universal quantification of P is equivalent to the universal quantification of Q.\n\n2. Outline the Proof Structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to split the bi-implication into two implications.\n   - For each direction, we'll need to prove:\n     a) (\\<forall>x. P x) \\<Longrightarrow> (\\<forall>x. Q x)\n     b) (\\<forall>x. Q x) \\<Longrightarrow> (\\<forall>x. P x)\n\n3. Prove the First Direction:\n   - Assume (\\<forall>x. P x)\n   - Show that this implies (\\<forall>x. Q x)\n   - Use the assumption \"\\<forall>x. P x \\<longleftrightarrow> Q x\" to connect P and Q\n\n4. Prove the Second Direction:\n   - Assume (\\<forall>x. Q x)\n   - Show that this implies (\\<forall>x. P x)\n   - Again, use the assumption \"\\<forall>x. P x \\<longleftrightarrow> Q x\" to connect Q and P\n\n5. Key Strategies:\n   - Use 'rule allI' to introduce universal quantifiers when needed\n   - Use 'rule spec' to instantiate universal quantifiers\n   - Apply the assumption using 'assumption' or by referring to it explicitly\n\n6. Finishing Up:\n   - Ensure all goals are discharged\n   - Use 'done' to complete the proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current error is due to a lexical issue with the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" in the type declaration. To resolve this, we need to modify the theorem statement and any occurrences of this symbol in the proof. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Replace all instances of \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in the theorem statement and throughout the proof.\n2. Specifically, change \"'a ⇒ bool\" to \"'a => bool\" in the type declaration for P and Q.\n3. Review the entire proof to ensure consistency in symbol usage, replacing any other Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents if necessary.\n4. After making these changes, re-run the entire proof.\n5. If the lexical error is resolved, the proof should proceed without issues, as the logical structure appears to be correct.\n6. Pay attention to any new error messages that might appear after this change, as they could reveal any remaining issues in the proof structure or syntax.\n\nThe goal is to maintain the logical integrity of the proof while adapting it to Isabelle's parsing requirements. Once these syntax issues are resolved, we can focus on verifying the correctness of the proof steps if any further adjustments are needed.\n",
