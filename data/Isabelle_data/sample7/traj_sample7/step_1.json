    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The problem involves a custom datatype 'tree' and a function 'tree_height'.\n   - The target theorem is 'Leaf_height', which states that the height of a Leaf is 0.\n\n2. Understand the Definitions:\n   - Review the datatype 'tree' definition: it can be either a Leaf or a Node.\n   - Examine the 'tree_height' function definition, especially the base case for Leaf.\n\n3. Identify the Proof Strategy:\n   - This is a simple case that directly follows from the function definition.\n   - The proof should be straightforward using the function's equation for Leaf.\n\n4. Outline the Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof.\n   b. Use the definition of 'tree_height' for the Leaf case.\n   c. Simplify the resulting equation.\n   d. Conclude the proof.\n\n5. Consider Potential Tactics:\n   - 'simp' tactic might be sufficient to prove this lemma automatically.\n   - If 'simp' doesn't work, consider using 'unfold' to expand the definition of 'tree_height'.\n\n6. Prepare for Potential Challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to break it down into smaller steps if needed.\n\n7. Plan for Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that Isabelle accepts it without any errors or warnings.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a syntax error in the function definition, not a problem with the proof itself. To proceed with the proof, we need to:\n\n1. Modify the function definition of tree_height to use the ASCII arrow \"=>\" instead of the Unicode arrow \"â‡’\".\n2. After fixing this syntax issue, we can proceed with the original proof strategy.\n\nThe reasoning for the proof itself remains unchanged:\n\n1. The lemma Leaf_height: \"tree_height Leaf = 0\" directly follows from the definition of the tree_height function.\n2. The first equation of tree_height explicitly states that \"tree_height Leaf = 0\".\n3. Therefore, the 'simp' tactic should be sufficient to prove this lemma automatically by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation to match the right-hand side.\n\nOnce the syntax error is corrected, the proof should proceed smoothly with the 'by simp' tactic. If for any reason 'simp' doesn't work, we may need to consider more explicit steps such as:\n\n1. Unfolding the definition of tree_height\n2. Rewriting with the specific equation for the Leaf case\n3. Simplifying the resulting expression\n\nHowever, given the simplicity of this lemma, the 'simp' tactic should be adequate once the syntax is corrected.\n",
