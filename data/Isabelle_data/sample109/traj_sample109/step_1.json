    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\"\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure and logical reasoning for the theorem \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\" appear to be correct and well-formulated. The error encountered is not related to the proof itself but to a database constraint in the Isabelle environment.\n\nGiven this, the reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. Maintain the current proof structure as it aligns well with the problem requirements and logical flow.\n\n2. The acting agent should attempt to resubmit the proof without any changes to the logical content. This will help determine if the error was a temporary glitch in the Isabelle environment.\n\n3. If the error persists, the acting agent should focus on troubleshooting the Isabelle environment, particularly the SQLite database that's causing the constraint violation. This may involve:\n   a. Checking the Isabelle session configuration\n   b. Verifying the integrity of the Isabelle database\n   c. Ensuring there are no conflicting session names or duplicate entries\n\n4. In parallel, to preserve the logical work done so far, the acting agent should consider:\n   a. Saving the current proof as a separate file or comment\n   b. Attempting to run the proof in a different Isabelle instance or environment to isolate the issue\n\n5. If environmental issues persist, the acting agent should seek assistance from the Isabelle system administrators or support team to resolve the database constraint error.\n\nThe key point is to maintain the current proof structure while addressing the technical constraint. The logical approach to proving the theorem remains sound, and efforts should be focused on resolving the environmental issue to allow for successful proof submission and verification.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error is not in the proof itself, but in the Isabelle environment, specifically a SQLite database constraint violation.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the database issue by checking the Isabelle session configuration, verifying database integrity, and ensuring no conflicting session names exist, while preserving the current proof structure.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the current proof structure and logical reasoning are sound, but an external factor is preventing successful execution. The primary issue lies in the Isabelle environment, specifically with the SQLite database used by Isabelle.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. The acting agent should first attempt to rerun the proof without changes to rule out temporary glitches.\n\n2. If the error persists, investigate the Isabelle environment:\n   - Check the Isabelle session configuration for any anomalies.\n   - Verify the integrity of the Isabelle SQLite database.\n   - Ensure there are no duplicate or conflicting session names in the project.\n\n3. Consider running the proof in a different Isabelle instance or environment to isolate the issue.\n\n4. If the problem continues, seek assistance from Isabelle system administrators or support to resolve the database constraint error.\n\n5. While troubleshooting, preserve the current proof by saving it separately or as a comment to avoid losing progress.\n\nThe key is to maintain the logical structure of the proof while addressing the technical constraint. This approach ensures that once the environmental issue is resolved, the proof can be immediately verified without needing further logical modifications.",
