    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\"\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. The proof structure and logical reasoning appear to be correct and complete. The error message indicates an issue with the Isabelle environment, specifically a SQLite database constraint violation, rather than a problem with the proof itself.\n\n2. The primary focus should be on resolving the database issue while preserving the current proof. This approach ensures that once the technical problem is addressed, the proof can be immediately verified without needing logical modifications.\n\n3. To proceed effectively:\n\n   a) First, attempt to rerun the proof without any changes. This will help determine if the error is persistent or was a temporary glitch.\n\n   b) If the error persists, investigate the Isabelle environment:\n      - Check the Isabelle session configuration for any anomalies.\n      - Verify the integrity of the Isabelle SQLite database.\n      - Ensure there are no duplicate or conflicting session names in the project.\n\n   c) Consider running the proof in a different Isabelle instance or environment to isolate the issue and determine if it's specific to the current setup.\n\n   d) If the problem continues, it may be necessary to seek assistance from Isabelle system administrators or support to resolve the database constraint error.\n\n4. While troubleshooting, it's crucial to preserve the current proof. Save it separately or as a comment to avoid losing progress.\n\n5. Once the environmental issue is resolved, the acting agent should rerun the proof as it stands, as the logical structure appears sound and complete.\n\nThis reasoning emphasizes addressing the technical constraint while maintaining the integrity of the proof, ensuring that the proof can be verified as soon as the database issue is resolved.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails due to a lexical error in the type declaration, specifically with the use of Unicode arrow characters (⇒) which are not properly recognized.\nImprovement: Replace all instances of the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) throughout the theory file to ensure proper parsing of type declarations.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the issue is not with the logical structure of the proof, but rather with the syntax used in the type declarations. The Unicode arrow character (⇒) is causing parsing issues in Isabelle. To resolve this, we need to modify our approach:\n\n1. Go through the entire theory file and replace all instances of ⇒ with =>.\n2. This includes the definitions of mono, shift_left1, and preserved_by_shifting_left.\n3. Ensure that other Unicode characters like ≡ (equivalence) and ⟶ (implication) are also replaced with their ASCII equivalents if necessary.\n4. After making these replacements, rerun the proof to see if the lexical error is resolved.\n\nBy making these changes, we should be able to overcome the parsing issue while maintaining the logical integrity of our proof. This will allow Isabelle to properly process the type declarations and move forward with verifying the proof itself.",
