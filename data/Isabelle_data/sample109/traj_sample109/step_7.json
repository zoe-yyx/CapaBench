Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Restructure the proof to more closely match the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left':\n   - Start by fixing an arbitrary function f\n   - Assume the antecedent: mono f\n   - Show the consequent: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n2. Unfold definitions explicitly:\n   - Use 'unfolding' commands for each definition (mono, shift_left1, preserved_by_shifting_left)\n   - This ensures that Isabelle is working with the expanded forms of these definitions\n\n3. Break down the proof into smaller, more explicit steps:\n   - Use 'have' statements to establish intermediate results\n   - Each step should directly follow from the previous one or from the assumptions\n\n4. Use more specific tactics:\n   - Replace 'blast' with more targeted tactics like 'simp' or 'auto'\n   - Use 'rule' tactics to apply specific inference rules when appropriate\n\n5. Make the logical flow of the proof more explicit:\n   - Clearly state what we're assuming and what we're trying to prove at each step\n   - Use 'thus' to show how each step contributes to the overall goal\n\n6. Consider introducing a helper lemma:\n   - If the main proof remains difficult, introduce a lemma that captures a key step in the reasoning\n   - Prove this lemma separately and then use it in the main proof\n\n7. Pay special attention to the relationship between n, m, and their incremented versions:\n   - Explicitly show how n ≤ m implies (n+1) ≤ (m+1)\n   - Use this to connect the monotonicity of f with the monotonicity of shift_left1 f\n\n8. Ensure that the final step of the proof directly establishes the goal:\n   - The last 'show' statement should exactly match the form of 'mono (shift_left1 f)'\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered a lexical error due to the use of unicode characters that were not properly recognized by Isabelle.\n\nImprovement: Replace all unicode characters (⇒, ≡, ∀, ⟶, ≤) with their ASCII equivalents (=>, ==, ! or ALL, -->, <=) throughout the theory file to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt was on the right track in terms of its logical structure and approach. However, it failed due to a fundamental issue with character encoding. Isabelle sometimes has difficulties with unicode characters, especially when they are copy-pasted from other sources or when the file encoding is not correctly set.\n\nTo address this issue and improve our next attempt:\n\n1. We should systematically replace all unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents:\n   - ⇒ becomes =>\n   - ≡ becomes ==\n   - ∀ becomes ! or ALL\n   - ⟶ becomes -->\n   - ≤ becomes <=\n\n2. We should maintain the overall structure of the proof, as it was logically sound:\n   - The use of 'unfold' for definitions\n   - The step-by-step approach with 'have' statements\n   - The use of 'assume' and 'thus' to clearly show the logical flow\n\n3. After making these changes, we should carefully review the entire proof to ensure that no logical steps were accidentally altered during the symbol replacement process.\n\n4. We should consider adding comments to explain key steps in the proof, which can help in understanding and debugging if further issues arise.\n\n5. If the error persists after replacing the symbols, we should verify the file encoding (UTF-8 is usually preferred) and ensure that Isabelle is configured to handle the correct character set.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to overcome the lexical error and proceed with evaluating the logical correctness of the proof.",
