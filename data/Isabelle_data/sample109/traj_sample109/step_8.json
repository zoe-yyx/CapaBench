    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\"\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Character Replacement: The first and most critical step is to replace all Unicode characters with their ASCII equivalents throughout the entire theory file. This includes:\n   - Replace ⇒ with =>\n   - Replace ≡ with ==\n   - Replace ∀ with ! or ALL\n   - Replace ⟶ with -->\n   - Replace ≤ with <=\n\n2. Maintain Proof Structure: The overall structure of the proof appears to be correct. After replacing the characters, we should keep the same logical flow:\n   - Unfold definitions\n   - Use 'assume' for hypotheses\n   - Use 'have' for intermediate steps\n   - Use 'thus' to connect the proof\n\n3. Review Definitions: After character replacement, carefully review all definitions to ensure they are still correct:\n   - mono\n   - shift_left1\n   - preserved_by_shifting_left\n\n4. Proof Steps: The proof steps should remain the same, focusing on:\n   - Unfolding the definition of preserved_by_shifting_left\n   - Showing that if f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic\n   - Using the assumption of f's monotonicity to prove the monotonicity of shift_left1 f\n\n5. Verification: After making these changes, we should attempt to run the proof again and carefully observe any new errors or warnings that may arise.\n\n6. Incremental Approach: If the proof still fails after character replacement, consider breaking it down into smaller lemmas or using 'sorry' temporarily to isolate which part of the proof is causing issues.\n\n7. Documentation: Add comments to explain key steps in the proof, which will help in understanding and debugging if further issues arise.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these changes, starting with the character replacement, and then carefully reviewing and adjusting the proof as needed while maintaining its logical structure.\n",
