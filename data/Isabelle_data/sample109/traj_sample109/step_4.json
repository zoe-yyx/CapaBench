    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\"\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe error message suggests that Isabelle is not recognizing 'mono' as a defined constant but instead interpreting it as a type variable. This indicates that we need to adjust our approach in using the 'mono' definition. Here's what we should do:\n\n1. First, let's ensure that the 'mono' definition is correctly recognized. We can do this by explicitly referring to it as 'MonoPl.mono' in our lemma statement and proof.\n\n2. We should also add type annotations to make the types explicit, which can help Isabelle understand our intentions better.\n\n3. It might be helpful to break down our proof into smaller steps. Let's start by proving that 'shift_left1 f' is monotonic when 'f' is monotonic, as a separate lemma.\n\n4. In our proof, we should be more explicit about unfolding definitions and using them.\n\nGiven these considerations, I suggest the following approach for the next proving operation:\n\n1. Define an auxiliary lemma that proves the monotonicity of 'shift_left1 f' given the monotonicity of 'f'.\n\n2. Use this auxiliary lemma to prove the main theorem.\n\n3. Add explicit type annotations and use fully qualified names for our definitions.\n\nHere's a sketch of how we might start:\n\nlemma shift_left1_mono:\n  assumes \"MonoPl.mono f\"\n  shows \"MonoPl.mono (MonoPl.shift_left1 f)\"\nproof -\n  -- \"Proof of auxiliary lemma goes here\"\nqed\n\nlemma mono_pl: \"MonoPl.preserved_by_shifting_left MonoPl.mono\"\nproof -\n  -- \"Main proof using shift_left1_mono goes here\"\nqed\n\nThis approach should help clarify the use of 'mono' and other defined constants, potentially resolving the syntax error we encountered.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, I can provide the following reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The error suggests a lexical issue with the type definition, specifically with the use of the symbol \"⇒\" (implies) in place of \"⇒\" (function arrow).\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of \"⇒\" with \"⇒\" in type definitions throughout the theory file to ensure correct syntax for function types.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the use of incorrect symbols in type definitions. The symbol \"⇒\" (Unicode U+21D2, implies) is being used where \"⇒\" (Unicode U+27F6, function arrow) should be used. This is a common error when copying and pasting from different sources or when using certain input methods.\n\nTo improve our approach:\n\n1. We should carefully review all type definitions in the theory file.\n2. Replace all instances of \"⇒\" with \"⇒\" in type signatures.\n3. Pay special attention to the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n4. After making these changes, we should be able to proceed with the proof strategy outlined in the previous thought.\n\nThis adjustment should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to properly parse the type definitions, enabling us to move forward with the proof of the target theorem.",
