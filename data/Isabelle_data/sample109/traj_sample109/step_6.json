Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current observation, our reasoning for the next step should focus on correcting the syntax errors caused by the use of Unicode symbols. Here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent:\n\n1. The primary issue is the use of Unicode symbols in the theory file, which Isabelle cannot parse in its default configuration. We need to replace all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents.\n\n2. Start by modifying the definition of 'mono'. Replace:\n   - '≡' with '=='\n   - '∀' with '!'\n   - '≤' with '<='\n   - '⟶' with '-->'\n\n3. Apply the same replacements to the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n\n4. In the proof of 'mono_pl', make sure to update any Unicode symbols that might be present in the proof steps as well.\n\n5. After making these changes, the definitions and lemma statement should be syntactically correct and parseable by Isabelle.\n\n6. Once the syntax is corrected, we can proceed with the proof strategy as originally planned, starting with unfolding the definitions and setting up the proof structure.\n\n7. Remember to maintain consistency in using ASCII symbols throughout the entire file to avoid similar issues in the future.\n\n8. After making these changes, carefully review the entire file to ensure all Unicode symbols have been replaced and the logical structure of definitions and proofs is preserved.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on systematically replacing all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents throughout the theory file. This should resolve the lexical errors and allow us to proceed with the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but it fails to refine the goal, indicating a mismatch between the proof steps and the goal statement.\n\nImprovement: We need to align the proof steps more closely with the goal structure, possibly by introducing intermediate lemmas or using more specific tactics to guide the proof.\n```\n\nBased on the current observation, the proof structure appears to be logically sound, but it's not successfully refining the goal. This suggests that while our approach is on the right track, we need to make some adjustments to ensure that each step in the proof is properly recognized and applied by Isabelle.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should consider the following:\n\n1. Break down the proof into smaller, more manageable steps. This could involve introducing intermediate lemmas that bridge the gap between our assumptions and the final goal.\n\n2. Use more explicit proof commands that clearly show how each step relates to the goal. For example, we might use 'have' statements to establish intermediate results before the final 'show' statement.\n\n3. Make sure we're using the correct Isabelle tactics. While 'blast' is a powerful tactic, it might be too general for this specific proof. We could try using more targeted tactics like 'simp' or 'auto' at appropriate points.\n\n4. Double-check that all definitions are being properly unfolded and applied. We might need to explicitly apply some definitions or use the 'simp add:' syntax to ensure all relevant definitions are considered.\n\n5. Consider using the 'apply' style of proof instead of the structured Isar proof, at least for parts of the proof. This might give us more fine-grained control over each step.\n\n6. Review the statement of the lemma and ensure that our proof directly addresses all aspects of the goal. We might need to adjust our proof structure to more closely match the structure of the 'preserved_by_shifting_left' definition.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing these improvements, starting with breaking down the proof into smaller steps and using more explicit proof commands. This should help us identify exactly where the proof is failing to refine the goal and allow us to make more targeted adjustments.",
