    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\", we should start by unfolding the definitions and setting up the proof structure. The key steps in our reasoning are:\n\n1. Unfold the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left':\n   This will give us the structure: ∀f. mono f ⟶ mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n2. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   We need to show that if f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   This means proving: ∀n m. n ≤ m ⟶ (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m\n\n3. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n4. Use the definition of 'shift_left1':\n   Replace (shift_left1 f) n with f (n + 1) and (shift_left1 f) m with f (m + 1)\n\n5. Apply the assumption that f is monotonic:\n   Since n ≤ m, we know that n + 1 ≤ m + 1, and therefore f (n + 1) ≤ f (m + 1)\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   The inequality f (n + 1) ≤ f (m + 1) directly proves that (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by unfolding the definitions and setting up the proof structure using appropriate Isabelle tactics.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was structurally correct, but encountered a database constraint error unrelated to the logical proof.\n\nImprovement: Retry the proof submission, ensuring the Isabelle environment and database are properly set up, while maintaining the current logical structure of the proof.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the issue encountered is not with the logical reasoning or proof structure, but rather with the Isabelle environment or database setup. The proof itself appears to be well-structured and follows the reasoning steps outlined in the previous thought process.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The planning and reasoning agents should maintain their current approach, as the proof structure seems correct.\n\n2. The acting agent should attempt to resubmit the proof, possibly after checking the Isabelle environment for any issues.\n\n3. If the error persists, it may be necessary to investigate the Isabelle setup, particularly the SQLite database that seems to be causing the constraint violation.\n\n4. In case the environment issues cannot be resolved immediately, consider documenting the proof structure in a comment or separate file to preserve the logical reasoning.\n\n5. If possible, try running the proof in a different Isabelle environment or instance to isolate whether the issue is specific to the current setup.\n\nThe overall goal of proving the theorem successfully remains unchanged, and the current proof structure aligns well with this objective. The focus should be on resolving the technical constraint rather than altering the logical approach to the proof.",
