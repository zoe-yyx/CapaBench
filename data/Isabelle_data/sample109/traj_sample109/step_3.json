    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\"\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a lexical error caused by the use of Unicode characters in type declarations, specifically the arrow symbol (⇒). To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we need to modify our theory file to use ASCII equivalents. Here's what we should do:\n\n1. Replace all instances of the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>). This applies to all type declarations in the definitions of mono, shift_left1, and preserved_by_shifting_left.\n\n2. While we're at it, we should also replace other Unicode symbols that might cause issues:\n   - Replace ≡ (equivalence) with == (ASCII equivalent)\n   - Replace ⟶ (implication) with --> (ASCII equivalent)\n   - Replace ∀ (universal quantifier) with ! (ASCII equivalent)\n   - Replace ≤ (less than or equal to) with <= (ASCII equivalent)\n\n3. After making these replacements, the definitions should look like this:\n\n   definition mono :: \"(int => int) => bool\" where\n     \"mono f == ! n m. n <= m --> f n <= f m\"\n\n   definition shift_left1 :: \"(int => int) => int => int\" where\n     \"shift_left1 f x == f (x + 1)\"\n\n   definition preserved_by_shifting_left :: \"((int => int) => bool) => bool\" where\n     \"preserved_by_shifting_left P == ! f. P f --> P (shift_left1 f)\"\n\n4. The lemma statement should also be updated:\n\n   lemma mono_pl: \"preserved_by_shifting_left mono\"\n\n5. In the proof itself, make sure to update any Unicode symbols used in the proof steps as well.\n\nBy making these changes, we should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to properly parse the type declarations and proceed with verifying the proof. Once these modifications are made, we can attempt to run the proof again and address any logical issues that may arise.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The error indicates a syntax issue with the 'mono' identifier, suggesting it's being interpreted as a type variable instead of a defined constant.\n\nImprovement: We need to ensure 'mono' is properly defined and recognized as a constant, possibly by adding explicit type annotations or checking for conflicting definitions in the theory file.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The error message suggests that Isabelle is interpreting 'mono' as a type variable rather than a defined constant. This could happen if the definition of 'mono' is not properly recognized or if there's a naming conflict.\n\n2. To address this, we should:\n   a) Double-check that the 'mono' definition is correct and properly placed in the theory file.\n   b) Ensure there are no conflicting uses of 'mono' elsewhere in the file.\n   c) Consider adding explicit type annotations where 'mono' is used, especially in the lemma statement.\n\n3. We might also want to try breaking down the proof into smaller steps, proving intermediate lemmas if necessary, to isolate where exactly the issue occurs.\n\n4. It's possible that the order of definitions or the way we're unfolding definitions in the proof is causing issues. We should review the structure of our proof and ensure we're introducing concepts in a logical order.\n\n5. If the issue persists, we might need to consult Isabelle's documentation or seek help from the Isabelle community to understand if there are any specific syntax requirements or best practices we're missing for defining and using functions like 'mono' in proofs.\n\nIn the next iteration, we should focus on addressing these potential issues, starting with a careful review of how 'mono' is defined and used throughout the theory file.",
