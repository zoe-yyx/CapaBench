    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"mono_pl: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\"\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n3. Apply the definition of 'mono':\n   - We need to show that if a function f is monotonic, then shift_left1 f is also monotonic.\n   - Unfold the definition of 'mono' for both f and shift_left1 f.\n\n4. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use the method of assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent.\n   - Assume: mono f\n   - Goal: mono (shift_left1 f)\n\n5. Prove the goal:\n   - Show that for any n and m where n ≤ m, we have (shift_left1 f) n ≤ (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This can be done by relating the inequalities of shift_left1 f to the inequalities of f.\n\n6. Use the monotonicity of f:\n   - Apply the assumption that f is monotonic to show that f(n+1) ≤ f(m+1).\n   - This directly relates to the definition of shift_left1.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that the inequality we proved for f(n+1) and f(m+1) implies the required inequality for (shift_left1 f) n and (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n8. Verify all cases are covered:\n   - Ensure that the proof holds for all possible integer inputs.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Check that all necessary steps have been completed and the theorem is fully proved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The primary issue we're facing is a lexical error due to the incorrect use of symbols in type definitions. Specifically, the symbol \"⇒\" (implies) is being used instead of \"⇒\" (function arrow) in type signatures.\n\n2. To resolve this issue, we need to systematically review and correct all type definitions in the theory file. This includes the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n\n3. The acting agent should:\n   a) Replace all instances of \"⇒\" with \"⇒\" in type signatures throughout the file.\n   b) Pay particular attention to lines where function types are defined, such as:\n      - The definition of 'mono'\n      - The definition of 'shift_left1'\n      - The definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'\n\n4. After making these corrections, the lexical error should be resolved, allowing Isabelle to properly parse the type definitions.\n\n5. Once the syntax errors are fixed, we can proceed with the proof strategy as originally planned:\n   a) Unfold the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'\n   b) Apply the definition of 'mono'\n   c) Set up the proof structure assuming 'mono f' and proving 'mono (shift_left1 f)'\n   d) Use the monotonicity of f to show that shift_left1 f is also monotonic\n\n6. It's important to verify each step after making the corrections to ensure no new errors are introduced and that the proof proceeds as expected.\n\n7. If any additional issues arise after fixing the type signatures, we should address them one by one, always ensuring that the basic definitions and lemma statements are correct before proceeding with the proof details.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The lexical error persists due to the use of Unicode symbols that Isabelle does not recognize in its standard syntax.\n\nImprovement: Replace all Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents throughout the theory file, specifically changing '≡' to '==', '∀' to '!', '≤' to '<=', and '⟶' to '-->'.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that despite our previous efforts to correct the type signatures, we overlooked the need to replace Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents in the logical expressions. This oversight is causing Isabelle to fail in parsing the propositions.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to systematically go through the entire theory file and replace all Unicode logical symbols with their ASCII counterparts. This includes:\n\n1. Replacing '≡' with '==' for definitions\n2. Replacing '∀' with '!' for universal quantification\n3. Replacing '≤' with '<=' for less than or equal to\n4. Replacing '⟶' with '-->' for implication\n\nBy making these changes, we should resolve the lexical errors and allow Isabelle to properly parse the definitions and lemma statements. Once these syntax issues are resolved, we can proceed with the proof strategy as originally planned.\n\nIt's crucial to maintain consistency throughout the file, ensuring that all logical expressions use the correct ASCII symbols. After making these changes, we should carefully review the entire file to confirm that no Unicode symbols remain and that the logical structure of our definitions and proofs is preserved.\n\nIn future interactions, we should be more mindful of using ASCII symbols from the start when working with Isabelle, as it expects standard ASCII input for logical symbols in its default configuration.",
