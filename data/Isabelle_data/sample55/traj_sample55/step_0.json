    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem 'mult_assoc', which states that multiplication is associative.\n   - The 'assoc' function is defined to represent associativity for any binary operation.\n\n2. Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of multiplication.\n   - This will transform the goal into a more concrete form involving universal quantifiers and equality.\n\n3. Apply Universal Quantification:\n   - Introduce arbitrary variables (x, y, z) to represent any integers.\n\n4. Simplify the Goal:\n   - After unfolding and introducing variables, the goal should resemble:\n     \"(\\<lambda>x y. x * y) x ((\\<lambda>x y. x * y) y z) = (\\<lambda>x y. x * y) ((\\<lambda>x y. x * y) x y) z\"\n\n5. Beta-Reduction:\n   - Simplify the lambda expressions by applying beta-reduction.\n   - This should result in: \"x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z\"\n\n6. Use Arithmetic Properties:\n   - At this point, the goal is to prove the standard form of multiplication associativity.\n   - Utilize built-in lemmas or axioms about integer multiplication in Isabelle/HOL.\n\n7. Apply Reflexivity:\n   - If Isabelle recognizes the associativity of multiplication automatically, apply reflexivity.\n\n8. Manual Proof (if needed):\n   - If automatic methods don't succeed, consider a manual proof using induction on one of the variables.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Once the equality is proven, the original theorem 'mult_assoc' should be established.\n\n10. Verify:\n    - Double-check that all steps are logically sound and that the proof is complete.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem 'mult_assoc', our first step should be to unfold the definition of 'assoc' in the context of multiplication. This will transform our goal into a more concrete form that we can work with.\n\nThe reasoning behind this step is as follows:\n\n1. The theorem 'mult_assoc' is stated using the 'assoc' function, which is a higher-order function defined to represent associativity for any binary operation.\n\n2. To prove that multiplication is associative, we need to show that it satisfies the definition of 'assoc' when applied to the multiplication operation.\n\n3. Unfolding the definition will expose the underlying logical structure of associativity in terms of multiplication, which will give us a clear target to prove.\n\n4. This step aligns with our planning strategy, specifically points 2 and 3, which involve unfolding definitions and applying universal quantification.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on unfolding the definition of 'assoc' and applying it to the multiplication operation. This will set up the proof structure for the subsequent steps of introducing variables and simplifying the goal.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof encountered a lexical error due to the use of non-ASCII characters (⇒) in the type definition, which Isabelle's parser could not process correctly.\n\nImprovement: Replace all non-ASCII characters with their ASCII equivalents (e.g., replace ⇒ with =>) and ensure all special symbols are properly encoded for Isabelle to parse correctly.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights a critical issue in the current proof attempt. The use of non-standard characters, specifically the double arrow (⇒) in the type definition, has caused a lexical error that prevents Isabelle from processing the theory file correctly. This is a common issue when working with theorem provers that have specific requirements for input formatting.\n\nTo improve the next steps, we should focus on:\n\n1. Carefully reviewing and replacing all non-ASCII characters in the theory file with their ASCII equivalents. For example, ⇒ should be replaced with =>, and ≡ with ==.\n\n2. Double-checking other special symbols and ensuring they are properly encoded for Isabelle. This includes symbols like ∀ (which should be \\<forall>) and λ (which should be \\<lambda>).\n\n3. Verifying that the file encoding is correct and compatible with Isabelle's requirements.\n\n4. After making these changes, re-attempting the proof with the corrected syntax.\n\n5. Considering the use of Isabelle-specific text editors or IDEs that can automatically handle these character conversions and highlight syntax errors.\n\nBy addressing these syntax issues, we should be able to progress to the actual logical proof of the theorem without being hindered by parsing errors. This will allow us to focus on the mathematical reasoning required to prove the associativity of multiplication.",
