    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem 'mult_assoc', which states that multiplication is associative.\n   - The 'assoc' function is defined to represent associativity for any binary operation.\n\n2. Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of multiplication.\n   - This will transform the goal into a more concrete form involving universal quantifiers and equality.\n\n3. Apply Universal Quantification:\n   - Introduce arbitrary variables (x, y, z) to represent any integers.\n\n4. Simplify the Goal:\n   - After unfolding and introducing variables, the goal should resemble:\n     \"(\\<lambda>x y. x * y) x ((\\<lambda>x y. x * y) y z) = (\\<lambda>x y. x * y) ((\\<lambda>x y. x * y) x y) z\"\n\n5. Beta-Reduction:\n   - Simplify the lambda expressions by applying beta-reduction.\n   - This should result in: \"x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z\"\n\n6. Use Arithmetic Properties:\n   - At this point, the goal is to prove the standard form of multiplication associativity.\n   - Utilize built-in lemmas or axioms about integer multiplication in Isabelle/HOL.\n\n7. Apply Reflexivity:\n   - If Isabelle recognizes the associativity of multiplication automatically, apply reflexivity.\n\n8. Manual Proof (if needed):\n   - If automatic methods don't succeed, consider a manual proof using induction on one of the variables.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Once the equality is proven, the original theorem 'mult_assoc' should be established.\n\n10. Verify:\n    - Double-check that all steps are logically sound and that the proof is complete.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The primary issue preventing progress is the use of non-ASCII characters in the theory file. We need to correct this before proceeding with the actual proof.\n\n   a) Replace ⇒ with => in the type definition:\n      Change \"(int ⇒ int ⇒ int) ⇒ bool\" to \"(int => int => int) => bool\"\n\n   b) Replace ≡ with == in the definition:\n      Change \"assoc f ≡ ∀ x y z.\" to \"assoc f == \\<forall> x y z.\"\n\n   c) Replace ∀ with \\<forall> for proper Isabelle syntax:\n      Ensure it reads \"\\<forall> x y z.\" instead of \"∀ x y z.\"\n\n   d) Replace λ with \\<lambda> in the lemma statement:\n      Change \"(λx y. x * y)\" to \"(\\<lambda>x y. x * y)\"\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   Once the syntax is corrected, we can focus on the proof itself. The current proof attempt looks correct in its approach:\n\n   a) Unfold the definition of 'assoc' using 'unfolding assoc_def'\n   b) Apply simplification with the built-in associativity of multiplication using 'by (simp add: mult.assoc)'\n\n   This structure should be maintained as it directly addresses the goal of proving multiplication associativity.\n\n3. Verification:\n   After making these syntax corrections, we should verify that:\n   a) The theory file compiles without lexical errors\n   b) The proof goes through as expected\n\n4. Next Steps:\n   If the proof succeeds after these corrections, no further steps are needed. If issues persist, we may need to:\n   a) Expand the proof by explicitly showing the steps after unfolding the definition\n   b) Use 'apply' style proofs for more granular control over each step\n   c) Consider using 'auto' or other automated tactics if 'simp' alone is insufficient\n\nRemember, the key is to first resolve the syntax issues, then verify the logical structure of the proof.\n",
