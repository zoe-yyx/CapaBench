    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and planning strategy, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. Start by stating the theorem using the 'theorem' command in Isabelle.\n\n2. Use the 'iff' proof method to break down the bi-directional implication into two separate implications that need to be proved.\n\n3. For the left-to-right direction (\"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q) \\<Longrightarrow> (\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q)\"):\n   - Begin with the assumption \"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\"\n   - Use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the negation of the conclusion \"P \\<and> \\<not>(\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q)\"\n   - Simplify this assumption to \"P \\<and> Q\"\n   - This directly contradicts our initial assumption\n   - Use this contradiction to conclude \"\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q\"\n\n4. For the right-to-left direction (\"(\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q) \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\"):\n   - Start with the assumption \"\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q\"\n   - Use case analysis on this disjunction\n   - For the case \"\\<not> P\", show it implies \"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\"\n   - For the case \"\\<not> Q\", show it implies \"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\"\n   - Combine these cases to conclude \"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\"\n\n5. Try to use Isabelle's automated proof methods like 'auto' or 'blast' for each direction if possible, as they might be able to handle these logical inferences automatically.\n\n6. If automated methods don't succeed, be prepared to break down the proof into smaller, more explicit steps using Isar proof language.\n\nThe acting agent should start by stating the theorem and applying the 'iff' method to set up the proof structure.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof appears to be correct, but there seems to be an issue with the Isabelle environment or database, causing an SQL error.\n\nImprovement: We need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and that all necessary databases are present and accessible before proceeding with the proof.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and reasoning appear to be correct and follow a logical approach to proving the theorem. The proof successfully demonstrates both directions of the bi-implication using contradiction and case analysis as suggested in the reasoning step.\n\nHowever, the error message indicates a problem with the Isabelle environment rather than with the proof itself. Specifically, it seems that there's an issue with accessing a required database table (isabelle_sources).\n\nTo improve the situation:\n\n1. Verify that Isabelle is correctly installed and all components are up to date.\n2. Check if there are any missing or corrupted database files in the Isabelle installation.\n3. Ensure that the Isabelle environment variables are correctly set.\n4. If possible, try running Isabelle in a different environment or on a different machine to isolate whether the issue is specific to the current setup.\n5. Consider reaching out to Isabelle support or community forums if the issue persists, as it may be a system-specific problem rather than a proof-related one.\n\nFor the next steps, once the environment issue is resolved, we should be able to run the proof as is, as it appears to be structurally sound and complete. If any further refinements are needed, they can be addressed after confirming that the proof runs successfully in a properly configured Isabelle environment.",
