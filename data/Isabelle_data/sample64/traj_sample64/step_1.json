    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states: \"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q) \\<longleftrightarrow> (\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q)\"\n   - This is a logical equivalence (if and only if) between two propositions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' proof method to prove both directions of the equivalence\n   - Prove left to right: \"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q) \\<Longrightarrow> (\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q)\"\n   - Prove right to left: \"(\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q) \\<Longrightarrow> \\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\"\n\n3. Left to right proof strategy:\n   - Start with the assumption \"\\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\"\n   - Use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume \"P \\<and> Q\" and derive a contradiction\n   - Conclude \"\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q\" using the law of excluded middle\n\n4. Right to left proof strategy:\n   - Start with the assumption \"\\<not> P \\<or> \\<not> Q\"\n   - Use case analysis on the disjunction\n   - For each case (\\<not> P and \\<not> Q), show that it implies \\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\n   - Combine the cases to conclude \\<not> (P \\<and> Q)\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's automated proof methods:\n   - Try using 'auto' or 'blast' for simple logical inferences\n   - If automated methods fail, break down the proof into smaller steps\n\n6. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that both directions of the equivalence are properly established\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that the proof structure appears to be correct and follows the planned strategy, but there's an issue with the Isabelle environment, our reasoning for the next step should focus on resolving the technical problem rather than modifying the proof itself. Here's the reasoning for the next action:\n\n1. The SQL error suggests a problem with accessing the Isabelle database, specifically the 'isabelle_sources' table. This is likely an installation or configuration issue rather than a problem with the proof itself.\n\n2. Before proceeding with any changes to the proof, we need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is functioning correctly. This is crucial because even a correct proof cannot be verified if the underlying system is not working properly.\n\n3. The acting agent should focus on troubleshooting the Isabelle environment. This may involve:\n   a. Checking the Isabelle installation for completeness and integrity.\n   b. Verifying that all necessary components, including databases, are present and accessible.\n   c. Ensuring that environment variables and paths are correctly set.\n   d. If possible, attempting to run a simple, known-good Isabelle theory to isolate whether the issue is specific to this proof or a general system problem.\n\n4. If the environment issues are resolved and the proof can be executed without errors, then we can proceed with verifying the correctness of the proof as it stands.\n\n5. In the event that the environment cannot be fixed immediately, consider documenting the proof in a plain text format or another theorem prover to ensure the logical structure is preserved while working on resolving the technical issues.\n\nThe next action should be to address the Isabelle environment issue rather than modifying the proof content. Once the environment is functioning correctly, we can revisit the proof to ensure it executes as expected and make any necessary refinements.\n",
