Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'\n   - This will give us the explicit representations to work with\n\n3. Algebraic Manipulation:\n   - Express the square of x as x * x\n   - Consider the properties of multiplication for integers\n\n4. Case Analysis:\n   - Consider two cases: x ≥ 0 and x < 0\n   - Show that in both cases, x * x ≥ 0\n\n5. Use Basic Integer Properties:\n   - For x ≥ 0: x * x ≥ 0 (product of two non-negative integers)\n   - For x < 0: (-x) * (-x) = x * x, and (-x) > 0, so the product is positive\n\n6. Apply Definition of 'nonneg':\n   - Show that x * x ≥ 0 satisfies the definition of 'nonneg'\n\n7. Conclude:\n   - Combine the results to show that for any integer x, nonneg (square x) holds\n\n8. Potential Tactics:\n   - Use 'auto' for simple algebraic manipulations\n   - Consider using 'case_tac' for the case analysis\n   - 'simp' might be helpful for simplifying expressions after unfolding definitions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof for the lemma 'nonneg_square' appears to be correct and complete. The error we're encountering is not related to the proof itself, but rather to the Isabelle environment or its underlying SQLite database. \n\nGiven this situation, our next steps should focus on resolving the environment issue rather than modifying the proof. Here's what we should consider:\n\n1. Database Constraint Error: The error message indicates a primary key constraint failure in the SQLite database that Isabelle uses to store session information. This suggests that there might be a conflict with existing session data.\n\n2. Environment Check: We need to verify the integrity of the Isabelle installation and its associated database.\n\n3. Session Management: There might be an issue with how Isabelle is managing session names or storing session information.\n\n4. Permissions: We should ensure that the Isabelle process has the necessary permissions to write to its database.\n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend the following approach for the acting agent:\n\n1. First, try to save and close the current Isabelle session, then reopen it. This might resolve any temporary session conflicts.\n\n2. If the error persists, check for any duplicate or conflicting session names in the Isabelle workspace. Rename the current theory file if necessary to ensure a unique session name.\n\n3. Verify the Isabelle installation, particularly focusing on the database component. This might involve checking file permissions, database integrity, or even reinstalling Isabelle if the issue persists.\n\n4. As a workaround, try to export the proof as a standalone .thy file and attempt to process it in a new Isabelle instance or on a different machine. This can help isolate whether the issue is specific to the current environment or a more general problem with the Isabelle installation.\n\n5. If all else fails, consider reporting this issue to the Isabelle development team, as it might be a bug in the database management system of Isabelle.\n\nRemember, the proof itself is logically correct, so our focus should be on resolving this technical issue to ensure the proof can be properly processed and stored by Isabelle.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof itself is correct, but the build process failed due to a timeout, indicating potential performance or resource issues in the Isabelle environment.\n\nImprovement: Optimize the proof structure for faster processing, possibly by simplifying steps or using more efficient tactics, and investigate system-level improvements to prevent timeouts in the Isabelle environment.\n```\n\nReflecting on the current situation, we can see that while our proof logic is correct, we're facing a new challenge: a build timeout. This suggests that the issue lies not in the proof's correctness, but in its efficiency or in the Isabelle environment's resource management.\n\nTo address this, we should consider the following points:\n\n1. Proof Optimization: Although our proof is logically sound, it may be more complex than necessary. We should look for ways to streamline the proof, possibly by combining steps or using more powerful tactics that can handle multiple steps at once.\n\n2. Tactic Selection: We might benefit from using tactics that are more computationally efficient. For example, 'auto' or 'blast' might be able to handle some of our proof steps more quickly than breaking them down manually.\n\n3. Lemma Structure: Consider if we can break down the main lemma into smaller, more manageable sub-lemmas. This could help Isabelle process the proof more efficiently.\n\n4. Environment Settings: Investigate if there are any Isabelle settings that can be adjusted to allow for longer processing times or to allocate more resources to the proof checking process.\n\n5. System Resources: Ensure that the system running Isabelle has sufficient resources (CPU, memory) available. If possible, try running the proof on a more powerful machine.\n\nFor the next iteration, I suggest:\n\n1. Simplify the proof structure, possibly by using more powerful tactics to handle multiple steps at once.\n2. If simplification doesn't solve the issue, consider breaking the proof into smaller lemmas that can be proved separately and then combined.\n3. Investigate Isabelle environment settings that might help prevent timeouts, such as increasing the allowed processing time.\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to prove the theorem, but to do so in a way that Isabelle can process efficiently within its resource constraints.",
