    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - Understand the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'\n   - Identify the goal: prove that the square of any integer is non-negative\n\n2. Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'\n   - This will give us the explicit representations to work with\n\n3. Algebraic Manipulation:\n   - Express the square of x as x * x\n   - Consider the properties of multiplication for integers\n\n4. Case Analysis:\n   - Consider two cases: x ≥ 0 and x < 0\n   - Show that in both cases, x * x ≥ 0\n\n5. Use Basic Integer Properties:\n   - For x ≥ 0: x * x ≥ 0 (product of two non-negative integers)\n   - For x < 0: (-x) * (-x) = x * x, and (-x) > 0, so the product is positive\n\n6. Apply Definition of 'nonneg':\n   - Show that x * x ≥ 0 satisfies the definition of 'nonneg'\n\n7. Conclude:\n   - Combine the results to show that for any integer x, nonneg (square x) holds\n\n8. Potential Tactics:\n   - Use 'auto' for simple algebraic manipulations\n   - Consider using 'case_tac' for the case analysis\n   - 'simp' might be helpful for simplifying expressions after unfolding definitions\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   The primary issue is the incorrect use of \"⇒\" instead of \"→\" in type declarations. This needs to be fixed immediately to allow Isabelle to parse the theory file correctly.\n\n2. Proof Structure Review:\n   Once the syntax is corrected, review the overall proof structure. The current approach using case analysis is appropriate for this problem.\n\n3. Case Analysis Completion:\n   For each case in the proof:\n   a) When x ≥ 0:\n      - Use the fact that the product of two non-negative integers is non-negative.\n      - Apply simp or auto to simplify x * x ≥ 0.\n   b) When x < 0:\n      - Consider that (-x) > 0 in this case.\n      - Show that x * x = (-x) * (-x), which is the product of two positive numbers.\n      - Again, use simp or auto to conclude that this product is non-negative.\n\n4. Connecting to Definitions:\n   Ensure that each step of the proof connects back to the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'. The current proof structure already does this well, but make sure to maintain these connections as you fill in the details.\n\n5. Utilize Isabelle's Automation:\n   Make use of Isabelle's automated reasoning capabilities. After stating each logical step, try applying tactics like 'simp', 'auto', or 'arith' to let Isabelle handle the arithmetic reasoning.\n\n6. Avoid 'sorry':\n   Replace all instances of 'sorry' with actual proof steps, ensuring that each logical step is justified.\n\n7. Final Verification:\n   After completing the proof, run it through Isabelle to ensure there are no remaining errors or gaps in the logic.\n\nNext immediate action: Correct the syntax errors by replacing \"⇒\" with \"→\" in all type declarations, then proceed with filling in the proof details for each case in the case analysis.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists due to the use of Unicode arrow (→) instead of ASCII arrow (->) in type declarations, which Isabelle cannot parse correctly.\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of the Unicode arrow (→) with the ASCII arrow (->) in type declarations to ensure Isabelle can correctly parse the theory file.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is that while the previous action attempted to correct the syntax by replacing \"⇒\" with \"→\", it inadvertently introduced a new problem by using a Unicode arrow instead of the ASCII arrow that Isabelle expects. This shows that we need to be more precise in our syntax corrections.\n\nTo improve our approach:\n\n1. We should be more explicit about the exact characters to use in Isabelle syntax. In this case, we need to use \"->\" for function types, not \"→\".\n\n2. We should always verify that our syntax changes are compatible with Isabelle's parser. This might involve double-checking against Isabelle documentation or testing with simpler examples first.\n\n3. In the future, when making syntax corrections, we should consider providing the exact string to use, possibly with a note about using ASCII characters where necessary.\n\n4. We should also consider running a quick syntax check after making changes, before proceeding with the full proof, to catch these issues early.\n\n5. The overall proof structure and reasoning seem sound, so once we correct this syntax issue, we should be able to proceed with the proof as planned.\n\nFor the next action step, we should carefully review and correct all type declarations in the theory file, ensuring we use \"->\" instead of \"→\" or \"⇒\". After making these corrections, we should attempt to load the theory in Isabelle again to verify that the syntax errors have been resolved before proceeding with the proof details.",
