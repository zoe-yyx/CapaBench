    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - Understand the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'\n   - Identify the goal: prove that the square of any integer is non-negative\n\n2. Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'\n   - This will give us the explicit representations to work with\n\n3. Algebraic Manipulation:\n   - Express the square of x as x * x\n   - Consider the properties of multiplication for integers\n\n4. Case Analysis:\n   - Consider two cases: x ≥ 0 and x < 0\n   - Show that in both cases, x * x ≥ 0\n\n5. Use Basic Integer Properties:\n   - For x ≥ 0: x * x ≥ 0 (product of two non-negative integers)\n   - For x < 0: (-x) * (-x) = x * x, and (-x) > 0, so the product is positive\n\n6. Apply Definition of 'nonneg':\n   - Show that x * x ≥ 0 satisfies the definition of 'nonneg'\n\n7. Conclude:\n   - Combine the results to show that for any integer x, nonneg (square x) holds\n\n8. Potential Tactics:\n   - Use 'auto' for simple algebraic manipulations\n   - Consider using 'case_tac' for the case analysis\n   - 'simp' might be helpful for simplifying expressions after unfolding definitions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the timeout issue we're facing, our primary goal should be to simplify and optimize the proof structure while maintaining its logical correctness. We should aim for a more concise proof that Isabelle can process more efficiently. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. Simplification: Our current proof, while correct, may be more verbose than necessary. We should aim to condense it by using more powerful tactics and combining steps where possible.\n\n2. Tactic Optimization: Instead of breaking down each step manually, we can leverage Isabelle's automated reasoning capabilities more extensively. Tactics like 'auto', 'simp', or 'blast' might be able to handle larger portions of the proof more efficiently.\n\n3. Structure Adjustment: We can try to restructure the proof to avoid nested cases, which might be contributing to the complexity and processing time.\n\n4. Direct Approach: Given that we're dealing with integer arithmetic, we might be able to prove the theorem more directly without explicit case analysis.\n\nBased on these considerations, I suggest the following approach for the next proof attempt:\n\n1. Start by unfolding the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'.\n2. Use the fact that for any integer x, x^2 ≥ 0. This is a fundamental property of integer arithmetic.\n3. Apply this fact directly to our definitions without splitting into cases.\n4. Use automated tactics like 'auto' or 'simp' to handle the algebraic manipulations.\n\nThis approach should lead to a more concise proof that Isabelle can process more quickly, potentially avoiding the timeout issue.\n",
