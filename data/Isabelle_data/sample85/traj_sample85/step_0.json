Algebraic Manipulation:\n   - Express the square of x as x * x\n   - Consider the properties of multiplication for integers\n\n4. Case Analysis:\n   - Consider two cases: x ≥ 0 and x < 0\n   - Show that in both cases, x * x ≥ 0\n\n5. Use Basic Integer Properties:\n   - For x ≥ 0: x * x ≥ 0 (product of two non-negative integers)\n   - For x < 0: (-x) * (-x) = x * x, and (-x) > 0, so the product is positive\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the lemma \"nonneg_square: nonneg (square x)\", we should start by unfolding the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'. This will give us a clear understanding of what we're working with and allow us to see the explicit representations of these terms.\n\nThe next step should be to apply these definitions to the goal. By doing so, we'll transform the goal into a more concrete form that we can work with using algebraic manipulation and integer properties.\n\nAfter unfolding the definitions, we should be able to see that we need to prove that x * x ≥ 0 for any integer x. This is a well-known property of squares, but we need to prove it formally in Isabelle.\n\nGiven that we're dealing with integers, a case analysis on whether x is non-negative or negative could be beneficial. This approach aligns with the planning strategy and will allow us to cover all possible cases for x.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on:\n1. Unfolding the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'\n2. Applying these definitions to the goal\n3. Setting up a case analysis for x ≥ 0 and x < 0\n\nThese steps will lay the foundation for the rest of the proof and align well with the planned strategy.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof contains syntax errors, specifically in the type declarations using \"⇒\" instead of \"→\" for function types.\n\nImprovement: Replace all instances of \"⇒\" with \"→\" in type declarations to correct the syntax errors and ensure proper parsing of the theory file.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights a critical syntax issue that is preventing the Isabelle theory from being parsed correctly. The use of \"⇒\" instead of \"→\" for function types is causing lexical errors. This is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed before any further progress can be made on the proof.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should carefully review and correct all type declarations in the theory file, ensuring that \"→\" is used consistently for function types.\n\n2. After fixing the syntax errors, the proof structure seems sound, but it relies heavily on 'sorry' statements. These should be replaced with actual proof steps.\n\n3. For the case analysis, instead of using 'sorry', the acting agent should provide explicit reasoning for each case. For the case where x ≥ 0, it should be straightforward to show that x * x ≥ 0. For the case where x < 0, the agent should demonstrate that a negative number multiplied by itself yields a positive result.\n\n4. The reasoning agent should focus on leveraging Isabelle's built-in simplification and arithmetic reasoning capabilities to complete these proof steps.\n\n5. Once the syntax is corrected and the 'sorry' statements are replaced, the acting agent should run the proof again to ensure it passes without errors.\n\nThese adjustments will help move the proof towards completion and align with the goal of rigorously proving the nonneg_square lemma without relying on 'sorry' statements.",
