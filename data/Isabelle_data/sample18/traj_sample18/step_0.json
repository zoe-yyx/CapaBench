    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for mul_add_distr_r theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the distributive property of multiplication over addition for our custom natural number type (mynat).\n   - We need to show: mymul (myadd n m) p = myadd (mymul n p) (mymul m p)\n\n2. Identify available resources:\n   - We have definitions for myadd and mymul functions.\n   - The myadd_assoc theorem is already proved and can be used.\n\n3. Choose the proof strategy:\n   - Induction on 'n' seems appropriate, as mymul and myadd are defined recursively.\n\n4. Outline the proof structure:\n   a. Base case: n = MyZero\n   b. Inductive case: n = MySuc n'\n\n5. Plan for the base case:\n   - Simplify mymul (myadd MyZero m) p\n   - Show it equals myadd (mymul MyZero p) (mymul m p)\n\n6. Plan for the inductive case:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for n', prove for MySuc n'\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis\n   - Apply definitions of myadd and mymul\n   - Use myadd_assoc theorem to rearrange terms\n\n7. Proof techniques to employ:\n   - Use induction method\n   - Apply simp for simplification\n   - Use substitution (subst) for applying definitions and theorems\n   - Potentially use case analysis (cases) if needed\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - After completing the proof, consider if any lemmas could be extracted to simplify the main proof or be useful for future theorems.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the mul_add_distr_r theorem, considering the available definitions and theorems, and outlining the key steps and techniques to be used in the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem mul_add_distr_r, we should follow the plan and start with induction on 'n'. This is because both myadd and mymul are defined recursively, and induction is a powerful technique for proving properties of recursive functions.\n\nThe reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. We should apply induction on 'n' to break down the problem into a base case and an inductive case.\n\n2. For the induction method, we don't need to specify a variable as 'n' is the first variable in the theorem statement.\n\n3. After applying induction, we'll have two subgoals:\n   a. Base case: where n = MyZero\n   b. Inductive case: where n = MySuc n' for some n'\n\n4. The acting agent should use the 'induction' method to start the proof.\n\n5. After applying induction, we should be prepared to handle each case separately, starting with the base case.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to apply induction on 'n'. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof and allow us to tackle each case systematically.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type declarations, specifically with the arrow symbol \"⇒\" used in function type definitions.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\" in all function type declarations to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the syntax used for type declarations. The Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" is causing a lexical error, which prevents Isabelle from parsing the theory file correctly. \n\nTo improve the situation, we need to modify the type declarations for both `myadd` and `mymul` functions. Instead of using the Unicode arrow \"⇒\", we should use the ASCII equivalent \"=>\". This change should be applied consistently throughout the theory file.\n\nFor future actions:\n\n1. The planning agent should include a step to check and ensure proper syntax is used, especially for common symbols like arrows in type declarations.\n\n2. The reasoning agent should be aware of potential syntax issues and consider them when analyzing errors.\n\n3. The acting agent should make the necessary changes to replace \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in all function type declarations.\n\n4. After making these changes, we can proceed with the original plan of proving the theorem using induction on 'n'.\n\nBy addressing this syntax issue, we should be able to move forward with the proof without encountering parsing errors, allowing us to focus on the logical aspects of the theorem.",
