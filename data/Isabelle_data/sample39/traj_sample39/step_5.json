    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"plus_one_mono\":\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of \"plus_one\"\n   - Analyze the definition of \"mono\"\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Expand \"mono plus_one\" using the definition of \"mono\"\n   - This will lead to: ∀n m. n ≤ m ⟶ plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n3. Prove the expanded theorem:\n   a. Start with arbitrary integers n and m\n   b. Assume n ≤ m\n   c. Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n4. Use the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one n to n + 1\n   - Expand plus_one m to m + 1\n\n5. Utilize properties of integers:\n   - If n ≤ m, then n + 1 ≤ m + 1\n\n6. Connect the steps:\n   - Show that n + 1 ≤ m + 1 is equivalent to plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Demonstrate that the property holds for all n and m where n ≤ m\n   - This proves the mono property for plus_one\n\n8. Use Isabelle tactics:\n   - Apply appropriate tactics like 'auto', 'simp', or manual proof steps to formalize each part of the proof\n\n9. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the proof satisfies Isabelle's requirements\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Environmental Issue:\n   The primary obstacle is a technical problem with the Isabelle environment, specifically a readonly database error. This is preventing the proof from being executed and evaluated.\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   The proof structure itself appears to be correct and well-formulated. It follows the planned approach and uses appropriate tactics.\n\n3. Next Steps:\n   a. Resolve Environment Issues:\n      - Check and adjust database permissions.\n      - Ensure the database is in the correct location.\n      - Consider recreating the database if it has been moved or corrupted.\n      - If persistent, explore alternative Isabelle setups or installations.\n\n   b. Proof Execution:\n      - Once the environment is fixed, attempt to run the proof as-is.\n      - The current proof structure is concise and logical, using unfolding, rule application, and simplification, which aligns well with our initial plan.\n\n   c. Proof Verification:\n      - After successful execution, verify that each step of the proof is accepted by Isabelle.\n      - Ensure the final 'done' statement completes the proof without any remaining subgoals.\n\n   d. Potential Refinements:\n      - If any issues persist after fixing the environment, consider breaking down the proof into more explicit steps using 'show' statements.\n      - This could help isolate any logical issues and make the proof more robust.\n\n4. Documentation:\n   - Document the steps taken to resolve the environment issues for future reference.\n\n5. Theorem Validity:\n   - The theorem \"plus_one_mono\" should be proven once these steps are completed, demonstrating that the function plus_one is indeed monotonic.\n",
