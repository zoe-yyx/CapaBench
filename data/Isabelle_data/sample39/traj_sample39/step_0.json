Start with arbitrary integers n and m\n   b. Assume n ≤ m\n   c. Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n4. Use the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one n to n + 1\n   - Expand plus_one m to m + 1\n\n5. Utilize properties of integers:\n   - If n ≤ m, then n + 1 ≤ m + 1\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the lemma \"plus_one_mono: mono plus_one\", we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by unfolding the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one'. This will help us understand what we need to prove in terms of the basic operations.\n\n2. After unfolding the definitions, we'll need to prove that for all integers n and m, if n ≤ m, then plus_one n ≤ plus_one m.\n\n3. We should begin the proof by introducing arbitrary integers n and m, and assuming n ≤ m.\n\n4. Then, we'll need to show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m under this assumption.\n\n5. Given that there are no historical actions yet, we should start with the most basic proof structure and gradually build upon it.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin by unfolding the definitions and setting up the basic structure of the proof. This can be done using tactics like 'unfold' for the definitions and 'apply' with appropriate methods to start the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the type declaration of the 'plus_one' function, specifically with the arrow symbol \"⇒\".\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"->\" in the type declarations to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser and avoid lexical errors.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the use of Unicode symbols in the type declarations, which Isabelle's parser is struggling to interpret. The improvement suggests a straightforward solution by using ASCII equivalents, which are more widely supported and less likely to cause parsing issues.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Modify the type declarations in the theory file, replacing \"⇒\" with \"->\".\n2. Apply this change consistently throughout the file, including in the 'mono' definition.\n3. Re-run the proof attempt with these modifications.\n\nThis adjustment should resolve the lexical error and allow the proof to proceed. Once this basic issue is addressed, we can focus on the logical structure of the proof itself, ensuring that each step is correctly applied and that the proof is complete and rigorous.",
