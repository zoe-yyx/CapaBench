    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"plus_one_mono\":\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of \"plus_one\"\n   - Analyze the definition of \"mono\"\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Expand \"mono plus_one\" using the definition of \"mono\"\n   - This will lead to: ∀n m. n ≤ m ⟶ plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n3. Prove the expanded theorem:\n   a. Start with arbitrary integers n and m\n   b. Assume n ≤ m\n   c. Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n4. Use the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one n to n + 1\n   - Expand plus_one m to m + 1\n\n5. Utilize properties of integers:\n   - If n ≤ m, then n + 1 ≤ m + 1\n\n6. Connect the steps:\n   - Show that n + 1 ≤ m + 1 is equivalent to plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Demonstrate that the property holds for all n and m where n ≤ m\n   - This proves the mono property for plus_one\n\n8. Use Isabelle tactics:\n   - Apply appropriate tactics like 'auto', 'simp', or manual proof steps to formalize each part of the proof\n\n9. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the proof satisfies Isabelle's requirements\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a syntax error in the type declarations. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we need to focus on correcting the syntax in the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'mono'. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   - In the definition of 'plus_one', change \"int -> int\" to \"int ⇒ int\".\n   - In the definition of 'mono', change \"(int -> int) -> bool\" to \"(int ⇒ int) ⇒ bool\".\n   \n   Reasoning: Isabelle uses '⇒' for function types. The spaces around the arrow are important for readability and correct parsing.\n\n2. Unicode vs ASCII:\n   - If there are issues with Unicode rendering, we can use the ASCII alternative '=>' instead of '⇒'.\n   \n   Reasoning: Both forms are recognized by Isabelle, and using the ASCII version can help avoid potential encoding issues.\n\n3. Proof Structure:\n   - Once the syntax is corrected, the existing proof structure appears to be correct and should work.\n   \n   Reasoning: The proof steps (unfolding definitions, applying universal quantification, and using transitivity of order) are logically sound for this theorem.\n\n4. Verification:\n   - After making these changes, we should re-run the entire proof.\n   \n   Reasoning: This will confirm that the syntax errors are resolved and that the proof proceeds as expected.\n\n5. Optimization (if needed):\n   - If the proof succeeds, we can then look into potential optimizations or more elegant proof techniques.\n   \n   Reasoning: While correctness is the primary goal, a cleaner or more concise proof can be beneficial for readability and future maintenance.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to overcome the current syntax obstacle and successfully prove the 'plus_one_mono' theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error message indicates a database constraint issue, which is unrelated to the Isabelle proof itself.\nImprovement: We should focus on verifying the Isabelle proof directly, possibly by using a different environment or interface that doesn't rely on the problematic database.\n```\n\nThe current error message suggests that the issue is not with the Isabelle proof itself, but rather with the underlying system or environment used to run Isabelle. This database constraint error is likely occurring in a layer separate from the actual theorem proving process.\n\nTo move forward effectively:\n\n1. Environment Check: We should verify that we're using a stable and properly configured Isabelle environment. This might involve checking the installation, ensuring all dependencies are met, or possibly using a different interface to interact with Isabelle.\n\n2. Direct Proof Verification: If possible, we should try to run the proof directly in Isabelle/HOL without relying on the interface that's producing this database error. This could involve using Isabelle's command-line interface or a different front-end.\n\n3. Proof Integrity: Despite the error, the proof structure and syntax corrections made in the previous step appear to be correct. We should maintain confidence in these changes and focus on getting them properly executed in Isabelle.\n\n4. Alternative Proving Methods: If the environment issues persist, we might consider alternative ways to verify the proof, such as using a different theorem prover that can import Isabelle syntax, or manually checking the proof steps.\n\n5. Documentation: It would be helpful to document this error for future reference, as it might indicate a systemic issue that needs addressing in the broader setup or workflow.\n\nMoving forward, our primary goal should be to find a way to execute and verify the proof in a stable Isabelle environment, focusing on the mathematical and logical aspects of the proof rather than being hindered by external technical issues.",
