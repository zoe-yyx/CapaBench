    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"plus_one_mono\":\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of \"plus_one\"\n   - Analyze the definition of \"mono\"\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Expand \"mono plus_one\" using the definition of \"mono\"\n   - This will lead to: ∀n m. n ≤ m ⟶ plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n3. Prove the expanded theorem:\n   a. Start with arbitrary integers n and m\n   b. Assume n ≤ m\n   c. Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n4. Use the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one n to n + 1\n   - Expand plus_one m to m + 1\n\n5. Utilize properties of integers:\n   - If n ≤ m, then n + 1 ≤ m + 1\n\n6. Connect the steps:\n   - Show that n + 1 ≤ m + 1 is equivalent to plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Demonstrate that the property holds for all n and m where n ≤ m\n   - This proves the mono property for plus_one\n\n8. Use Isabelle tactics:\n   - Apply appropriate tactics like 'auto', 'simp', or manual proof steps to formalize each part of the proof\n\n9. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the proof satisfies Isabelle's requirements\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a syntax error in the type declarations, specifically the use of the Unicode arrow \"⇒\" which is causing a lexical error. To resolve this and proceed with the proof:\n\n1. Modify the type declarations in the theory file:\n   - Replace \"int ⇒ int\" with \"int -> int\" in the definition of plus_one\n   - Replace \"(int ⇒ int) ⇒ bool\" with \"(int -> int) -> bool\" in the definition of mono\n\n2. After making these changes, the basic structure of the proof attempt looks correct:\n   - Unfolding the definitions of mono and plus_one\n   - Using universal quantification (allI) and implication introduction (impI)\n   - Applying transitivity of order (order_trans)\n   - Using an assumption and simplification\n\n3. Once the syntax error is resolved, this proof structure should be valid. The next steps would be:\n   - Verify that the proof goes through after the syntax corrections\n   - If successful, consider if the proof can be made more concise or elegant\n   - If unsuccessful, analyze where the proof fails and adjust the tactics accordingly\n\n4. Pay attention to the expanded definitions and ensure that each step in the proof corresponds to the logical structure of the definitions and the goal.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on making these syntax corrections first, then re-run the proof attempt. If successful, we can then focus on optimizing or explaining the proof. If unsuccessful, we'll need to analyze the new error messages or proof state to guide further modifications.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists due to incorrect spacing in the type declarations, specifically \"int -> int\" should be \"int\\<rightarrow>int\".\n\nImprovement: Modify the type declarations to use the correct Isabelle syntax for function types by removing spaces around the arrow and using the Unicode arrow symbol (\\<rightarrow>).\n```\n\nThe current action attempted to fix the syntax error by replacing the Unicode arrow with a standard ASCII arrow (->). However, this did not resolve the issue because Isabelle requires a specific syntax for function types.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. Update the type declarations in both definitions:\n   - Change \"int -> int\" to \"int\\<rightarrow>int\"\n   - Change \"(int -> int) -> bool\" to \"(int\\<rightarrow>int)\\<rightarrow>bool\"\n\n2. Ensure there are no spaces around the arrow symbol in the type declarations.\n\n3. Double-check that the Unicode arrow symbol (\\<rightarrow>) is being used correctly. If there are issues with Unicode rendering, consider using the ASCII alternative (=>), which is also recognized by Isabelle.\n\n4. After making these corrections, re-run the proof attempt. The structure of the proof itself appears to be correct, so once the syntax issues are resolved, it should proceed without errors.\n\n5. If the proof succeeds after these changes, consider reviewing it for potential simplifications or more elegant approaches.\n\nBy addressing these syntax issues precisely, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and proceed with the proof of the target theorem.",
