    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving \"plus_one_mono\":\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of \"plus_one\"\n   - Analyze the definition of \"mono\"\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Expand \"mono plus_one\" using the definition of \"mono\"\n   - This will lead to: ∀n m. n ≤ m ⟶ plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n3. Prove the expanded theorem:\n   a. Start with arbitrary integers n and m\n   b. Assume n ≤ m\n   c. Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n4. Use the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one n to n + 1\n   - Expand plus_one m to m + 1\n\n5. Utilize properties of integers:\n   - If n ≤ m, then n + 1 ≤ m + 1\n\n6. Connect the steps:\n   - Show that n + 1 ≤ m + 1 is equivalent to plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Demonstrate that the property holds for all n and m where n ≤ m\n   - This proves the mono property for plus_one\n\n8. Use Isabelle tactics:\n   - Apply appropriate tactics like 'auto', 'simp', or manual proof steps to formalize each part of the proof\n\n9. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the proof satisfies Isabelle's requirements\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that the proof structure appears to be correct but we're facing a technical issue with the Isabelle environment, our reasoning should focus on alternative methods to verify and execute the proof:\n\n1. Direct Isabelle/HOL Execution:\n   Attempt to run the proof directly in Isabelle/HOL without the problematic interface. This could involve using Isabelle's command-line interface or a different front-end that doesn't interact with the failing database.\n\n2. Manual Verification:\n   While resolving the technical issue, we can manually verify each step of the proof:\n   a. Confirm that unfolding the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one' is correct.\n   b. Verify that applying (rule allI)+ correctly introduces universal quantifiers.\n   c. Check that (rule impI) properly handles the implication.\n   d. Ensure that (simp add: add_mono) is the appropriate simplification step.\n\n3. Proof Structure Analysis:\n   Although the current proof seems concise and logical, consider if there are any potential simplifications:\n   a. Is it possible to combine any steps?\n   b. Could the use of 'auto' or a similar tactic reduce the number of explicit steps?\n\n4. Alternative Proof Approach:\n   If the current method continues to face technical issues, consider an alternative proof strategy:\n   a. Try using 'unfold' instead of 'unfolding' at the beginning.\n   b. Attempt to prove the theorem using 'by' instead of 'apply' tactics.\n   c. Consider using 'show' statements to break down the proof into more explicit steps.\n\n5. Documentation:\n   Regardless of the approach taken, document the steps and any errors encountered. This will be valuable for troubleshooting and improving the proof process in the future.\n\nThe next action should be to attempt executing the proof in a stable Isabelle environment, free from the database constraint issues. If this is not immediately possible, proceed with manual verification and exploration of alternative proof structures.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof execution is failing due to technical issues with the Isabelle environment, specifically a readonly database error, rather than problems with the proof itself.\n\nImprovement: We should focus on resolving the Isabelle environment issues, possibly by ensuring write permissions for the database or using an alternative Isabelle setup, before attempting to execute the proof again.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current obstacle is not related to the proof's logic or structure, but rather to the technical environment in which we're trying to run it. The error message suggests that there's a problem with the database permissions or location, which is preventing Isabelle from properly executing the proof.\n\nTo move forward effectively, we should:\n\n1. Investigate and resolve the database issue. This might involve checking file permissions, ensuring the database is in the correct location, or potentially recreating the database if it has been moved or corrupted.\n\n2. Consider using an alternative Isabelle setup if the current environment continues to be problematic. This could mean using a different installation, a different interface, or even a cloud-based Isabelle environment if available.\n\n3. While working on resolving the technical issues, we can manually review the proof structure to ensure it's correct. The current proof steps seem logical and appropriate for the theorem we're trying to prove.\n\n4. Once the environment issues are resolved, we should attempt to run the proof again exactly as it is, as the structure appears to be correct and concise.\n\n5. If we continue to face technical difficulties, we might consider breaking down the proof into smaller, more explicit steps using 'show' statements. This could help isolate any potential issues and make the proof more robust against environmental quirks.\n\n6. Document the steps taken to resolve the environment issues for future reference, as this kind of technical problem could recur in other proofs or projects.\n\nBy addressing the technical environment first and then proceeding with the proof execution, we'll be better positioned to successfully prove the theorem and avoid similar issues in future proofs.",
