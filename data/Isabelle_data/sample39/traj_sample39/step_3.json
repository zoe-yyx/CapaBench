Break down the theorem:\n   - Expand \"mono plus_one\" using the definition of \"mono\"\n   - This will lead to: ∀n m. n ≤ m ⟶ plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n3. Prove the expanded theorem:\n   a. Start with arbitrary integers n and m\n   b. Assume n ≤ m\n   c. Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n4. Use the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one n to n + 1\n   - Expand plus_one m to m + 1\n\n5. Utilize properties of integers:\n   - If n ≤ m, then n + 1 ≤ m + 1\n\n6. Connect the steps:\n   - Show that n + 1 ≤ m + 1 is equivalent to plus_one n ≤ plus_one m\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Demonstrate that the property holds for all n and m where n ≤ m\n   - This proves the mono property for plus_one\n\n8. Use Isabelle tactics:\n   - Apply appropriate tactics like 'auto', 'simp', or manual proof steps to formalize each part of the proof\n\n9. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Check that the proof satisfies Isabelle's requirements\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Proof Validation: The proof structure developed in the previous step appears to be correct and follows a logical approach to proving the theorem. We should maintain confidence in this proof structure.\n\n2. Environment Troubleshooting: The current error is unrelated to the proof itself and suggests an issue with the Isabelle environment or the interface being used. We need to focus on resolving this technical issue to proceed with the proof verification.\n\n3. Alternative Execution: Given the database-related error, we should attempt to execute the proof directly in Isabelle/HOL without relying on the problematic interface. This could involve using Isabelle's command-line interface or a different front-end that doesn't interact with the failing database.\n\n4. Proof Refinement: While we work on resolving the technical issues, we can still analyze the proof for potential optimizations or simplifications. For instance, we could consider if the use of 'order_trans' is necessary or if the proof could be made more concise.\n\n5. Documentation: It's important to document this error and the steps taken to resolve it. This information could be valuable for future proofs or for improving the overall workflow.\n\n6. Verification Strategy: Once we have a working environment, we should focus on verifying each step of the proof, ensuring that Isabelle accepts each tactic and that the proof is complete.\n\n7. Exploration of Alternative Proofs: If the environment issues persist, we might consider exploring alternative proof strategies that might be less sensitive to the current technical limitations, while still proving the theorem correctly.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof execution is failing due to a database-related error, unrelated to the correctness of the proof itself.\nImprovement: We should focus on resolving the technical issue with the Isabelle environment or interface, possibly by using an alternative execution method or troubleshooting the database connection.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure appears to be correct and follows a logical approach to proving the theorem.

Attempt to execute the proof directly in Isabelle/HOL without relying on the problematic interface. This could involve using Isabelle's command-line interface or a different front-end that doesn't interact with the failing database.\n\n2. Troubleshoot the database issue. The error message suggests a problem with a PRIMARY KEY constraint in an SQLite database. This could be due to a conflict in session naming or a problem with the database schema.\n\n3. If direct execution in Isabelle is not immediately possible, we should document this error and the steps taken to resolve it. This information could be valuable for future proofs or for improving the overall workflow.\n\n4. While working on resolving the technical issues, we can still analyze the proof for potential optimizations or simplifications. However, the current proof structure seems concise and appropriate for the theorem.\n\n5.
