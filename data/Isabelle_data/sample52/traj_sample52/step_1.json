Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication (A → B)\n   - A is a conjunction of two bi-implications\n   - B is a bi-implication of two conjunctions\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'intro' method to introduce the antecedent as an assumption\n   - Apply 'rule iffI' to split the consequent into two implications\n\n3. Prove the left-to-right direction:\n   - Assume P1 ∧ Q1\n   - Use 'conjE' to separate P1 and Q1\n   - Use the assumptions from the antecedent to prove P2 and Q2\n   - Combine P2 and Q2 using 'conjI'\n\n4. Prove the right-to-left direction:\n   - Assume P2 ∧ Q2\n   - Use 'conjE' to separate P2 and Q2\n   - Use the assumptions from the antecedent to prove P1 and Q1\n   - Combine P1 and Q1 using 'conjI'\n\n5. Finalize the proof:\n   - The bi-implication should be proven by showing both directions\n\n6. Consider using automation:\n   - After setting up the basic structure, try using 'auto' or 'blast' to complete parts of the proof\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current proof structure and the identified improvements, here's the reasoning to guide the next proving operations:\n\n1. For the left-to-right direction (P1 ∧ Q1 → P2 ∧ Q2):\n   a. Start by using conjunction elimination on the assumption \"P1 ∧ Q1\" to obtain P1 and Q1 separately.\n   b. Then, use conjunction elimination on the main assumption \"(P1 ↔ P2) ∧ (Q1 ↔ Q2)\" to get \"P1 ↔ P2\" and \"Q1 ↔ Q2\".\n   c. From \"P1 ↔ P2\", use the left-to-right direction with the previously obtained P1 to deduce P2.\n   d. Similarly, from \"Q1 ↔ Q2\", use the left-to-right direction with the previously obtained Q1 to deduce Q2.\n   e. Finally, use conjunction introduction to combine P2 and Q2, proving \"P2 ∧ Q2\".\n\n2. For the right-to-left direction (P2 ∧ Q2 → P1 ∧ Q1):\n   a. Begin by using conjunction elimination on the assumption \"P2 ∧ Q2\" to obtain P2 and Q2 separately.\n   b. Again, use conjunction elimination on \"(P1 ↔ P2) ∧ (Q1 ↔ Q2)\" to get \"P1 ↔ P2\" and \"Q1 ↔ Q2\".\n   c. From \"P1 ↔ P2\", use the right-to-left direction with the previously obtained P2 to deduce P1.\n   d. Similarly, from \"Q1 ↔ Q2\", use the right-to-left direction with the previously obtained Q2 to deduce Q1.\n   e. Use conjunction introduction to combine P1 and Q1, proving \"P1 ∧ Q1\".\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps using appropriate Isabelle tactics such as 'conjE' for conjunction elimination, 'conjI' for conjunction introduction, and possibly 'iffD1' and 'iffD2' for using the left-to-right and right-to-left directions of bi-implications respectively.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt timed out, likely due to excessive complexity or inefficient proof structure.\nImprovement: Simplify the proof structure by using more direct tactics and combining steps where possible to reduce the overall proof complexity.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The timeout suggests that the proof structure may be overly complex or inefficient, causing the system to take too long to process it.\n\n2. While the logical steps in the proof appear correct, the way they are structured and implemented might be causing performance issues.\n\n3. To improve, we should consider:\n   - Using more direct tactics where possible, such as `simp` or `auto` for simpler logical steps.\n   - Combining multiple steps into single, more powerful tactics where appropriate.\n   - Ensuring that each step in the proof is necessary and contributes directly to the final goal.\n   - Possibly restructuring the proof to use fewer nested levels, which could help reduce processing time.\n\n4. The overall goal remains to prove the theorem successfully, but we need to balance completeness with efficiency.\n\n5. The proof doesn't explicitly use 'sorry', which is good. We should maintain this rigor while improving efficiency.\n\nFor the next iteration, the planning and reasoning agents should focus on streamlining the proof structure while maintaining its logical integrity. The acting agent should implement these changes, possibly using more powerful tactics or combining steps to reduce the overall complexity of the proof.",
