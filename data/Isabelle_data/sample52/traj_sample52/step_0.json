    "reasoning": "\nGiven the structure of the theorem and our planned approach, we should start by setting up the basic framework of the proof. The theorem is an implication, so we should begin by introducing the antecedent as an assumption. After that, we'll want to split the consequent into two implications to prove the bi-implication.\n\nReasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Use the 'intro' method to introduce the antecedent as an assumption. This will bring the left side of the main implication into our assumption context.\n\n2. Apply 'rule iffI' to split the consequent (right side of the main implication) into two implications. This sets up the structure for proving both directions of the bi-implication.\n\n3. For the left-to-right direction, we'll need to assume P1 ∧ Q1 and prove P2 ∧ Q2.\n\n4. For the right-to-left direction, we'll need to assume P2 ∧ Q2 and prove P1 ∧ Q1.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these initial steps to set up the proof structure. After this framework is in place, we can proceed with the detailed steps of proving each direction.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the 'sorry' command is used twice, leaving the proof incomplete and not rigorous.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'sorry' commands with detailed proof steps using the assumptions and logical reasoning to prove both directions of the bi-implication.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is a good start, as it correctly sets up the framework for proving the bi-implication. However, the use of 'sorry' in both directions of the proof indicates that the actual proving steps are missing. \n\nTo improve the proof, we need to focus on the following:\n\n1. For the left-to-right direction (P1 ∧ Q1 → P2 ∧ Q2):\n   - Use the assumption \"(P1 ↔ P2) ∧ (Q1 ↔ Q2)\" to prove that P1 implies P2 and Q1 implies Q2.\n   - Use the assumption \"P1 ∧ Q1\" to split it into P1 and Q1.\n   - Combine these to show P2 and Q2, then conjoin them.\n\n2. For the right-to-left direction (P2 ∧ Q2 → P1 ∧ Q1):\n   - Similarly, use the assumption \"(P1 ↔ P2) ∧ (Q1 ↔ Q2)\" to prove that P2 implies P1 and Q2 implies Q1.\n   - Use the assumption \"P2 ∧ Q2\" to split it into P2 and Q2.\n   - Combine these to show P1 and Q1, then conjoin them.\n\nIn both cases, we should make use of conjunction elimination (to split assumptions) and introduction (to form the final conjunction), as well as the properties of bi-implication. The reasoning agent should focus on detailing these steps, and the acting agent should implement them in Isabelle syntax, replacing the 'sorry' commands with actual proof steps.",
