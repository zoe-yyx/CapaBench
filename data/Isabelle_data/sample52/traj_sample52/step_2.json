Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication (A → B)\n   - A is a conjunction of two bi-implications\n   - B is a bi-implication of two conjunctions\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'intro' method to introduce the antecedent as an assumption\n   - Apply 'rule iffI' to split the consequent into two implications\n\n3. Prove the left-to-right direction:\n   - Assume P1 ∧ Q1\n   - Use 'conjE' to separate P1 and Q1\n   - Use the assumptions from the antecedent to prove P2 and Q2\n   - Combine P2 and Q2 using 'conjI'\n\n4. Prove the right-to-left direction:\n   - Assume P2 ∧ Q2\n   - Use 'conjE' to separate P2 and Q2\n   - Use the assumptions from the antecedent to prove P1 and Q1\n   - Combine P1 and Q1 using 'conjI'\n\n5. Finalize the proof:\n   - The bi-implication should be proven by showing both directions\n\n6. Consider using automation:\n   - After setting up the basic structure, try using 'auto' or 'blast' to complete parts of the proof\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all assumptions are used\n   - Verify that the proof structure matches the theorem structure\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo address the timeout issue while maintaining the logical structure of the proof, we should simplify and streamline our approach. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start with the same basic structure: introduce the assumption and use 'rule iffI' to split the bi-implication.\n\n2. For each direction of the proof:\n   a) Use 'case' to introduce the assumption (P1 ∧ Q1 or P2 ∧ Q2).\n   b) Instead of manually breaking down the conjunctions and equivalences, use 'simp' or 'auto' with the assumptions to simplify the goal.\n   c) If 'simp' or 'auto' doesn't completely solve the goal, finish with 'blast' to attempt automatic proof completion.\n\n3. Use the 'qed' command at the end to close the proof.\n\nThis approach maintains the logical flow of the original proof but leverages Isabelle's automated reasoning capabilities to reduce the number of manual steps, potentially avoiding the timeout issue.\n\nIf this streamlined approach still encounters issues, we may need to consider using even more powerful automation tactics or restructuring the proof further.\n",
