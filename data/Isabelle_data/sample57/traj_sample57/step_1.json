Start the proof\n   b. Apply the definition of tree_reverse\n   c. Observe that the equation matches exactly with the goal\n   d. Conclude the proof\n\n4. Consider potential proof methods:\n   - Use 'simp' (simplification) as it should be sufficient for this simple case\n   - Alternatively, consider using 'auto' if 'simp' doesn't work\n\n5. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be straightforward, but be ready to expand definitions if needed\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a syntax error in the function definition, not a problem with the proof itself. To proceed with proving the theorem, we need to first correct the function definition. Here's what we should do:\n\n1. Modify the type signature of the tree_reverse function:\n   Replace the unicode arrow \"â‡’\" with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\".\n   The corrected line should look like this:\n   fun tree_reverse :: \"tree => tree\" where\n\n2. After fixing this syntax error, we can proceed with the original proof strategy.\n\n3. Use the 'simp' method to prove the theorem, as it should be sufficient for this simple case.\n   The proof should look like this:\n   lemma Leaf_tree_reverse: \"tree_reverse Leaf = Leaf\"\n     by simp\n\n4. If 'simp' doesn't work for any reason, we can try 'auto' as an alternative.\n\n5. Once the proof is successful, we can conclude the theory.\n\nThis approach should resolve the lexical error and allow us to prove the theorem as initially planned.\n",
