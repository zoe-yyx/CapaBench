    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for tree_example2a_height:\n\n1. Understand the problem structure:\n   - Recognize the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Note the specific tree structure of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Understand the 'tree_height' function definition\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Apply the 'tree_height' function to the expanded tree structure\n\n3. Calculate heights step-by-step:\n   a. Calculate heights of leaf nodes\n   b. Calculate heights of inner nodes\n   c. Calculate the final height of the root node\n\n4. Apply simplification:\n   - Use simplification rules to reduce complex expressions\n\n5. Use equality reasoning:\n   - Show that the calculated height equals 2\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Summarize the steps to show that tree_height tree_example2a = 2\n\nThis plan focuses on systematically expanding definitions, calculating heights bottom-up, and using simplification to reach the desired conclusion. It provides a clear path for the player to follow in constructing the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary focus for the next action should be to correct the syntax error in the tree_height function definition. This error is preventing Isabelle from parsing the type correctly, which is a crucial first step in proving the theorem. \n\nSpecifically, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Locate the tree_height function definition in the theory file.\n2. Replace the incorrect arrow symbol \"→\" with the correct Isabelle arrow \"⇒\".\n3. The corrected line should read:\n   fun tree_height :: \"tree ⇒ int\" where\n\nThis small but critical change will allow Isabelle to properly parse the type definition. Once this syntax error is corrected, the proof structure that has already been laid out should be able to proceed without further issues.\n\nAfter making this correction, the acting agent should attempt to run the proof again. If successful, the proof should proceed as previously structured, systematically expanding definitions, calculating heights bottom-up, and using simplification to reach the desired conclusion that tree_height tree_example2a = 2.\n\nIt's important to note that while this syntax correction is the immediate priority, the acting agent should also be vigilant for any other potential syntax issues in the future steps of the proof. Ensuring correct Isabelle syntax throughout the proof will prevent similar parsing errors and allow for smooth progression through the proof steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The syntax error persists due to an incompatible Unicode arrow symbol being used in the function type definition.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\" in the tree_height function definition to ensure proper parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThe current result is still unsatisfactory because the syntax error in the tree_height function definition has not been resolved. The previous action attempted to correct the arrow symbol, but it seems that the Unicode symbol \"⇒\" is not recognized or compatible with the current Isabelle setup.\n\nTo improve the next steps, we should focus on using ASCII symbols that are universally recognized by Isabelle. Specifically, we should replace the Unicode arrow \"⇒\" with its ASCII equivalent \"=>\". This change should resolve the parsing issue and allow Isabelle to properly interpret the function type definition.\n\nFor the next action, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Locate the tree_height function definition in the theory file.\n2. Replace the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the ASCII arrow \"=>\".\n3. The corrected line should read:\n   fun tree_height :: \"tree => int\" where\n\nAfter making this correction, the acting agent should attempt to run the proof again. This change should allow Isabelle to parse the type definition correctly, enabling the proof to proceed as structured.\n\nMoving forward, it's important to be consistent in using ASCII symbols for Isabelle syntax to avoid similar parsing errors. This approach will ensure better compatibility across different Isabelle environments and prevent potential issues with Unicode interpretation.",
