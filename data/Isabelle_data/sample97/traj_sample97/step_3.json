    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for tree_example2a_height:\n\n1. Understand the problem structure:\n   - Recognize the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Note the specific tree structure of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Understand the 'tree_height' function definition\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Apply the 'tree_height' function to the expanded tree structure\n\n3. Calculate heights step-by-step:\n   a. Calculate heights of leaf nodes\n   b. Calculate heights of inner nodes\n   c. Calculate the final height of the root node\n\n4. Apply simplification:\n   - Use simplification rules to reduce complex expressions\n\n5. Use equality reasoning:\n   - Show that the calculated height equals 2\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Summarize the steps to show that tree_height tree_example2a = 2\n\nThis plan focuses on systematically expanding definitions, calculating heights bottom-up, and using simplification to reach the desired conclusion. It provides a clear path for the player to follow in constructing the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue preventing the proof from proceeding is a syntax error in the tree_height function definition. Specifically, the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" is causing a parsing error. To resolve this, we need to replace it with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\", which is universally recognized by Isabelle.\n\nOur next step should focus on correcting this syntax error:\n\n1. Locate the tree_height function definition in the theory file.\n2. Replace the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the ASCII arrow \"=>\".\n3. The corrected line should read:\n   fun tree_height :: \"tree => int\" where\n\nThis change is crucial because:\na) It addresses the immediate parsing error that's blocking the proof.\nb) It ensures compatibility across different Isabelle environments.\nc) It allows the proof to proceed as originally structured.\n\nAfter making this correction, we should be able to run the proof again. The existing proof structure seems correct and well-thought-out, so once this syntax issue is resolved, we expect the proof to proceed smoothly.\n\nIn the future, we should consistently use ASCII symbols for Isabelle syntax to avoid similar parsing errors and ensure better compatibility.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error message indicates a database constraint issue, which is unrelated to the proof itself and likely stems from an environment or configuration problem.\nImprovement: We should focus on verifying the Isabelle environment setup and database configuration, ensuring that the session information is correctly managed and unique constraints are not violated.\n```\n\nThe current error is not directly related to the proof or the Isabelle code we've written. Instead, it appears to be an issue with the underlying database that Isabelle uses to manage session information. This is likely an environment or configuration problem rather than an issue with our proof strategy or syntax.\n\nTo address this:\n\n1. We should first ensure that the Isabelle environment is correctly set up and that there are no conflicting sessions or remnants from previous attempts.\n\n2. It might be helpful to try clearing any cached session information or restarting the Isabelle environment completely.\n\n3. If the problem persists, we may need to consult the Isabelle documentation or support channels for guidance on resolving SQLite database constraints.\n\n4. In the meantime, we can verify that our proof is correct by trying to run it in a different Isabelle environment or instance, if possible.\n\n5. We should also double-check that we don't have any duplicate theory names or conflicting session configurations that might be causing this unique constraint violation.\n\nFor the next steps, we should:\n\n1. Attempt to run the proof in a clean Isabelle environment.\n2. If the error persists, investigate the Isabelle configuration and session management settings.\n3. Consider reaching out to Isabelle support or community forums if the database issue cannot be resolved through standard means.\n\nIt's important to note that the proof itself appears to be correct and well-structured. The issue we're facing is external to the proof content, so once the environment issue is resolved, we expect the proof to be successfully verified.",
