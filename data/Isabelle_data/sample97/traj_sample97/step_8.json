    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for tree_example2a_height:\n\n1. Understand the problem structure:\n   - Recognize the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Note the specific tree structure of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Understand the 'tree_height' function definition\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Apply the 'tree_height' function to the expanded tree structure\n\n3. Calculate heights step-by-step:\n   a. Calculate heights of leaf nodes\n   b. Calculate heights of inner nodes\n   c. Calculate the final height of the root node\n\n4. Apply simplification:\n   - Use simplification rules to reduce complex expressions\n\n5. Use equality reasoning:\n   - Show that the calculated height equals 2\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Summarize the steps to show that tree_height tree_example2a = 2\n\nThis plan focuses on systematically expanding definitions, calculating heights bottom-up, and using simplification to reach the desired conclusion. It provides a clear path for the player to follow in constructing the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe primary issue we're facing is a syntax error in the function definition. The Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) used in the 'tree_height' function definition is not recognized by Isabelle, causing a lexical error. To resolve this and proceed with the proof, we need to:\n\n1. Correct the syntax: Replace the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the standard ASCII arrow (=>) in the 'tree_height' function definition. This should be done on line 10 of the \"TreeExample2aHeight.thy\" file.\n\n2. Review the entire proof: After making this correction, we should carefully review the rest of the proof to ensure there are no other instances of Unicode symbols that might cause similar issues.\n\n3. Rerun the proof: Once the syntax is corrected, we should attempt to run the proof again. The current proof strategy using 'simp add: tree_example2a_def' is correct and should work once the syntax error is resolved.\n\n4. Verify each step: As we proceed, we should verify that each step of the proof is executed correctly, paying close attention to any error messages that might indicate further issues.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and successfully prove the theorem. The focus should be on ensuring syntactic correctness while maintaining the logical structure of the proof.\n",
