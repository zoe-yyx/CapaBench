    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for tree_example2a_height:\n\n1. Understand the problem structure:\n   - Recognize the datatype 'tree' definition\n   - Note the specific tree structure of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Understand the 'tree_height' function definition\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of 'tree_example2a'\n   - Apply the 'tree_height' function to the expanded tree structure\n\n3. Calculate heights step-by-step:\n   a. Calculate heights of leaf nodes\n   b. Calculate heights of inner nodes\n   c. Calculate the final height of the root node\n\n4. Apply simplification:\n   - Use simplification rules to reduce complex expressions\n\n5. Use equality reasoning:\n   - Show that the calculated height equals 2\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Summarize the steps to show that tree_height tree_example2a = 2\n\nThis plan focuses on systematically expanding definitions, calculating heights bottom-up, and using simplification to reach the desired conclusion. It provides a clear path for the player to follow in constructing the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and planning strategy, our reasoning for the next step should focus on initiating the proof process. Here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent:\n\n1. We should start by expanding the definition of tree_example2a. This will give us the explicit structure of the tree we're working with.\n\n2. After expanding the definition, we should apply the tree_height function to this expanded structure. This will allow us to see how the function calculates the height for this specific tree.\n\n3. Once we have applied tree_height to the expanded tree structure, we can begin calculating the heights step-by-step, starting from the leaf nodes and working our way up to the root.\n\n4. As we calculate, we should use simplification rules to reduce complex expressions. This will make our calculations clearer and easier to follow.\n\n5. Throughout this process, we should keep in mind that our goal is to show that the final calculated height equals 2.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by using the 'unfold' tactic to expand the definition of tree_example2a, followed by applying the tree_height function to this expanded structure. This will set up the foundation for our step-by-step height calculation.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered a lexical error due to the use of an incorrect arrow symbol (⇒) in the type definition of the tree_height function.\n\nImprovement: Replace the incorrect arrow symbol (⇒) with the correct one (→) in the type definition of the tree_height function to resolve the lexical error and allow the proof to proceed.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the main issue preventing progress is a syntax error in the function definition. The use of the incorrect arrow symbol is causing the Isabelle/HOL parser to fail, which is blocking any further proof attempts.\n\nTo improve the situation, we need to correct this syntax error first. Once this is fixed, we can then proceed with the proof strategy outlined in the previous thought. This includes expanding the definition of tree_example2a, applying the tree_height function, and then calculating the height step-by-step.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the proof ended with a 'sorry' statement, which we should aim to replace with a complete proof once the syntax error is resolved. The reasoning and acting agents should focus on providing a step-by-step calculation of the tree height, showing explicitly how it evaluates to 2 for the given tree structure.\n\nIn future steps, we should pay closer attention to syntax details, especially when defining functions or types, to avoid similar errors that can impede the proving process.",
