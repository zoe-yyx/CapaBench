    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The problem involves proving that \"plus_one 1 = 2\".\n   - The 'plus_one' function is defined as \"plus_one x = x + 1\".\n\n2. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Unfold the definition of 'plus_one'.\n   b. Simplify the resulting expression.\n   c. Verify the equality.\n\n3. Detailed Steps:\n   a. Use the 'unfold' method to expand the definition of 'plus_one'.\n   b. Apply simplification (simp) to evaluate the arithmetic.\n   c. The proof should complete automatically after simplification.\n\n4. Potential Methods to Use:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of 'plus_one'.\n   - simp: For simplification and arithmetic evaluation.\n\n5. Expected Outcome:\n   - After unfolding and simplification, we should directly obtain \"1 + 1 = 2\".\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that the final proof state shows the desired equality \"2 = 2\".\n\n7. Potential Challenges:\n   - This proof is straightforward, so no significant challenges are expected.\n   - If simplification doesn't complete the proof, consider using 'eval' or manual arithmetic reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the problem description and the planning strategy, we should start by unfolding the definition of 'plus_one' and then simplify the resulting expression. This approach aligns with the outlined proof strategy and should lead us directly to the desired result.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The lemma \"One_plus_one\" states that \"plus_one 1 = 2\".\n2. We need to expand the left-hand side of this equality using the definition of 'plus_one'.\n3. After expansion, we expect to see \"1 + 1 = 2\".\n4. Simple arithmetic evaluation should then complete the proof.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following steps for the acting agent:\n1. Start the proof by using the 'unfold' method to expand the definition of 'plus_one'.\n2. Follow immediately with the 'simp' method to simplify the resulting expression.\n\nThis combination of 'unfold' and 'simp' should be sufficient to prove the lemma in one step. If successful, the proof should be completed without requiring any further steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The use of Unicode arrow (⇒) in the type definition caused a lexical error, preventing successful parsing of the theory file.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow (⇒) with the ASCII representation (=>) in the type definition to ensure proper parsing and avoid lexical errors.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the core issue lies in the use of a Unicode character that Isabelle's parser couldn't handle properly. The improvement suggests a simple but crucial change to use the ASCII representation of the arrow, which should resolve the parsing error.\n\nFor future steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Modify the type definition line to use the ASCII arrow:\n   `definition plus_one :: \"int => int\" where`\n\n2. Keep the rest of the proof structure as it is, as the proof steps themselves appear to be correct and well-structured.\n\n3. After making this change, attempt to run the proof again.\n\nThis adjustment should allow the theory file to be parsed correctly, enabling the proof to proceed. The overall strategy for proving the lemma remains sound, so once the parsing issue is resolved, the proof should go through successfully.\n\nIt's important to note that while Unicode characters are often supported in Isabelle, using ASCII representations for symbols like arrows can help avoid potential compatibility issues across different environments or versions of Isabelle.",
