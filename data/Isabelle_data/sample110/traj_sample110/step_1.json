    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The problem involves proving that \"plus_one 1 = 2\".\n   - The 'plus_one' function is defined as \"plus_one x = x + 1\".\n\n2. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a. Unfold the definition of 'plus_one'.\n   b. Simplify the resulting expression.\n   c. Verify the equality.\n\n3. Detailed Steps:\n   a. Use the 'unfold' method to expand the definition of 'plus_one'.\n   b. Apply simplification (simp) to evaluate the arithmetic.\n   c. The proof should complete automatically after simplification.\n\n4. Potential Methods to Use:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of 'plus_one'.\n   - simp: For simplification and arithmetic evaluation.\n\n5. Expected Outcome:\n   - After unfolding and simplification, we should directly obtain \"1 + 1 = 2\".\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that the final proof state shows the desired equality \"2 = 2\".\n\n7. Potential Challenges:\n   - This proof is straightforward, so no significant challenges are expected.\n   - If simplification doesn't complete the proof, consider using 'eval' or manual arithmetic reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current issue is a lexical error caused by the use of a Unicode arrow (⇒) in the type definition. To resolve this, we need to modify the type definition to use the ASCII representation of the arrow (=>). This change should allow the theory file to be parsed correctly without altering the logic or structure of the proof.\n\nThe reasoning for the next steps is as follows:\n\n1. Modify the type definition:\n   Replace \"int ⇒ int\" with \"int => int\" in the definition of plus_one.\n\n2. Keep the existing proof structure:\n   The proof steps already written are logically correct and well-structured. They follow the planned strategy of unfolding the definition and using simplification.\n\n3. Re-run the proof:\n   After making the modification, the entire proof should be executed again.\n\nThe expected outcome is that the lexical error will be resolved, allowing the parser to process the theory file successfully. The proof itself should then proceed without issues, as the logic and structure are sound.\n\nIf any further issues arise after this change, we should carefully examine the output for any new error messages or unexpected behavior. However, given that the only apparent problem was the Unicode arrow, this change should be sufficient to allow the proof to complete successfully.\n",
