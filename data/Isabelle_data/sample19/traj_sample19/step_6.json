    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for fixpoint_self_comp:\n\n1. Understand the given definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of Zcomp (function composition)\n   - Understand the definition of is_fixpoint\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - Identify the assumption: \"is_fixpoint f x\"\n   - Identify the conclusion: \"is_fixpoint (Zcomp f f) x\"\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of is_fixpoint in both the assumption and conclusion\n   - Expand the definition of Zcomp in the conclusion\n\n4. Prove the theorem:\n   a. Start with the assumption: f x = x\n   b. Show that (Zcomp f f) x = x:\n      - Apply the definition of Zcomp\n      - Use the assumption to simplify\n   c. Conclude that this matches the definition of is_fixpoint for (Zcomp f f)\n\n5. Key steps in the proof:\n   - Use the 'unfold' tactic to expand definitions\n   - Apply the assumption using 'assumption' or 'simp'\n   - Use basic equality reasoning\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly expanding nested function applications\n   - Ensuring all necessary definitions are unfolded\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous\n   - Ensure the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the fixpoint_self_comp theorem, focusing on understanding the definitions, breaking down the problem, and systematically applying logical steps to reach the conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the lexical error encountered due to the use of Unicode arrow symbols (⇒), our primary focus should be on modifying the type definitions and any occurrences of these symbols throughout the proof. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Replace Unicode symbols with ASCII equivalents:\n   - Change all instances of \"⇒\" to \"=>\" in type definitions and throughout the proof.\n   - This includes the definitions of Zcomp and is_fixpoint, as well as any occurrences in the theorem statement or proof body.\n\n2. Maintain the logical structure of the proof:\n   - The proof structure itself appears to be correct, so we should preserve it after making the symbol replacements.\n\n3. Recheck definitions:\n   - After replacing the symbols, double-check that the definitions of Zcomp and is_fixpoint are correctly stated with the new ASCII symbols.\n\n4. Verify theorem statement:\n   - Ensure that the theorem statement for fixpoint_self_comp is updated with the correct ASCII symbols.\n\n5. Review proof steps:\n   - Go through each step of the proof, making sure that all references to functions and their applications use the correct ASCII notation.\n\n6. Re-run the proof:\n   - Once all modifications are made, attempt to run the entire proof again from the beginning.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to resolve the parsing issue while maintaining the logical integrity of the proof. The acting agent should focus on systematically replacing the Unicode symbols and then re-executing the proof to verify its correctness.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof execution encountered a database-related error, likely due to concurrent access or a locked database file, which prevented the successful completion of the proof.\n\nImprovement: Ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up with exclusive access to the database, and consider implementing a retry mechanism with appropriate delays to handle temporary database locks.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current issue is not related to the proof itself, but rather to the Isabelle environment and its database management. The proof structure and content appear to be correct after the previous modifications to replace Unicode symbols with ASCII equivalents.\n\nTo address this issue and improve future actions:\n\n1. Environment setup:\n   - Verify that the Isabelle installation is up-to-date and properly configured.\n   - Ensure that no other Isabelle processes are running concurrently that might be locking the database.\n\n2. Database management:\n   - Consider implementing a mechanism to retry the proof execution after a short delay if a database lock is encountered.\n   - If possible, investigate ways to optimize database access or reduce contention in the Isabelle environment.\n\n3. Error handling:\n   - Implement more robust error handling in the proof execution process to catch and appropriately respond to database-related errors.\n\n4. Proof preservation:\n   - Since the proof itself seems correct, ensure that it is saved and can be easily reloaded for future attempts.\n\n5. Alternative proof methods:\n   - If database issues persist, consider breaking down the proof into smaller, more manageable chunks that might be less likely to encounter database locks.\n\n6. System resources:\n   - Check if the system has sufficient resources (memory, disk space) to handle the Isabelle processes efficiently.\n\nFor the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on addressing these environmental and database-related issues rather than modifying the proof itself. Once these technical hurdles are overcome, the proof should be able to execute successfully.",
