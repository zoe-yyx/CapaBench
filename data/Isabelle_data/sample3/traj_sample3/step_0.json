Analyze the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem \"or_introl\"\n   - We need to show that if A is true, then \"A ∨ B\" is true\n   - This is a basic logical property of disjunction (OR)\n\n2. Identify Key Components:\n   - Fixes: A and B are of type bool\n   - Assumption (H): A is true\n   - Goal: A ∨ B\n\n3. Outline Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the assumption that A is true\n   - Apply the definition of disjunction (OR)\n   - Show that if the left side of a disjunction is true, the entire disjunction is true\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the assumption that A is true\n   b. Use the disjunction introduction rule for the left side (∨-intro1)\n   c. This should directly prove that A ∨ B is true\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by applying the core strategy outlined in the planning phase. The key insight here is that we have an assumption H that A is true, and we need to show that A ∨ B is true.\n\nThe most direct way to prove this is to use the disjunction introduction rule for the left side, which states that if A is true, then A ∨ B is true for any B. This rule is typically called disjI1 in Isabelle.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step would be to apply this rule. The acting agent should use a tactic that applies the disjI1 rule, which will immediately prove the goal using the assumption H.\n\nThis approach aligns with steps 4a and 4b in our planning strategy and should be sufficient to complete the proof in a single step, given the simplicity of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof was correctly constructed, but an external database error occurred, preventing successful certification.\n\nImprovement: Retry the proof submission, ensuring the database is accessible and not experiencing conflicts, while maintaining the correct proof structure.\n```\n\nReflecting on the current situation, it's important to note that the proof itself appears to be correct and follows the planned strategy effectively. The use of the disjI1 rule to prove the theorem is appropriate and aligns with our initial thought process.\n\nThe error message indicates an issue with the SQLite database used by Isabelle for session management, rather than a problem with the proof itself. This is likely an environmental or system-level issue, not related to the logical structure of our proof.\n\nMoving forward, we should:\n\n1. Verify that the Isabelle environment is set up correctly and that there are no conflicts with existing session data.\n2. Ensure that the acting agent has the necessary permissions to write to the database.\n3. If the issue persists, consider clearing any cached session data or restarting the Isabelle environment.\n4. Maintain the current proof structure, as it is logically sound and concise.\n\nThe reasoning and action steps were correct, so we don't need to modify our approach to the proof itself. The focus should be on resolving the external database issue to allow successful certification of the proof.\n\nIn terms of the overall goal, we are on the right track with the proof. Once the database issue is resolved, this proof should be accepted without further modifications. The use of 'sorry' was correctly avoided, and the proof is rigorous and complete as it stands.",
