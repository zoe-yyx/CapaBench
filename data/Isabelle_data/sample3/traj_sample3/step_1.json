    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem \"or_introl\"\n   - We need to show that if A is true, then \"A ∨ B\" is true\n   - This is a basic logical property of disjunction (OR)\n\n2. Identify Key Components:\n   - Fixes: A and B are of type bool\n   - Assumption (H): A is true\n   - Goal: A ∨ B\n\n3. Outline Proof Strategy:\n   - Use the assumption that A is true\n   - Apply the definition of disjunction (OR)\n   - Show that if the left side of a disjunction is true, the entire disjunction is true\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with the assumption that A is true\n   b. Use the disjunction introduction rule for the left side (∨-intro1)\n   c. This should directly prove that A ∨ B is true\n\n5. Potential Tactics:\n   - apply (rule disjI1)\n   - using the assumption H\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that the proof is complete and accepted by Isabelle\n   - Check that no additional assumptions were introduced\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates a fundamental property of logical disjunction\n   - It shows that if one part of an OR statement is true, the entire statement is true\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that the proof structure is correct and follows the planned strategy, but we encountered a database-related error, our reasoning for the next step should focus on addressing the technical issue while maintaining the integrity of the proof. Here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent:\n\n1. The proof structure is logically sound and does not require modification. It correctly uses the disjI1 rule and the given assumption H to prove the theorem.\n\n2. The error message suggests a database constraint issue, which is external to the proof itself. This could be due to a conflict in session management or permissions.\n\n3. To resolve this, we should first attempt to resubmit the proof without changes. Sometimes, transient database issues can resolve themselves on a subsequent attempt.\n\n4. If the error persists, we should consider the following steps:\n   a. Verify that the Isabelle environment is properly configured and that there are no conflicts with existing session data.\n   b. Ensure that the acting agent has the necessary permissions to write to the database.\n   c. If possible, clear any cached session data or restart the Isabelle environment.\n\n5. Throughout this process, it's crucial to maintain the current proof structure as it is correct and concise.\n\n6. Once the technical issue is resolved, the proof should be accepted without further logical modifications.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with resubmitting the proof as is, and if the error persists, focus on resolving the database-related issue rather than altering the proof itself.\n",
