    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the \"not_forall_imply\" corollary:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove: \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\" implies \"\\<exists>x. P x \\<and> \\<not> Q x\"\n   - This is a corollary, so we should utilize previously proven theorems\n\n2. Identify relevant theorems:\n   - not_forall: \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. P x)\" implies \"\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x\"\n   - not_imply_iff: \"\\<not> (P \\<longrightarrow> Q)\" implies \"P \\<and> \\<not> Q\"\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a) Start with the assumption \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\"\n   b) Apply the not_forall theorem to this assumption\n   c) Use the result to show the existence of an x where \\<not>(P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\n   d) Apply the not_imply_iff theorem to this result\n   e) Conclude that there exists an x where P x \\<and> \\<not> Q x\n\n4. Key steps in the proof:\n   - Use the not_forall theorem to transform the negation of a universal quantifier into an existential quantifier\n   - Apply not_imply_iff to the result of not_forall to obtain the desired conjunction\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Correctly handling the quantifiers and implications\n   - Ensuring proper application of the theorems\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After each step, verify that the logical transformations are correct\n   - Ensure that the final result matches the required form: \"\\<exists>x. P x \\<and> \\<not> Q x\"\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the corollary, leveraging the previously proven theorems and focusing on the logical transformations needed to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, our reasoning should focus on the following points:\n\n1. Proof Correctness: The proof strategy and implementation for the corollary not_forall_imply appear to be logically sound. The proof correctly utilizes the previously proven theorems (not_forall and not_imply_iff) and follows the planned logical steps.\n\n2. System Issues: The errors observed are not related to the proof logic but to system-level database access problems. These issues are preventing the successful execution and verification of the proof.\n\n3. Next Steps: Since the proof itself is correct, the next actions should focus on resolving the technical issues rather than modifying the proof. This includes:\n\n   a) Verifying and correcting database file permissions and locations.\n   b) Ensuring proper setup of the Isabelle environment with necessary access rights.\n   c) Checking for any system-wide issues affecting the Isabelle export process.\n\n4. Proof Verification: Once the technical issues are resolved, the proof should be re-run to verify its correctness in the Isabelle environment.\n\n5. Maintaining Current Approach: The reasoning and acting agents should maintain their current approach to the proof, as it is logically sound and correctly proves the corollary.\n\nIn conclusion, the focus should be on resolving the system-level issues to allow for successful execution and verification of the proof, rather than modifying the proof itself.\n",
