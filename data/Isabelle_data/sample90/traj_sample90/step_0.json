    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the \"not_forall_imply\" corollary:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove: \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\" implies \"\\<exists>x. P x \\<and> \\<not> Q x\"\n   - This is a corollary, so we should utilize previously proven theorems\n\n2. Identify relevant theorems:\n   - not_forall: \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. P x)\" implies \"\\<exists>x. \\<not> P x\"\n   - not_imply_iff: \"\\<not> (P \\<longrightarrow> Q)\" implies \"P \\<and> \\<not> Q\"\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a) Start with the assumption \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\"\n   b) Apply the not_forall theorem to this assumption\n   c) Use the result to show the existence of an x where \\<not>(P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\n   d) Apply the not_imply_iff theorem to this result\n   e) Conclude that there exists an x where P x \\<and> \\<not> Q x\n\n4. Key steps in the proof:\n   - Use the not_forall theorem to transform the negation of a universal quantifier into an existential quantifier\n   - Apply not_imply_iff to the result of not_forall to obtain the desired conjunction\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Correctly handling the quantifiers and implications\n   - Ensuring proper application of the theorems\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After each step, verify that the logical transformations are correct\n   - Ensure that the final result matches the required form: \"\\<exists>x. P x \\<and> \\<not> Q x\"\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the corollary, leveraging the previously proven theorems and focusing on the logical transformations needed to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the corollary not_forall_imply, we should follow these logical steps:\n\n1. Start with the assumption: \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\"\n\n2. Apply the not_forall theorem to this assumption. The not_forall theorem states that if we have \"\\<not> (\\<forall>x. R x)\", then we can conclude \"\\<exists>x. \\<not> R x\". In our case, R x is (P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x). So, applying not_forall will give us:\n   \"\\<exists>x. \\<not> (P x \\<longrightarrow> Q x)\"\n\n3. Now, we can use the not_imply_iff theorem on the result we got from step 2. The not_imply_iff theorem states that \"\\<not> (A \\<longrightarrow> B)\" implies \"A \\<and> \\<not> B\". In our case, A is P x and B is Q x. Applying this theorem will give us:\n   \"\\<exists>x. P x \\<and> \\<not> Q x\"\n\n4. This last statement is exactly what we need to prove for the corollary.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on applying these theorems in the correct order, making sure to handle the quantifiers properly. The proof will likely involve using the 'obtain' command to work with the existential quantifier, and then applying the not_imply_iff theorem to the obtained term.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof was correct, but there were system-level issues preventing the successful execution and verification of the proof.\n\nImprovement: The proof strategy and implementation are sound, so we should focus on resolving the system-level issues, such as database access permissions or file locations, to allow successful execution and verification of the proof.\n```\n\nThe reflection indicates that the proof itself is correct and follows the logical steps outlined in the thought process. The corollary not_forall_imply was proven using the correct theorems (not_forall and not_imply_iff) in the appropriate order.\n\nHowever, the errors observed are not related to the proof itself but to system-level issues, specifically database access problems. These errors suggest that there might be issues with file permissions, database locations, or system configurations that are preventing the successful execution and verification of the proof.\n\nFor future actions, the focus should be on:\n\n1. Verifying and correcting the database file permissions and locations.\n2. Ensuring that the Isabelle environment is properly set up and has the necessary access rights.\n3. Checking for any system-wide issues that might be affecting the Isabelle export process.\n\nOnce these technical issues are resolved, the proof should be able to run successfully, as the logical structure and implementation appear to be correct. The reasoning and acting agents should maintain their current approach to the proof, as it is logically sound and follows the correct steps to prove the corollary.",
