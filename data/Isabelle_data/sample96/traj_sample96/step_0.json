Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that applying plus_one function twice to 1 should result in 3.\n   - The plus_one function is defined as adding 1 to the input.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Expand the definition of plus_one for the outer application\n   b. Expand the definition of plus_one for the inner application\n   c. Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   Step 1: Unfold the outer plus_one definition\n   Step 2: Unfold the inner plus_one definition\n   Step 3: Simplify the arithmetic expression\n   Step 4: Verify the final result equals 3\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of plus_one\n   - simp: To simplify arithmetic expressions\n   - auto: To attempt automatic proof after unfolding definitions\n\n5. Considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward as it involves basic integer arithmetic.\n   - No additional lemmas or theorems seem necessary for this proof.\n   - The definition of plus_one is crucial and should be used twice.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof is clear and follows logically from the previous step.\n   - Check that the final result matches the right-hand side of the equation (3).\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the One_plus_one_plus_one theorem, focusing on unfolding definitions and simplifying arithmetic expressions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem \"One_plus_one_plus_one\", our first step should be to unfold the definition of the plus_one function. This aligns with steps 1 and 2 of our proof outline in the planning strategy.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem statement involves the plus_one function applied twice.\n2. To understand what this means in terms of actual arithmetic operations, we need to expand the definition of plus_one.\n3. We should start with the outermost application of plus_one, as this will allow us to work our way inwards step by step.\n4. Unfolding the definition will replace \"plus_one\" with its actual definition \"x + 1\", which will make the arithmetic more explicit.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the 'unfold' tactic on the plus_one definition. This will transform the left-hand side of our equation, making it more amenable to further simplification in subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a syntax error in the type definition of the plus_one function.\nImprovement: Correct the type definition syntax by replacing \"⇒\" with \"->\" and ensure all special characters are properly encoded in the Isabelle/HOL syntax.\n```\n\nThe current result is unsatisfactory because the proof attempt didn't even begin due to a lexical error in the type definition. This indicates that there was an issue with the basic syntax of the Isabelle/HOL code, specifically in the definition of the plus_one function.\n\nThe error message points to the use of \"⇒\" in the type definition, which is not the correct symbol for function types in Isabelle/HOL. Instead, the correct symbol should be \"->\". This mistake likely occurred due to a misunderstanding of Isabelle's syntax or possibly a character encoding issue.\n\nTo improve in the next steps, we should:\n\n1. Correct the type definition of plus_one to use \"->\" instead of \"⇒\".\n2. Double-check all special characters and symbols to ensure they are properly encoded and recognized by Isabelle.\n3. After fixing the syntax error, proceed with the planned proof strategy, starting with unfolding the definition of plus_one.\n\nIt's important to note that while the current proof attempt uses 'sorry', which is a placeholder for an incomplete proof, our goal is to complete the proof rigorously without relying on 'sorry'. Once the syntax error is fixed, we should focus on providing a complete, step-by-step proof using appropriate Isabelle tactics and methods.\n\nBy addressing these issues, we can align our actions more closely with the overall goal of successfully proving the One_plus_one_plus_one theorem in Isabelle/HOL.",
