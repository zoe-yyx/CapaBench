    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for One_plus_one_plus_one Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that applying plus_one function twice to 1 should result in 3.\n   - The plus_one function is defined as adding 1 to the input.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Expand the definition of plus_one for the outer application\n   b. Expand the definition of plus_one for the inner application\n   c. Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   Step 1: Unfold the outer plus_one definition\n   Step 2: Unfold the inner plus_one definition\n   Step 3: Simplify the arithmetic expression\n   Step 4: Verify the final result equals 3\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of plus_one\n   - simp: To simplify arithmetic expressions\n   - auto: To attempt automatic proof after unfolding definitions\n\n5. Considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward as it involves basic integer arithmetic.\n   - No additional lemmas or theorems seem necessary for this proof.\n   - The definition of plus_one is crucial and should be used twice.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof is clear and follows logically from the previous step.\n   - Check that the final result matches the right-hand side of the equation (3).\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the One_plus_one_plus_one theorem, focusing on unfolding definitions and simplifying arithmetic expressions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The current proof structure is logically sound and complete. It follows the planned strategy of unfolding definitions and simplifying arithmetic expressions.\n\n2. The proof steps are as follows:\n   a. Unfold the inner plus_one definition\n   b. Unfold the outer plus_one definition\n   c. Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n   d. Show the final result equals 3\n\n3. These steps align perfectly with our initial plan and should be sufficient to prove the theorem.\n\n4. The issue preventing successful certification is not within the proof itself, but rather a database constraint error (SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY).\n\n5. Given that the proof is correct, the next actions should focus on resolving the database issue rather than modifying the proof.\n\n6. Potential steps to address the database issue:\n   a. Ensure that the Isabelle session has a unique name\n   b. Clear any conflicting entries in the Isabelle database\n   c. Check Isabelle's configuration for session management issues\n\n7. Once the database issue is resolved, the current proof should be re-attempted as is.\n\n8. If the database issue persists, consider running the proof in a fresh Isabelle environment or with a different session name.\n\n9. Continue to monitor for any syntax or logical errors in the proof itself, but based on the current information, no changes to the proof content are necessary.\n",
