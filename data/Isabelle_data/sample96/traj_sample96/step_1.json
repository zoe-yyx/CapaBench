    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for One_plus_one_plus_one Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that applying plus_one function twice to 1 should result in 3.\n   - The plus_one function is defined as adding 1 to the input.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Expand the definition of plus_one for the outer application\n   b. Expand the definition of plus_one for the inner application\n   c. Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   Step 1: Unfold the outer plus_one definition\n   Step 2: Unfold the inner plus_one definition\n   Step 3: Simplify the arithmetic expression\n   Step 4: Verify the final result equals 3\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of plus_one\n   - simp: To simplify arithmetic expressions\n   - auto: To attempt automatic proof after unfolding definitions\n\n5. Considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward as it involves basic integer arithmetic.\n   - No additional lemmas or theorems seem necessary for this proof.\n   - The definition of plus_one is crucial and should be used twice.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof is clear and follows logically from the previous step.\n   - Check that the final result matches the right-hand side of the equation (3).\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the One_plus_one_plus_one theorem, focusing on unfolding definitions and simplifying arithmetic expressions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The first priority is to correct the syntax error in the type definition of the plus_one function. We need to change \"int â‡’ int\" to \"int -> int\" in the definition.\n\n2. After fixing the syntax, we should proceed with the proof strategy as originally planned. The current proof attempt is on the right track, but it's incomplete.\n\n3. The next step should be to unfold the outer plus_one definition, which has already been done in the current proof attempt. This step is correct and should be kept.\n\n4. Following this, we need to unfold the inner plus_one definition and simplify the resulting arithmetic expression.\n\n5. The final step would be to show that the simplified expression equals 3, which completes the proof.\n\n6. Instead of using 'sorry', we should use appropriate Isabelle tactics to complete each step of the proof.\n\n7. The 'simp' tactic with the plus_one_def seems to be effective, so we can continue using it for the remaining steps.\n\nGiven these considerations, the acting agent should:\n1. Correct the syntax in the definition of plus_one.\n2. Keep the first step of the proof that unfolds the outer plus_one.\n3. Add a step to unfold the inner plus_one and simplify the arithmetic.\n4. Add a final step to show the equality with 3.\n5. Remove the 'sorry' and complete the proof using appropriate tactics.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the provided information, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt is correct, but the issue lies in the database constraint error, which is unrelated to the proof itself.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the database constraint issue, possibly by ensuring unique session names or clearing any conflicting database entries, before re-attempting to process the proof.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current proof strategy is actually sound and complete. The proof steps are logical, well-structured, and do not use 'sorry'. The issue preventing successful certification is not within the proof itself, but rather a database constraint error.\n\nFor future steps:\n\n1. The planning and reasoning agents should investigate the cause of the SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY error. This could be due to a conflict in the Isabelle environment or database setup.\n\n2. The acting agent should focus on resolving this database issue. This may involve:\n   - Ensuring that each Isabelle session has a unique name\n   - Clearing any conflicting entries in the database\n   - Checking Isabelle's configuration for any issues related to session management\n\n3. Once the database issue is resolved, the current proof should be re-attempted as is, since it appears to be correct and complete.\n\n4. If the database issue persists, consider running the proof in a fresh Isabelle environment or with a different session name.\n\n5. Keep monitoring for any syntax or logical errors in the proof itself, but based on the current information, the proof structure seems correct.\n\nThe key takeaway is that sometimes issues in theorem proving can stem from the environment or tool setup rather than the proof itself. Always consider both the logical content of the proof and the technical environment in which it's being processed.",
