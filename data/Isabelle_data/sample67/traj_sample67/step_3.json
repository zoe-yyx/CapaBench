    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem \"iff_imply\"\n   - The theorem states: \"(P ⟷ Q) ⟹ (P → Q)\"\n   - We need to show that if P and Q are equivalent (iff), then P implies Q\n\n2. Identify the logical structure:\n   - The theorem has an implication (⟹) as the main connective\n   - The left side of the implication is a bi-implication (⟷)\n   - The right side is a simple implication (→)\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   - Use the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\" as our starting point\n   - Break down the bi-implication into its constituent parts\n   - Use these parts to prove the implication \"P → Q\"\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\"\n   b. Use the definition of bi-implication to split it into two parts:\n      - (P → Q) and (Q → P)\n   c. Focus on the (P → Q) part, as this is exactly what we need to prove\n   d. Conclude that (P → Q) holds directly from the assumption\n\n5. Consider potential proof techniques:\n   - Direct proof using the assumption\n   - Possibly use the \"unfold\" tactic to expand the definition of ⟷\n   - Use the \"assumption\" tactic to complete the proof\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the bi-implication operator\n   - Be ready to justify each step if needed\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward\n   - The key insight is recognizing that (P ⟷ Q) already contains (P → Q)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe main issue we're facing is the incorrect representation of logical symbols in Isabelle. To address this, we need to use the correct Isabelle-specific ASCII representations for logical operators. Here's how we should proceed:\n\n1. Rewrite the lemma statement using the correct Isabelle syntax:\n   lemma iff_imply: \"(P \\<longleftrightarrow> Q) \\<Longrightarrow> (P \\<longrightarrow> Q)\"\n\n2. For the proof, we should start with a simple approach using Isabelle's apply-style proof method. This method is often more straightforward for beginners and can help us focus on the logical steps without worrying too much about the syntax of a structured proof.\n\n3. The proof strategy should be:\n   a. Assume the left-hand side of the implication\n   b. Use the definition of bi-implication to extract the needed implication\n   c. Apply this implication to prove the goal\n\n4. We should use the following tactics:\n   - 'apply (rule impI)' to introduce the implication\n   - 'apply (erule iffD1)' to extract the forward direction of the bi-implication\n   - 'apply assumption' to complete the proof\n\n5. After each step, we should check the proof state to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n6. Once the proof is complete, we can use 'done' to finish it.\n\nThis approach should allow us to prove the lemma while avoiding syntax errors related to logical symbols. If any issues persist, we should carefully review each line for correct Isabelle syntax before proceeding.\n",
