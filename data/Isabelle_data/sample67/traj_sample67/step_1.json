    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem \"iff_imply\"\n   - The theorem states: \"(P ⟷ Q) ⟹ (P → Q)\"\n   - We need to show that if P and Q are equivalent (iff), then P implies Q\n\n2. Identify the logical structure:\n   - The theorem has an implication (⟹) as the main connective\n   - The left side of the implication is a bi-implication (⟷)\n   - The right side is a simple implication (→)\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   - Use the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\" as our starting point\n   - Break down the bi-implication into its constituent parts\n   - Use these parts to prove the implication \"P → Q\"\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\"\n   b. Use the definition of bi-implication to split it into two parts:\n      - (P → Q) and (Q → P)\n   c. Focus on the (P → Q) part, as this is exactly what we need to prove\n   d. Conclude that (P → Q) holds directly from the assumption\n\n5. Consider potential proof techniques:\n   - Direct proof using the assumption\n   - Possibly use the \"unfold\" tactic to expand the definition of ⟷\n   - Use the \"assumption\" tactic to complete the proof\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the bi-implication operator\n   - Be ready to justify each step if needed\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward\n   - The key insight is recognizing that (P ⟷ Q) already contains (P → Q)\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Symbol Conversion: The primary issue is the use of Unicode symbols that Isabelle is unable to parse. We need to convert these symbols to their ASCII equivalents:\n   - Replace \"⟷\" with \"<->\"\n   - Replace \"→\" with \"-->\"\n   - Replace \"⟹\" with \"==>\"\n\n2. Theorem Restatement: The theorem should be restated using ASCII symbols:\n   lemma iff_imply: \"(P <-> Q) ==> (P --> Q)\"\n\n3. Proof Structure: The overall structure of the proof is correct. We should maintain this structure but update the symbols within it.\n\n4. Proof Steps: The proof steps should be adjusted as follows:\n   a. Start with the assumption: assume \"P <-> Q\"\n   b. Break down the bi-implication: then have \"(P --> Q) & (Q --> P)\" by simp\n   c. Extract the implication we need: then have \"P --> Q\" by simp\n   d. Conclude the proof: thus \"P --> Q\" by assumption\n\n5. Simplification: The use of 'simp' for breaking down the bi-implication and extracting the implication is appropriate and should be maintained.\n\n6. Final Step: The use of 'thus' and 'by assumption' for the conclusion is correct and should be kept.\n\n7. Overall Approach: The direct proof approach using the assumption and breaking it down is the most straightforward way to prove this theorem. This approach should be continued.\n\nGiven these considerations, the acting agent should rewrite the proof using ASCII symbols while maintaining the same logical structure and proof steps. This should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to process the proof correctly.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The ASCII conversion of logical symbols was incorrect, leading to parsing errors in Isabelle.\n\nImprovement: Use the correct ASCII representations for logical symbols: \"<->\" for bi-implication, \"-->\" for implication, and \"==>\" for meta-implication.\n```\n\nReflecting on the current outcome, it's clear that the main issue lies in the incorrect ASCII representation of logical symbols. While we correctly identified the need to convert Unicode symbols to ASCII, the actual conversion was not accurate. This led to Isabelle being unable to parse the proposition correctly.\n\nThe correct ASCII representations for the logical symbols are:\n- \"<->\" for bi-implication (↔)\n- \"-->\" for implication (→)\n- \"==>\" for meta-implication (⟹)\n\nIn our attempt, we used \"<- >\" (with a space) for bi-implication, which is incorrect and caused the parsing error. We need to ensure that there are no spaces within the symbol representations.\n\nFor future actions, we should:\n\n1. Double-check all symbol conversions to ensure they match Isabelle's expected syntax.\n2. Be particularly careful with bi-implication (\"<->\") to ensure there's no space between the characters.\n3. Maintain the correct logical structure of the proof, which was sound in our previous attempt.\n4. Keep the proof steps as they were, as the logical reasoning was correct; only the symbol representation needs adjustment.\n\nBy making these improvements, we should be able to present a proof that Isabelle can parse and verify correctly. The acting agent should rewrite the lemma and proof with the correct ASCII representations, maintaining the same logical structure and steps as before.",
