    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem \"iff_imply\"\n   - The theorem states: \"(P ⟷ Q) ⟹ (P → Q)\"\n   - We need to show that if P and Q are equivalent (iff), then P implies Q\n\n2. Identify the logical structure:\n   - The theorem has an implication (⟹) as the main connective\n   - The left side of the implication is a bi-implication (⟷)\n   - The right side is a simple implication (→)\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   - Use the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\" as our starting point\n   - Break down the bi-implication into its constituent parts\n   - Use these parts to prove the implication \"P → Q\"\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\"\n   b. Use the definition of bi-implication to split it into two parts:\n      - (P → Q) and (Q → P)\n   c. Focus on the (P → Q) part, as this is exactly what we need to prove\n   d. Conclude that (P → Q) holds directly from the assumption\n\n5. Consider potential proof techniques:\n   - Direct proof using the assumption\n   - Possibly use the \"unfold\" tactic to expand the definition of ⟷\n   - Use the \"assumption\" tactic to complete the proof\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the bi-implication operator\n   - Be ready to justify each step if needed\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward\n   - The key insight is recognizing that (P ⟷ Q) already contains (P → Q)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe theorem we need to prove is \"(P ⟷ Q) ⟹ (P → Q)\". Our strategy will be to use a direct proof approach, leveraging the definition of the bi-implication operator.\n\nReasoning steps:\n\n1. We should start by stating the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\". This will be our starting point.\n\n2. The bi-implication operator \"⟷\" is defined as a conjunction of two implications. Specifically, \"P ⟷ Q\" is equivalent to \"(P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)\".\n\n3. Given this definition, we can break down our assumption into these two parts:\n   a. P → Q\n   b. Q → P\n\n4. Interestingly, the first part (P → Q) is exactly what we need to prove as our conclusion.\n\n5. Therefore, once we've broken down the bi-implication, we can directly use the first part as our proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should focus on:\n1. Introducing the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\"\n2. Breaking down this bi-implication into its constituent parts\n3. Identifying that one of these parts is precisely our goal\n4. Using this part to conclude the proof\n\nThe proof should be relatively straightforward and can likely be completed using basic Isabelle tactics such as 'intro', 'elim', and possibly 'simp' or 'auto' if needed.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof contains Unicode symbols that Isabelle may not recognize, leading to a lexical error.\n\nImprovement: Replace Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents in the theorem statement and proof steps to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is that the proof uses Unicode symbols like \"⟷\" and \"→\", which Isabelle might not be able to parse correctly. This is causing a lexical error, preventing the proof from being processed.\n\nTo improve the situation, we should use ASCII equivalents for these symbols. Specifically:\n- Replace \"⟷\" with \"<->\" (for bi-implication)\n- Replace \"→\" with \"-->\" (for implication)\n- Replace \"⟹\" with \"==>\" (for meta-implication)\n\nThe theorem statement should be rewritten as:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma iff_imply: \"(P <-> Q) ==> (P --> Q)\"\n```\n\nAnd the proof steps should be adjusted accordingly, using these ASCII representations consistently throughout.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the proof structure itself seems correct. Once the symbol issue is resolved, the proof should proceed smoothly. The reasoning steps are logical and follow the correct approach for proving this theorem.\n\nFor future actions, the acting agent should be careful to use Isabelle-compatible syntax, preferring ASCII representations over Unicode symbols unless certain that Unicode is supported in the specific Isabelle environment being used.",
