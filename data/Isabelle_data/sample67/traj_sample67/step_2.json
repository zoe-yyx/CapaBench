    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem \"iff_imply\"\n   - The theorem states: \"(P ⟷ Q) ⟹ (P → Q)\"\n   - We need to show that if P and Q are equivalent (iff), then P implies Q\n\n2. Identify the logical structure:\n   - The theorem has an implication (⟹) as the main connective\n   - The left side of the implication is a bi-implication (⟷)\n   - The right side is a simple implication (→)\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   - Use the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\" as our starting point\n   - Break down the bi-implication into its constituent parts\n   - Use these parts to prove the implication \"P → Q\"\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the assumption \"(P ⟷ Q)\"\n   b. Use the definition of bi-implication to split it into two parts:\n      - (P → Q) and (Q → P)\n   c. Focus on the (P → Q) part, as this is exactly what we need to prove\n   d. Conclude that (P → Q) holds directly from the assumption\n\n5. Consider potential proof techniques:\n   - Direct proof using the assumption\n   - Possibly use the \"unfold\" tactic to expand the definition of ⟷\n   - Use the \"assumption\" tactic to complete the proof\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the bi-implication operator\n   - Be ready to justify each step if needed\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward\n   - The key insight is recognizing that (P ⟷ Q) already contains (P → Q)\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Correct ASCII representation: The main issue was the incorrect ASCII representation of logical symbols. We need to use \"<->\" for bi-implication (↔), \"-->\" for implication (→), and \"==>\" for meta-implication (⟹).\n\n2. Maintain proof structure: The logical structure of the proof was correct, so we should keep the same steps and reasoning.\n\n3. Rewrite the lemma: Start by rewriting the lemma statement using the correct ASCII symbols:\n   lemma iff_imply: \"(P <-> Q) ==> (P --> Q)\"\n\n4. Proof steps: The proof steps should remain the same, but with corrected symbol usage:\n   a. Assume \"P <-> Q\"\n   b. Show that this assumption implies \"(P --> Q) & (Q --> P)\"\n   c. Extract \"P --> Q\" from the conjunction\n   d. Conclude the proof using the extracted implication\n\n5. Use of tactics: Continue using the 'simp' tactic for simplification and 'assumption' for concluding the proof, as these were correctly applied in the previous attempt.\n\n6. Verification: After rewriting the proof with correct symbols, ensure that each step is properly recognized by Isabelle and that there are no parsing errors.\n\n7. Documentation: Consider adding comments to explain key steps in the proof, especially the breakdown of the bi-implication, to enhance readability and understanding.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The ASCII representation of logical symbols is still incorrect, causing parsing errors in Isabelle.\nImprovement: Use the correct Isabelle-specific ASCII representations for logical operators: \"\\<longleftrightarrow>\" for bi-implication and \"\\<longrightarrow>\" for implication.\n```\n\nThe main issue persists in the incorrect representation of logical symbols. While we made progress by recognizing the need for ASCII representation, we used HTML-style arrows (<->, -->) instead of Isabelle's specific syntax.\n\nTo improve our next steps:\n\n1. Use the correct Isabelle syntax:\n   - Replace \"<->\" with \"\\<longleftrightarrow>\" for bi-implication\n   - Replace \"-->\" with \"\\<longrightarrow>\" for implication\n   - Keep \"==>\" as it is correct for meta-implication\n\n2. Rewrite the lemma statement:\n   lemma iff_imply: \"(P \\<longleftrightarrow> Q) \\<Longrightarrow> (P \\<longrightarrow> Q)\"\n\n3. Adjust the proof steps accordingly, using the correct symbols throughout.\n\n4. Double-check each line of the proof for correct syntax before submission.\n\n5. Consider using Isabelle's apply-style proof method instead of Isar style if it proves more straightforward for this particular lemma.\n\n6. If syntax issues persist, consult Isabelle documentation or examples for the correct representation of logical operators in different contexts (e.g., lemma statements vs. proof steps).\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we should be able to overcome the parsing errors and progress with the actual logical proof of the lemma.",
