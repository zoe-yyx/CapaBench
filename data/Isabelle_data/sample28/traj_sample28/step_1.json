    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for tree_example3_tree_reverse:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that reversing tree_example3a results in tree_example3b.\n   - This involves the tree_reverse function and the defined tree structures.\n\n2. Break down the structures:\n   - Analyze the structure of tree_example3a and tree_example3b.\n   - Recognize that tree_example2a and tree_example2b are used in these structures.\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Expand the definitions:\n      - Expand the definitions of tree_example3a and tree_example3b.\n      - This will reveal the full structure of both trees.\n\n   b. Apply tree_reverse:\n      - Apply the tree_reverse function to tree_example3a.\n      - Use the definition of tree_reverse for Node case.\n\n   c. Simplify step-by-step:\n      - Simplify the inner nodes first (tree_example2a).\n      - Then simplify the outer structure.\n\n   d. Compare results:\n      - Show that the result of tree_reverse tree_example3a matches the structure of tree_example3b.\n\n4. Potential lemmas:\n   - It might be helpful to prove a lemma about reversing tree_example2a resulting in tree_example2b.\n   - This lemma can be used in the main proof to simplify the process.\n\n5. Proof techniques:\n   - Use simp to expand definitions and simplify expressions.\n   - Apply the definition of tree_reverse explicitly where needed.\n   - Use case analysis if direct simplification is not sufficient.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the transformation is correct.\n   - Confirm that the final reversed structure exactly matches tree_example3b.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to systematically prove that reversing tree_example3a indeed results in tree_example3b, thus establishing the theorem tree_example3_tree_reverse.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo progress with the proof of the theorem tree_example3_tree_reverse, we need to address the lexical error first and then proceed with our proving strategy. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Fix the syntax error:\n   - Replace the Unicode arrow \"â‡’\" with the ASCII arrow \"=>\" in the tree_reverse function definition.\n   - This should resolve the lexical error and allow Isabelle to parse the theory file correctly.\n\n2. Once the syntax is corrected, we can proceed with our proving strategy:\n   - Expand the definitions of tree_example3a and tree_example3b, which has already been done in the proof.\n   - The next step is to apply the tree_reverse function to tree_example3a.\n\n3. Apply tree_reverse to tree_example3a:\n   - Use the definition of tree_reverse to transform tree_example3a.\n   - Start with the outermost Node and work inwards.\n   - The transformation should look like this:\n     tree_reverse (Node (Node Leaf 3 Leaf) 5 (Node (Node Leaf 8 Leaf) 100 (Node Leaf 9 Leaf)))\n     = Node (tree_reverse (Node (Node Leaf 8 Leaf) 100 (Node Leaf 9 Leaf))) 5 (tree_reverse (Node Leaf 3 Leaf))\n\n4. Continue simplifying:\n   - Apply tree_reverse to the inner nodes.\n   - Simplify step by step until the entire structure is reversed.\n\n5. Compare the result:\n   - After full simplification, compare the resulting structure with the expanded definition of tree_example3b.\n   - They should match exactly.\n\n6. Use appropriate Isabelle tactics:\n   - Use 'simp' to expand definitions and simplify expressions.\n   - Apply the definition of tree_reverse explicitly where needed using 'apply (rule tree_reverse.simps)'.\n   - If direct simplification is not sufficient, consider using case analysis with 'apply (cases ...)'.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to prove that tree_reverse tree_example3a equals tree_example3b, thus establishing the theorem tree_example3_tree_reverse.\n",
