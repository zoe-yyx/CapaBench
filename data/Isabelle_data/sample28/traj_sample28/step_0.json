    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for tree_example3_tree_reverse:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that reversing tree_example3a results in tree_example3b.\n   - This involves the tree_reverse function and the defined tree structures.\n\n2. Break down the structures:\n   - Analyze the structure of tree_example3a and tree_example3b.\n   - Recognize that tree_example2a and tree_example2b are used in these structures.\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Expand the definitions:\n      - Expand the definitions of tree_example3a and tree_example3b.\n      - This will reveal the full structure of both trees.\n\n   b. Apply tree_reverse:\n      - Apply the tree_reverse function to tree_example3a.\n      - Use the definition of tree_reverse for Node case.\n\n   c. Simplify step-by-step:\n      - Simplify the inner nodes first (tree_example2a).\n      - Then simplify the outer structure.\n\n   d. Compare results:\n      - Show that the result of tree_reverse tree_example3a matches the structure of tree_example3b.\n\n4. Potential lemmas:\n   - It might be helpful to prove a lemma about reversing tree_example2a resulting in tree_example2b.\n   - This lemma can be used in the main proof to simplify the process.\n\n5. Proof techniques:\n   - Use simp to expand definitions and simplify expressions.\n   - Apply the definition of tree_reverse explicitly where needed.\n   - Use case analysis if direct simplification is not sufficient.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the transformation is correct.\n   - Confirm that the final reversed structure exactly matches tree_example3b.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to systematically prove that reversing tree_example3a indeed results in tree_example3b, thus establishing the theorem tree_example3_tree_reverse.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem tree_example3_tree_reverse, we should follow the strategic plan outlined. Since we're at the starting point of the proof, our first step should be to expand the definitions of tree_example3a and tree_example3b. This will give us a clear view of the full structure of both trees and set the foundation for applying the tree_reverse function.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. Start by expanding the definitions of tree_example3a and tree_example3b.\n2. This expansion should include unfolding the definitions of tree_example2a and tree_example2b as well, as they are components of the larger trees.\n3. Use the simp command with the appropriate definition names to perform this expansion.\n\nBy expanding these definitions, we'll be able to see the complete structure of both trees. This will make it easier to apply the tree_reverse function in subsequent steps and to compare the results of the transformation.\n\nAfter this expansion, we'll be in a better position to apply the tree_reverse function to tree_example3a and begin the step-by-step simplification process as outlined in the plan.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof encountered a lexical error due to an invalid character in the type definition of the tree_reverse function.\n\nImprovement: Replace the invalid character \"⇒\" with the correct ASCII equivalent \"=>\" in the type definition of tree_reverse function to resolve the lexical error and proceed with the proof.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights the key issue preventing progress in the proof and provides a specific, actionable step to resolve it. The error message clearly indicates a problem with the \"⇒\" symbol in the type definition of the tree_reverse function. This symbol is likely a Unicode arrow, which Isabelle might not recognize in this context.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should modify the tree_reverse function definition to use the ASCII arrow \"=>\" instead of \"⇒\".\n2. After making this change, the proof should be able to proceed without lexical errors.\n3. Once the syntax error is resolved, the reasoning and acting agents can continue with the planned steps of expanding definitions and applying the tree_reverse function.\n4. The planning agent may need to adjust the strategy slightly to account for any time lost in fixing this error, but the overall approach of expanding definitions and then applying tree_reverse step-by-step remains valid.\n\nThis change should allow the proof to continue, focusing on the logical steps rather than being hindered by syntax issues. The reflecting agent should continue to monitor for any similar syntax or formatting issues in future steps to ensure smooth progress of the proof.",
