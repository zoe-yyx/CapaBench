    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove a universal statement about the relationship between P and Q\n\n2. Understand the given assumption:\n   - Assumption H: \"∀a. P a ⟶ Q a\"\n   - This means for all 'a', if P holds for 'a', then Q holds for 'a'\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - We need to prove: \"∀a. ¬Q a ⟶ ¬P a\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the assumption\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"proof\" to begin the proof\n   b. Use \"fix\" to introduce an arbitrary element\n   c. Use \"show\" to state the goal for this arbitrary element\n\n5. Proof strategy:\n   a. Assume \"¬Q a\" for the arbitrary 'a'\n   b. Use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume \"P a\"\n      - Derive a contradiction using the assumption H and the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n   c. Conclude \"¬P a\" from the contradiction\n\n6. Key proof steps:\n   a. Apply the assumption H to the fixed 'a'\n   b. Use modus ponens with the assumed \"P a\" to derive \"Q a\"\n   c. Show that this contradicts the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use \"qed\" to finish the proof\n\n8. Review and optimize:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if any simplification or automated tools can be used to make the proof more concise\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the critical system-level errors we're encountering, it's clear that the issue lies not with the proof itself, but with the Isabelle environment. The database file that Isabelle relies on has been moved and is now read-only, preventing any operations from being performed.\n\nBefore we can proceed with the proof, we need to resolve these environmental issues. Here's what we should focus on:\n\n1. Database Location: The error message indicates that the database file has been moved. We need to locate where it has been moved to.\n\n2. File Permissions: Once located, we need to ensure that the database file has the correct read and write permissions. The current read-only status is preventing Isabelle from functioning properly.\n\n3. Isabelle Configuration: After locating the file and fixing permissions, we may need to update Isabelle's configuration to point to the correct file location.\n\n4. Environment Reset: It might be necessary to restart Isabelle or clear its cache to ensure it recognizes the updated configuration.\n\nOnly after these system-level issues are resolved should we attempt to run the proof again. The proof itself appears to be correctly structured, so once the environment is fixed, it should execute without issues.\n\nFor the next step, I recommend focusing entirely on resolving these database and file system issues. This may require assistance from a system administrator or someone with the necessary permissions to modify the Isabelle installation and its associated files.\n",
