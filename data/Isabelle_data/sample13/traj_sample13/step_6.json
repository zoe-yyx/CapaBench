    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove a universal statement about the relationship between P and Q\n\n2. Understand the given assumption:\n   - Assumption H: \"∀a. P a ⟶ Q a\"\n   - This means for all 'a', if P holds for 'a', then Q holds for 'a'\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - We need to prove: \"∀a. ¬Q a ⟶ ¬P a\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the assumption\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"proof\" to begin the proof\n   b. Use \"fix\" to introduce an arbitrary element\n   c. Use \"show\" to state the goal for this arbitrary element\n\n5. Proof strategy:\n   a. Assume \"¬Q a\" for the arbitrary 'a'\n   b. Use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume \"P a\"\n      - Derive a contradiction using the assumption H and the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n   c. Conclude \"¬P a\" from the contradiction\n\n6. Key proof steps:\n   a. Apply the assumption H to the fixed 'a'\n   b. Use modus ponens with the assumed \"P a\" to derive \"Q a\"\n   c. Show that this contradicts the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use \"qed\" to finish the proof\n\n8. Review and optimize:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if any simplification or automated tools can be used to make the proof more concise\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, our reasoning should focus on addressing the system-level issues rather than the proof itself. The error messages indicate problems with the Isabelle environment, specifically related to a read-only database file that has been moved. Here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next steps:\n\n1. Database File Investigation:\n   The primary issue appears to be with the Isabelle database file. The acting agent should:\n   a. Locate the Isabelle database file.\n   b. Check its current location and ensure it matches the expected path in Isabelle's configuration.\n   c. Verify the file permissions, ensuring they allow both read and write access.\n\n2. Isabelle Configuration Check:\n   There might be a mismatch between Isabelle's configuration and the actual file location. The agent should:\n   a. Review Isabelle's configuration settings.\n   b. Ensure the database file path in the configuration is correct and up-to-date.\n   c. If the file has been moved, update the configuration to reflect the new location.\n\n3. User Permissions Verification:\n   The error suggests a permissions issue. The agent should:\n   a. Verify that the user running Isabelle has the necessary permissions to access and modify the database file.\n   b. If running in a restricted environment, consider temporarily elevating permissions for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n4. Isabelle Restart and Cache Clear:\n   Sometimes, clearing caches and restarting can resolve such issues. The agent should:\n   a. Close all instances of Isabelle.\n   b. Clear any temporary files or caches related to Isabelle.\n   c. Restart Isabelle and attempt to load the theory file again.\n\n5. Isabelle Reinstallation (if necessary):\n   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, a clean reinstallation might be necessary. The agent should:\n   a. Back up any important files or custom configurations.\n   b. Uninstall the current Isabelle installation.\n   c. Download and install the latest stable version of Isabelle.\n   d. Reconfigure Isabelle with the correct settings.\n\nBy addressing these system-level issues, we can create a stable environment for running the proof. Once these technical hurdles are overcome, we can return to executing and potentially refining the Isabelle proof itself. The acting agent should focus on these environmental checks and fixes in the next round of actions before attempting to run the proof again.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The Isabelle system is encountering critical database access issues, preventing the execution of the proof.\n\nImprovement: Focus on resolving the system-level database problems by locating and fixing the moved database file, updating Isabelle's configuration, and ensuring proper file permissions before attempting to run the proof again.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current roadblock is not in the proof itself, but in the Isabelle environment. The flaw identifies the core issue: the database file has been moved and is now read-only, causing Isabelle to fail.\n\nThe improvement suggests a clear path forward. Instead of trying to modify the proof, the next steps should be entirely focused on fixing the Isabelle environment. This includes:\n\n1. Locating the moved database file\n2. Ensuring it has the correct read and write permissions\n3. Updating Isabelle's configuration to point to the correct file location\n4. Possibly restarting Isabelle or clearing its cache\n\nOnly after these system-level issues are resolved should we return to working on the proof itself. This approach will ensure a stable environment for theorem proving and avoid wasting effort on attempting to run proofs in a non-functional system.",
