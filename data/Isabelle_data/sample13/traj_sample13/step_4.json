Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove a universal statement about the relationship between P and Q\n\n2. Understand the given assumption:\n   - Assumption H: \"∀a. P a ⟶ Q a\"\n   - This means for all 'a', if P holds for 'a', then Q holds for 'a'\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - We need to prove: \"∀a. ¬Q a ⟶ ¬P a\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the assumption\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"proof\" to begin the proof\n   b. Use \"fix\" to introduce an arbitrary element\n   c. Use \"show\" to state the goal for this arbitrary element\n\n5. Proof strategy:\n   a. Assume \"¬Q a\" for the arbitrary 'a'\n   b. Use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume \"P a\"\n      - Derive a contradiction using the assumption H and the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n   c. Conclude \"¬P a\" from the contradiction\n\n6. Key proof steps:\n   a. Apply the assumption H to the fixed 'a'\n   b. Use modus ponens with the assumed \"P a\" to derive \"Q a\"\n   c. Show that this contradicts the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use \"qed\" to finish the proof\n\n8. Review and optimize:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if any simplification or automated tools can be used to make the proof more concise\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe main issue we're facing is a syntax error in the type definition. To resolve this, we need to modify our lemma statement to use ASCII symbols instead of Unicode characters. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. Replace the Unicode arrow \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\" in the type definition for P and Q.\n\n2. Similarly, replace other Unicode symbols in the lemma statement with their ASCII equivalents:\n   - Replace \"∀\" with \"!\"\n   - Replace \"⟶\" with \"-->\"\n\n3. Keep the rest of the proof structure intact, as it seems logically sound.\n\n4. After making these changes, we should be able to parse the lemma statement correctly and proceed with the proof.\n\n5. Once the syntax is corrected, we can focus on verifying the logical steps of the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should implement these changes in the lemma statement and then attempt to run the proof again. If successful, we can then move on to reviewing and optimizing the proof steps if necessary.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The error messages indicate a database-related issue rather than a problem with the Isabelle proof itself, suggesting an environment or system-level problem.\n\nImprovement: We need to focus on resolving the underlying system issue, possibly related to file permissions or database configuration, before attempting to run the proof again.\n```\n\nThe reflection on the current situation reveals that the problem we're facing is not related to the Isabelle proof itself, but rather to the environment in which we're trying to run it. The error messages consistently point to a database issue, specifically that the database file has been moved since it was opened and is now read-only.\n\nThis situation calls for a different approach than what we've been focusing on so far. Instead of refining the proof or adjusting the Isabelle syntax, we need to address the system-level problem. Here are some points to consider for the next steps:\n\n1. Environment Check: We should verify the integrity of the Isabelle environment, ensuring all necessary components are correctly installed and configured.\n\n2. File Permissions: Check the permissions of the database file and the directory it's in. Ensure the user running the Isabelle process has the necessary read and write permissions.\n\n3. Database Configuration: Review the Isabelle database configuration to ensure it's pointing to the correct location and has the proper access rights.\n\n4. System Resources: Verify that there are sufficient system resources (disk space, memory) available for Isabelle to operate correctly.\n\n5. Reinstallation or Update: If the issue persists, consider reinstalling or updating Isabelle to ensure all components are in their expected state.\n\n6. Alternative Proof Method: As a workaround, we might consider using a different proof assistant or method that doesn't rely on the same database system, if possible.\n\nFor the next round, the planning and acting agents should prioritize resolving these system-level issues before attempting to run the proof again. Once the environment is stable, we can return to refining and executing the Isabelle proof.",
