Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove a universal statement about the relationship between P and Q\n\n2. Understand the given assumption:\n   - Assumption H: \"∀a. P a ⟶ Q a\"\n   - This means for all 'a', if P holds for 'a', then Q holds for 'a'\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - We need to prove: \"∀a. ¬Q a ⟶ ¬P a\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the assumption\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"proof\" to begin the proof\n   b. Use \"fix\" to introduce an arbitrary element\n   c. Use \"show\" to state the goal for this arbitrary element\n\n5. Proof strategy:\n   a. Assume \"¬Q a\" for the arbitrary 'a'\n   b. Use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume \"P a\"\n      - Derive a contradiction using the assumption H and the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n   c. Conclude \"¬P a\" from the contradiction\n\n6. Key proof steps:\n   a. Apply the assumption H to the fixed 'a'\n   b. Use modus ponens with the assumed \"P a\" to derive \"Q a\"\n   c. Show that this contradicts the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use \"qed\" to finish the proof\n\n8. Review and optimize:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check if any simplification or automated tools can be used to make the proof more concise\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation, it appears there's a lexical error in the theorem statement. The error message indicates an issue with parsing the type \"⇒ bool\" on line 6. This suggests that the Isabelle system is not recognizing the arrow symbol used for the function type.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we should adjust the type annotation in the theorem statement. Instead of using \"⇒\" for the function arrow, we should use \"=>\", which is the ASCII representation of the function arrow in Isabelle.\n\nThe reasoning for the next step should be:\n\n1. Modify the type annotation in the theorem statement to use the correct ASCII representation of the function arrow.\n2. Replace \"'a ⇒ bool\" with \"'a => bool\" in the fixes clause of the lemma.\n3. Keep the rest of the proof structure intact, as it looks correct and follows our planned strategy.\n\nAfter making this change, we should be able to proceed with the proof as originally planned. The acting agent should focus on implementing this modification to resolve the parsing error before continuing with the proof steps.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The lexical error persists due to the use of Unicode symbols for logical operators in the theorem statement.\n\nImprovement: Replace all Unicode logical symbols with their ASCII equivalents in the theorem statement and proof to ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser.\n```\n\nThe current result is still unsatisfactory because we have not fully addressed the lexical issues in the theorem statement and proof. While we correctly replaced the function arrow (⇒) with its ASCII equivalent (=>), we overlooked the other Unicode symbols used for logical operators.\n\nTo improve our approach, we need to systematically replace all Unicode logical symbols with their ASCII equivalents. This includes:\n\n1. Replace \"∀\" with \"ALL\" for universal quantification\n2. Replace \"⟶\" with \"-->\" for implication\n3. Replace \"¬\" with \"~\" for negation\n\nAdditionally, we should review the entire proof structure and ensure all logical symbols are using ASCII representations. This will help prevent any further parsing errors and allow Isabelle to process the theorem and proof correctly.\n\nFor the next steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Modify the assumes clause to use \"ALL\" instead of \"∀\"\n2. Change the implication symbol in both the assumes and shows clauses to \"-->\"\n3. Update the negation symbol in the shows clause to \"~\"\n4. Review and update any remaining logical symbols in the proof body\n\nBy making these changes, we should be able to resolve the lexical errors and proceed with the proof as intended. This approach aligns with our overall goal of successfully proving the problem by ensuring that Isabelle can properly parse and process our input.",
