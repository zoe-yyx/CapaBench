Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove a universal statement about the relationship between P and Q\n\n2.

Identify the goal:\n   - We need to prove: \"∀a. ¬Q a ⟶ ¬P a\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the assumption\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"proof\" to begin the proof\n   b. Use \"fix\" to introduce an arbitrary element\n   c. Use \"show\" to state the goal for this arbitrary element\n\n5. Proof strategy:\n   a. Assume \"¬Q a\" for the arbitrary 'a'\n   b. Use proof by contradiction:\n      - Assume \"P a\"\n      - Derive a contradiction using the assumption H and the assumed \"¬Q a\"\n   c.

    "reasoning": "\n1. The overall structure of the proof is correct, but we need to be more explicit in our reasoning and use of assumptions.\n\n2. We should start by fixing an arbitrary 'a' and then show the implication \"~Q a --> ~P a\" for this 'a'.\n\n3. When assuming \"~Q a\", we should label this assumption for later use.\n\n4. We need to explicitly instantiate the universal quantifier in assumption H for our specific 'a' before using it.\n\n5. When assuming \"P a\" for the contradiction proof, we should label this assumption as well.\n\n6. We should use the 'from' keyword to clearly indicate which facts we're using in each step.\n\n7. Instead of using the 'mp' rule directly, we can use the 'modus_ponens' method which is more intuitive in Isabelle.\n\n8. We should use the 'contradiction' method to derive False from contradictory facts.\n\n9. Each step should be justified either by referencing previous facts or by applying specific rules.\n\n10. We should avoid using backticks for assumptions and instead use proper Isabelle syntax for labeling and referencing facts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, we can construct a clear and step-by-step proof that Isabelle can verify without issues.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof failed due to a lexical error in the type definition, specifically with the arrow symbol used for the function type.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\" in the type definition to ensure compatibility and correct parsing by Isabelle.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is a syntax error in the type definition. Isabelle is having trouble parsing the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" used to define the function type. This is likely because the system is expecting ASCII characters.\n\nTo improve our approach:\n\n1. We should use ASCII symbols instead of Unicode when defining types and logical operators. For example, use \"=>\" instead of \"⇒\", \"->\" instead of \"⟶\", and \"!\" instead of \"∀\".\n\n2. We should be more careful about copying and pasting from other sources, as they might introduce incompatible Unicode characters.\n\n3. It would be helpful to review Isabelle's syntax guidelines to ensure we're using the correct symbols throughout our proof.\n\n4. We should test our code in small increments, starting with the basic theory and lemma definitions, to catch and fix syntax errors early.\n\n5. When encountering errors, we should focus first on resolving syntax and parsing issues before moving on to the logical structure of the proof.\n\nBy addressing these points, we can ensure that Isabelle can properly parse our theorem and proof, allowing us to then focus on the logical correctness of our argument.",
