Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q of type \"'a ⇒ bool\"\n   - We need to prove a universal statement about the relationship between P and Q\n\n2.

Identify the goal:\n   - We need to prove: \"∀a. ¬Q a ⟶ ¬P a\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the assumption\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"proof\" to begin the proof\n   b. Use \"fix\" to introduce an arbitrary element\n   c. Use \"show\" to state the goal for this arbitrary element\n\n5. Proof strategy:\n   a.

    "reasoning": "\nTo resolve the lexical errors and enable Isabelle to properly parse the theorem and proof, we need to systematically replace all Unicode logical symbols with their ASCII equivalents. This will ensure compatibility with Isabelle's parser. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Modify the theorem statement:\n   - Replace \"∀\" with \"ALL\" for universal quantification\n   - Change \"⟶\" to \"-->\" for implication\n   - Update \"¬\" to \"~\" for negation\n\n2. The modified theorem statement should look like this:\n   lemma logic_ex3:\n     fixes P Q :: \"'a => bool\"\n     assumes H: \"ALL a. P a --> Q a\"\n     shows \"ALL a. ~Q a --> ~P a\"\n\n3. Review the proof structure:\n   - Ensure all logical symbols in the proof body are using ASCII representations\n   - Replace any remaining Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents\n\n4. Key points to remember in the proof:\n   - Use \"ALL\" for universal quantification\n   - Use \"-->\" for implication\n   - Use \"~\" for negation\n   - Keep other Isabelle-specific keywords like \"proof\", \"fix\", \"assume\", \"show\", \"have\", and \"qed\" unchanged\n\n5. After making these changes, the lexical errors should be resolved, allowing Isabelle to parse the theorem and proof correctly.\n\n6. Once the parsing issues are fixed, we can focus on the logical structure of the proof, ensuring it follows the planned strategy and correctly demonstrates the theorem.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and proceed with the proof as intended.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof fails at the step where we try to derive \"Q a\" from \"P a\" and \"P a --> Q a\" using the rule \"mp\" (modus ponens).\n\nImprovement: We need to explicitly state and use the assumption \"ALL a. P a --> Q a\" before applying modus ponens, and ensure all steps are properly justified with clear reasoning.\n```\n\nReflecting on the current outcome, it's clear that the proof structure is mostly correct, but there are some issues with how we're using our assumptions and applying inference rules. Here are some key points to consider for improvement:\n\n1. We correctly fixed the lexical issues by replacing Unicode symbols with their ASCII equivalents, which allowed Isabelle to parse the theorem and most of the proof.\n\n2. The overall structure of the proof is logical, starting with fixing an arbitrary 'a', then proving the implication using the rule of implication introduction (impI).\n\n3. The issue arises when we try to use the assumption H. We need to be more explicit about how we're using this universal quantification.\n\n4. We should avoid using backticks for assumptions, as this is not standard Isabelle syntax. Instead, we should label our assumptions and refer to them by these labels.\n\n5. Each step in the proof should be clearly justified, either by referencing previous steps or by applying specific rules.\n\nFor the next attempt, we should:\n\n1. Explicitly instantiate the universal quantifier in assumption H for our specific 'a'.\n2. Label each assumption we make so we can refer to it later.\n3. Use the 'from' keyword to clearly show which previous facts we're using in each step.\n4. Apply rules more explicitly, using the 'rule' method where appropriate.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to complete the proof successfully without any gaps in the reasoning that Isabelle can't follow.",
