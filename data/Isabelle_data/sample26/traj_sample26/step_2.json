    "reasoning": "\nThe main issue we're facing is the presence of Unicode symbols in our proof, which is causing lexical errors. Our primary focus should be on converting all Unicode symbols to their ASCII equivalents. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. Symbol Conversion:\n   - Replace \"∀\" with \"\\<forall>\"\n   - Replace \"¬\" with \"\\<not>\"\n   - Replace \"⟶\" with \"\\<longrightarrow>\"\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   The overall structure of the proof seems correct, so we should maintain it while making the necessary symbol conversions.\n\n3. Systematic Approach:\n   Start from the lemma statement and work through each line of the proof, carefully replacing all Unicode symbols.\n\n4. Special Attention:\n   Pay extra attention to the assumption H, as this was specifically mentioned in the error message.\n\n5. Verification:\n   After making all replacements, review the entire proof once more to ensure no Unicode symbols were missed.\n\n6. Maintain Logical Flow:\n   While replacing symbols, ensure that the logical flow and meaning of each step remain intact.\n\nBy following this reasoning, we should be able to resolve the lexical errors while preserving the logical structure of our proof. This will allow us to move forward with the actual proving process once these syntactical issues are resolved.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof still contains Unicode symbols (¬ and ⟶) in the error message, indicating that some symbols were not properly converted to their ASCII equivalents in the Isabelle code.\n\nImprovement: Carefully review and convert all remaining Unicode symbols in the proof, especially focusing on the lines mentioned in the error message (line 18), ensuring all symbols are properly represented in ASCII format.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that despite our previous efforts to convert Unicode symbols, some still remain in the proof, causing issues. The improvement suggests a more thorough review and conversion process, with special attention to the problematic areas identified in the error message.\n\nTo act on this reflection, the next steps should involve:\n\n1. Double-checking every line of the proof, especially around line 18, for any remaining Unicode symbols.\n2. Ensuring that all instances of \"¬\" are replaced with \"\\<not>\" and \"⟶\" with \"\\<longrightarrow>\".\n3. Verifying that the ASCII representations are correctly formatted and spaced within the proof.\n4. After making these changes, re-running the proof to see if the error is resolved.\n5. If issues persist, consider reviewing the overall structure of the proof to ensure it follows Isabelle's syntax and proof style guidelines.\n\nBy meticulously addressing these symbol conversion issues, we should be able to overcome the current obstacle and progress with the actual logical proving process.",
