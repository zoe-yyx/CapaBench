    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of logic_ex4, we should follow the planned structure:\n\n1. We need to prove a universally quantified implication, so we should start by introducing a universal quantifier and then an implication.\n\n2. The planned strategy suggests using proof by contradiction. This means we should assume the negation of our goal and work towards deriving a contradiction.\n\n3. We have an assumption H that we can use to derive the contradiction. The key is to apply this assumption correctly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the next steps in the proof should be:\n\n1. Use the 'rule' tactic with 'allI' to introduce the universal quantifier. This will allow us to work with an arbitrary 'a'.\n\n2. Then, use the 'rule' tactic with 'impI' to introduce the implication. This will give us the assumption P a and the goal Q a.\n\n3. After that, we should set up the contradiction by assuming ¬Q a. This can be done using the 'rule' tactic with 'ccontr'.\n\nThese steps will set up the basic structure of our proof by contradiction and allow us to start working towards deriving the contradiction using the assumption H.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but there's a lexical error in the type declaration, likely due to the use of a non-standard arrow symbol.\nImprovement: Replace the non-standard arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the standard Isabelle function type arrow \"=>\" in the type declaration for P and Q.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure and approach are fundamentally sound. The steps to introduce the universal quantifier, implication, and set up the contradiction are all correct and align well with the planned strategy. However, the execution has been halted due to a lexical error in the type declaration.\n\nThe error message points to the use of \"⇒\" in the type declaration. In Isabelle, the standard symbol for function types is \"=>\", not \"⇒\". This small difference is causing the parser to fail.\n\nFor the next action step, the acting agent should modify the type declaration line to use the correct arrow symbol:\n\n```isabelle\nfixes P Q :: \"'a => bool\"\n```\n\nThis change should resolve the lexical error and allow the proof to proceed. The rest of the proof structure can remain the same, as it correctly implements the planned strategy of proof by contradiction.\n\nOnce this correction is made, the proof should be able to continue from the point where we assumed \"¬Q a\". The next steps would involve using the assumption H to derive the contradiction and complete the proof.",
