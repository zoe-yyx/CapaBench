    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem mul_1_r: \"mymul n (MySuc MyZero) = n\"\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are working with a custom natural number type 'mynat'\n   - We have custom addition (myadd) and multiplication (mymul) functions defined\n   - We need to prove that multiplying any number n by 1 (represented as MySuc MyZero) on the right side equals n\n\n2. Analyze the given theorems:\n   - mymul_comm: \"mymul n m = mymul m n\" (commutativity of multiplication)\n   - mymul_1_l: \"mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = n\" (left identity of multiplication)\n\n3. Develop the proof strategy:\n   a. Use structural induction on n\n   b. Prove the base case for n = MyZero\n   c. Prove the inductive case for n = MySuc n'\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Base case (n = MyZero):\n      - Expand the definition of mymul\n      - Simplify the expression\n   \n   b. Inductive case (n = MySuc n'):\n      - Assume the inductive hypothesis: mymul n' (MySuc MyZero) = n'\n      - Expand the definition of mymul for MySuc n'\n      - Use the definition of myadd\n      - Apply the inductive hypothesis\n      - Simplify the expression\n\n5. Use available theorems:\n   - Consider using mymul_comm to relate mul_1_r to mymul_1_l\n   - Alternatively, prove the theorem directly using the definitions and induction\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Combine the base case and inductive case\n   - Conclude that the theorem holds for all n of type mynat\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem mul_1_r, utilizing the given definitions and theorems while following the principle of structural induction.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next steps:\n\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   - Replace all occurrences of \"â‡’\" with \"=>\" in the function type signatures for myadd and mymul.\n\n2. Base Case (MyZero):\n   - Apply the definition of mymul for MyZero.\n   - The left-hand side will simplify to MyZero.\n   - Show that this equals the right-hand side (which is also MyZero).\n\n3. Inductive Case (MySuc n'):\n   - Apply the definition of mymul for MySuc n'.\n   - This will result in: myadd (MySuc MyZero) (mymul n' (MySuc MyZero))\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis: mymul n' (MySuc MyZero) = n'\n   - After substitution, we need to show: myadd (MySuc MyZero) n' = MySuc n'\n   - Apply the definition of myadd for MySuc MyZero.\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - For each case, start with \"show ?case\" and then use the \"by\" keyword followed by appropriate proof methods.\n   - Suggested methods include \"simp\" for simplification and \"auto\" for automated reasoning.\n\n5. Theorem Usage:\n   - The mymul_1_l theorem might be useful in the inductive step, but it's marked as \"sorry\". If it's proven elsewhere, consider using it.\n\n6. Final Steps:\n   - After completing both cases, the overall theorem should be proven by the induction principle.\n\nThis reasoning provides a step-by-step guide for the acting agent to complete the proof of mul_1_r, addressing both the syntax issue and the logical steps required for the induction proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current state of the proof and the outcome, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete, with the inductive case (MySuc n') still using 'sorry', indicating a lack of a rigorous proof for this crucial step.\n\nImprovement: Complete the inductive step by explicitly showing that mymul (MySuc n') (MySuc MyZero) = MySuc n', using the induction hypothesis and the definitions of mymul and myadd.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The base case (MyZero) has been successfully proven using simplification with the mymul function definition.\n\n2. However, the inductive case (MySuc n') is still marked with 'sorry', which means this critical part of the proof is missing.\n\n3. To improve, we need to focus on completing the inductive step. This involves:\n   - Expanding the definition of mymul for MySuc n'\n   - Utilizing the induction hypothesis that mymul n' (MySuc MyZero) = n'\n   - Applying the definition of myadd\n   - Showing that the result equals MySuc n'\n\n4. The overall structure of the proof using induction is correct, but it needs to be fully fleshed out to be rigorous.\n\n5. There's no need to use the mymul_comm or mymul_1_l theorems (which are also marked as 'sorry'), as the proof can be completed using just the definitions of mymul and myadd.\n\nFor the next action step, the acting agent should focus on replacing the 'sorry' in the inductive case with a proper proof. This will likely involve using simplification (simp) with the relevant function definitions, and possibly some additional reasoning steps to connect the expanded terms to the desired equality.",
