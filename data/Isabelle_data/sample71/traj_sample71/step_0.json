    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem mul_1_r: \"mymul n (MySuc MyZero) = n\"\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are working with a custom natural number type 'mynat'\n   - We have custom addition (myadd) and multiplication (mymul) functions defined\n   - We need to prove that multiplying any number n by 1 (represented as MySuc MyZero) on the right side equals n\n\n2. Analyze the given theorems:\n   - mymul_comm: \"mymul n m = mymul m n\" (commutativity of multiplication)\n   - mymul_1_l: \"mymul (MySuc MyZero) n = n\" (left identity of multiplication)\n\n3. Develop the proof strategy:\n   a. Use structural induction on n\n   b. Prove the base case for n = MyZero\n   c. Prove the inductive case for n = MySuc n'\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Base case (n = MyZero):\n      - Expand the definition of mymul\n      - Simplify the expression\n   \n   b. Inductive case (n = MySuc n'):\n      - Assume the inductive hypothesis: mymul n' (MySuc MyZero) = n'\n      - Expand the definition of mymul for MySuc n'\n      - Use the definition of myadd\n      - Apply the inductive hypothesis\n      - Simplify the expression\n\n5. Use available theorems:\n   - Consider using mymul_comm to relate mul_1_r to mymul_1_l\n   - Alternatively, prove the theorem directly using the definitions and induction\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Combine the base case and inductive case\n   - Conclude that the theorem holds for all n of type mynat\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem mul_1_r, utilizing the given definitions and theorems while following the principle of structural induction.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mul_1_r: \"mymul n (MySuc MyZero) = n\", we should follow the structural induction approach outlined in the plan. Since we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start with setting up the induction framework.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We need to prove this theorem for all possible values of n, which are constructed using MyZero and MySuc.\n\n2. The most appropriate proof method for this type of problem is induction on the structure of n.\n\n3. By using induction, we'll be able to prove the theorem for the base case (MyZero) and then show that if it holds for some n', it also holds for MySuc n'.\n\n4. This approach aligns with the definition of mymul, which is also defined recursively on the structure of its first argument.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin the proof by applying induction on n. This will set up the framework for proving both the base case and the inductive step.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure was correctly set up, but the code failed to parse due to encoding issues with the arrow symbol (⇒).\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbol (⇒) with the ASCII equivalent (=>) in function type signatures to ensure proper parsing and proceed with the proof steps for both base and inductive cases.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that while the overall approach to the proof was correct, a technical issue prevented the code from being processed properly. The use of Unicode symbols, specifically the arrow (⇒), caused a parsing error in Isabelle.\n\nTo improve in the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should modify the code to use ASCII symbols instead of Unicode. Specifically, replace \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in the function type signatures for myadd and mymul.\n\n2. After fixing the syntax, proceed with completing the proof for both the base case (MyZero) and the inductive case (MySuc n').\n\n3. For the base case, the reasoning agent should focus on applying the definition of mymul for MyZero.\n\n4. For the inductive case, the reasoning agent should use the inductive hypothesis and the definition of mymul for MySuc.\n\n5. The acting agent should replace the 'sorry' placeholders with actual proof steps based on the reasoning provided.\n\nBy addressing the syntax issue and following through with the proof steps, we can make progress towards successfully proving the theorem mul_1_r without relying on 'sorry'.",
