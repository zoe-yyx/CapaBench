    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"reverse_size\" Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of a reversed tree is equal to the size of the original tree.\n   - This involves the functions tree_reverse and tree_size.\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the tree datatype and the functions, structural induction on the tree 't' is the most suitable approach.\n\n3. Set Up the Proof:\n   - Begin with \"induction t\" to start the structural induction.\n   - This will generate two cases: the base case (Leaf) and the inductive case (Node).\n\n4. Prove the Base Case:\n   - For the Leaf case, show that tree_size (tree_reverse Leaf) = tree_size Leaf.\n   - This should be straightforward using the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n\n5. Prove the Inductive Case:\n   - For the Node case, we need to prove the equality for Node l v r.\n   - Use the induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees.\n   - Apply the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n   - Perform algebraic manipulations to show the equality.\n\n6. Use Simplification:\n   - Throughout the proof, make extensive use of the 'simp' method to simplify expressions based on the function definitions.\n\n7. Handle Arithmetic:\n   - Be prepared to use arithmetic reasoning, as tree_size involves addition.\n   - The 'arith' method might be helpful for simple arithmetic goals.\n\n8. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Once both cases are proved, the theorem should be established by induction.\n\n9. Potential Challenges:\n   - Pay attention to the order of subtrees in the reversed Node.\n   - Ensure that the size calculation correctly accounts for the swapped subtrees.\n\n10. Final Verification:\n    - After completing the proof, review it to ensure all cases are covered and the logic is sound.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation, our reasoning should focus on addressing the technical issue while maintaining the correct proof structure. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. Environment Check:\n   The error message indicates a problem with the Isabelle database file. Before proceeding with the proof, we need to ensure that the Isabelle environment is properly set up. This includes checking file permissions, database locations, and write access.\n\n2. Syntax Verification:\n   Although the proof structure looks correct, the error message also mentions a lexical error at line 7. We should double-check the syntax of our function definitions, particularly the use of the arrow symbol (⇒) in type declarations.\n\n3. Proof Structure Preservation:\n   Once the technical issues are resolved, we should maintain the current proof structure as it correctly follows the induction principle for trees. The base case (Leaf) and inductive case (Node) are properly set up.\n\n4. Simplification Strategy:\n   The extensive use of the 'simp' method in the proof is appropriate. It effectively handles the function definitions and basic equalities. We should continue to use this strategy once we can run the proof.\n\n5. Induction Hypothesis Application:\n   In the Node case, the correct application of the induction hypothesis (Node.IH) is crucial. This step establishes the equality for the subtrees, which is fundamental to proving the overall theorem.\n\n6. Arithmetic Reasoning:\n   The proof correctly handles the arithmetic involved in calculating tree sizes. The steps that add and rearrange the size calculations are logically sound.\n\n7. Final Equality:\n   The proof concludes by showing that the size calculations for the reversed and original trees are equal, which is the essence of the theorem.\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Resolve the database access issue in the Isabelle environment.\n2. Verify the syntax of function definitions, especially the arrow symbol (⇒).\n3. Re-run the proof once technical issues are resolved.\n4. If the proof is accepted, no further changes are needed.\n5. If any logical issues arise after resolving technical problems, we'll need to revisit specific steps in the proof.\n\nThis reasoning aims to address the immediate technical obstacle while preserving the logically sound proof structure we've developed.\n",
