    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"reverse_size\" Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of a reversed tree is equal to the size of the original tree.\n   - This involves the functions tree_reverse and tree_size.\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the tree datatype and the functions, structural induction on the tree 't' is the most suitable approach.\n\n3. Set Up the Proof:\n   - Begin with \"induction t\" to start the structural induction.\n   - This will generate two cases: the base case (Leaf) and the inductive case (Node).\n\n4. Prove the Base Case:\n   - For the Leaf case, show that tree_size (tree_reverse Leaf) = tree_size Leaf.\n   - This should be straightforward using the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n\n5. Prove the Inductive Case:\n   - For the Node case, we need to prove the equality for Node l v r.\n   - Use the induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees.\n   - Apply the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n   - Perform algebraic manipulations to show the equality.\n\n6. Use Simplification:\n   - Throughout the proof, make extensive use of the 'simp' method to simplify expressions based on the function definitions.\n\n7. Handle Arithmetic:\n   - Be prepared to use arithmetic reasoning, as tree_size involves addition.\n   - The 'arith' method might be helpful for simple arithmetic goals.\n\n8. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Once both cases are proved, the theorem should be established by induction.\n\n9. Potential Challenges:\n   - Pay attention to the order of subtrees in the reversed Node.\n   - Ensure that the size calculation correctly accounts for the swapped subtrees.\n\n10. Final Verification:\n    - After completing the proof, review it to ensure all cases are covered and the logic is sound.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem \"reverse_size\", our first step should be to set up the structural induction on the tree 't' as planned. This approach is ideal because:\n\n1. The theorem statement is universally quantified over all trees 't'.\n2. Both tree_reverse and tree_size functions are defined recursively on the structure of the tree.\n3. Induction will allow us to prove the property for all possible tree structures.\n\nThe induction will generate two cases:\n1. Base case: Leaf\n2. Inductive case: Node l v r\n\nStarting with induction will provide a structured framework for our proof, allowing us to tackle each case separately. This aligns with our planned approach and sets us up for a systematic proof process.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin the proof by applying induction on 't'. This will generate the necessary subgoals for both the base case and the inductive case, which we can then address one by one using the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size, along with simplification and arithmetic reasoning as needed.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to a lexical error in the theory file, specifically with the arrow symbol in function type declarations.\n\nImprovement: Replace the Unicode arrow symbol \"⇒\" with the ASCII equivalent \"=>\" in the function type declarations for tree_reverse and tree_size.\n```\n\nThe error message indicates a lexical issue with parsing the type declaration, specifically at the arrow symbol \"⇒\". This suggests that the Isabelle environment might not be correctly interpreting the Unicode arrow symbol.\n\nTo improve the next steps:\n\n1. The acting agent should modify the theory file by replacing all instances of \"⇒\" with \"=>\" in the function type declarations. This includes lines for both tree_reverse and tree_size functions.\n\n2. After making these changes, the proof attempt should be rerun to see if the lexical error is resolved.\n\n3. If the error persists, we may need to investigate other potential encoding or syntax issues in the theory file.\n\n4. Once the syntax errors are resolved, we can proceed with the actual proof steps as originally planned, starting with the induction on 't'.\n\n5. It's important to note that the current proof attempt uses 'sorry' in the Node case, which we need to avoid in the final proof. The acting agent should focus on completing this case rigorously once the syntax issues are resolved.\n\nBy addressing these syntax issues first, we can ensure that Isabelle can properly parse and process our theory file, allowing us to focus on the actual proof steps in subsequent iterations.",
