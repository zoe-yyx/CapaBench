    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for \"reverse_size\" Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of a reversed tree is equal to the size of the original tree.\n   - This involves the functions tree_reverse and tree_size.\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the tree datatype and the functions, structural induction on the tree 't' is the most suitable approach.\n\n3. Set Up the Proof:\n   - Begin with \"induction t\" to start the structural induction.\n   - This will generate two cases: the base case (Leaf) and the inductive case (Node).\n\n4. Prove the Base Case:\n   - For the Leaf case, show that tree_size (tree_reverse Leaf) = tree_size Leaf.\n   - This should be straightforward using the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n\n5. Prove the Inductive Case:\n   - For the Node case, we need to prove the equality for Node l v r.\n   - Use the induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees.\n   - Apply the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n   - Perform algebraic manipulations to show the equality.\n\n6. Use Simplification:\n   - Throughout the proof, make extensive use of the 'simp' method to simplify expressions based on the function definitions.\n\n7. Handle Arithmetic:\n   - Be prepared to use arithmetic reasoning, as tree_size involves addition.\n   - The 'arith' method might be helpful for simple arithmetic goals.\n\n8. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Once both cases are proved, the theorem should be established by induction.\n\n9. Potential Challenges:\n   - Pay attention to the order of subtrees in the reversed Node.\n   - Ensure that the size calculation correctly accounts for the swapped subtrees.\n\n10. Final Verification:\n    - After completing the proof, review it to ensure all cases are covered and the logic is sound.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Syntax Correction:\n   - Replace all occurrences of \"â‡’\" with \"=>\" in the function type declarations.\n   - This should be done for both tree_reverse and tree_size functions.\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   - The current proof structure using induction on 't' is correct and should be maintained.\n   - The Leaf case has been properly handled with 'by simp'.\n\n3. Node Case:\n   - Focus on completing the Node case, which is currently using 'sorry'.\n   - Use the induction hypothesis provided by the Node case.\n\n4. Proof Strategy for Node Case:\n   - Expand the definitions of tree_size and tree_reverse for the Node case.\n   - Apply the induction hypotheses to the reversed left and right subtrees.\n   - Perform algebraic manipulations to show that the sizes are equal.\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Make use of the 'simp' method to simplify expressions based on function definitions.\n   - Consider using 'simp add:' to include specific lemmas or function definitions if needed.\n\n6. Arithmetic:\n   - Be prepared to handle simple arithmetic reasoning, possibly using the 'arith' method.\n\n7. Step-by-Step Approach:\n   - Break down the Node case into smaller steps if necessary, using 'have' statements to establish intermediate results.\n\n8. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all cases are covered and the logic is sound.\n\nBy following these steps, the acting agent should be able to correct the syntax issues and proceed with a rigorous proof of the Node case, ultimately establishing the reverse_size theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt encountered a database constraint error, likely due to an issue with the Isabelle environment setup rather than the proof itself.\nImprovement: Verify and potentially reset the Isabelle environment, ensuring proper database configuration, before proceeding with the proof refinement.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that the current issue is not directly related to the proof strategy or logic, but rather to the underlying Isabelle system configuration. The SQLite error suggests a problem with the database used by Isabelle to store session information.\n\nTo move forward:\n\n1. Technical setup: The LLM agents should work with the user or system administrator to resolve the database constraint issue. This may involve:\n   - Checking the Isabelle installation for integrity\n   - Clearing any corrupt session data\n   - Ensuring proper permissions for the Isabelle working directory\n\n2. Proof continuation: Once the technical issue is resolved, the focus should return to the proof itself:\n   - The syntax corrections for \"=>\" have been properly applied\n   - The proof structure using induction is correct\n   - The Leaf case has been handled\n   - The Node case still needs to be completed rigorously\n\n3. Next steps for the proof:\n   - Expand the definitions of tree_size and tree_reverse in the Node case\n   - Apply the induction hypotheses to the reversed subtrees\n   - Use algebraic manipulation to show size equality\n   - Utilize 'simp' and possibly 'arith' methods to simplify and prove the case\n\n4. Verification: After resolving the technical issue and completing the proof, ensure all cases are covered and the logic is sound.\n\nBy addressing the database issue first and then returning to the proof strategy, the LLM agents can work towards successfully proving the reverse_size theorem.",
