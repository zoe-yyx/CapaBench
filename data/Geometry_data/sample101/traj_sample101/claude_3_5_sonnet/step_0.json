    "observation": "A circle is centered at $O$ and has a radius of 10 units. Point $P, Q$ is on the circle. If $\\angle POQ = 120^\\circ$, what is the length of the arc $PQ$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Circle centered at O with radius 10 units\n   - Points P and Q are on the circle\n   - Angle POQ is 120\u00b0\n\n2. Recall the formula for arc length:\n   Arc length = (central angle in radians) \u00d7 radius\n\n3. Convert the central angle from degrees to radians:\n   - 120\u00b0 needs to be converted to radians\n\n4. Apply the arc length formula:\n   - Use the converted angle and given radius\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Perform the necessary multiplication\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the circle's circumference\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we should start by focusing on the formula for arc length and the conversion of the central angle from degrees to radians. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We know that the arc length formula is: Arc length = (central angle in radians) \u00d7 radius\n\n2. We are given the central angle in degrees (120\u00b0), but we need it in radians for the formula.\n\n3. To convert degrees to radians, we use the relationship: \u03c0 radians = 180\u00b0\n\n4. Therefore, our next crucial step should be to convert 120\u00b0 to radians.\n\nThis conversion will allow us to proceed with applying the arc length formula in the subsequent steps. The acting agent should focus on performing this conversion accurately, as it's a critical component for solving the problem.\n",
