    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Circle centered at O with radius 10 units\n   - Points P and Q are on the circle\n   - Angle POQ is 120\u00b0\n\n2. Recall the formula for arc length:\n   Arc length = (central angle in radians) \u00d7 radius\n\n3. Convert the central angle from degrees to radians:\n   - 120\u00b0 needs to be converted to radians\n\n4. Apply the arc length formula:\n   - Use the converted angle and given radius\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Perform the necessary multiplication\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the circle's circumference\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection information and our previous steps, let's revise our reasoning for the final answer:\n\n1. We correctly calculated the arc length using the formula: Arc length = (central angle in radians) \u00d7 radius\n   Central angle in radians = (120 * \u03c0) / 180 = (2\u03c0) / 3\n   Radius = 10 units\n\n2. Therefore, the exact arc length is:\n   Arc length = ((2\u03c0) / 3) * 10 = (20\u03c0) / 3 units\n\n3. We should keep this answer in its exact form using \u03c0, rather than approximating it to a decimal value.\n\n4. To verify, we can compare this to the full circumference:\n   Full circumference = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0 * 10 = 20\u03c0 units\n   Our arc length (20\u03c0) / 3 is indeed 1/3 of the full circumference, which matches the 120\u00b0 angle (1/3 of 360\u00b0).\n\n5. The final answer should be expressed as (20\u03c0) / 3 units or simplified to (10\u03c0) / 3 units.\n\nThe acting agent should present this exact form as the final answer, emphasizing that it's preferable to keep \u03c0 in the expression for precision in geometric problems involving circles.\n",
