Recall the formula for arc length:\n   Arc length = (central angle in radians) \u00d7 radius\n\n3. Convert the central angle from degrees to radians:\n   - 120\u00b0 needs to be converted to radians\n\n4. Apply the arc length formula:\n   - Use the converted angle and given radius\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Perform the necessary multiplication\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the circle's circumference\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical action and our planning strategy, we have successfully converted the central angle from degrees to radians. The result of (120 * \u03c0) / 180 is approximately 2.09439510239320 radians.\n\nNow, we can proceed with the next crucial step in our problem-solving process:\n\n1. We have the central angle in radians: approximately 2.09439510239320 radians.\n2. We know the radius of the circle is 10 units.\n3. We can now apply the arc length formula: Arc length = (central angle in radians) \u00d7 radius\n\nTherefore, our next operation should be to multiply the central angle in radians (2.09439510239320) by the radius (10) to calculate the length of the arc PQ.\n\nThis calculation will give us the final answer to the problem. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this multiplication accurately.\n",
