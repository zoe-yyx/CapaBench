    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at X\n   - XZ = 5\n   - XY = 3XZ\n\n2. Calculate the length of XY:\n   - Use the given relationship XY = 3XZ\n   - Substitute the known value of XZ\n\n3. Recognize the triangle as a 3-4-5 right triangle scaled up:\n   - XZ corresponds to 3 in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n   - XY corresponds to 4 in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n   - YZ will correspond to 5 in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n\n4. Determine the scale factor:\n   - Compare the given XZ to the corresponding side in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n\n5. Calculate the length of YZ:\n   - Multiply the corresponding side in the basic 3-4-5 triangle by the scale factor\n\n6. Verify the result using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Square XY and XZ\n   - Add these squares\n   - Compare the sum to the square of YZ\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of YZ\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry knowledge and the properties of special right triangles.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the Pythagorean theorem verification process we've started, let's continue with the next steps:\n\n1. We've calculated XY^2 = 15^2 = 225\n\n2. Now, we need to calculate XZ^2. We know XZ = 5, so:\n   XZ^2 = 5^2 = 25\n\n3. Next, we'll add XY^2 and XZ^2:\n   225 + 25 = 250\n\n4. This sum should equal YZ^2 if our calculations are correct.\n\n5. We calculated YZ earlier as 8.33333333333333, so we need to square this value:\n   YZ^2 \u2248 8.33333333333333^2\n\n6. If the result of step 5 is very close to 250 (allowing for some rounding errors), it will confirm our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to calculate XZ^2, which is 5^2.\n",
