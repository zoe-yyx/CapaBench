    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at X\n   - XZ = 5\n   - XY = 3XZ\n\n2. Calculate the length of XY:\n   - Use the given relationship XY = 3XZ\n   - Substitute the known value of XZ\n\n3. Recognize the triangle as a 3-4-5 right triangle scaled up:\n   - XZ corresponds to 3 in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n   - XY corresponds to 4 in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n   - YZ will correspond to 5 in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n\n4. Determine the scale factor:\n   - Compare the given XZ to the corresponding side in the basic 3-4-5 triangle\n\n5. Calculate the length of YZ:\n   - Multiply the corresponding side in the basic 3-4-5 triangle by the scale factor\n\n6. Verify the result using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Square XY and XZ\n   - Add these squares\n   - Compare the sum to the square of YZ\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of YZ\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry knowledge and the properties of special right triangles.\n",

However, we've encountered a discrepancy:\n\nXY^2 + XZ^2 = 250\nYZ^2 \u2248 69.4444444444444\n\nThese values should be equal according to the Pythagorean theorem, but they are not.

Let's recalculate YZ using the Pythagorean theorem directly:\n\nYZ^2 = XY^2 + XZ^2 = 250\nYZ = \u221a250\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to calculate the square root of 250 to get the correct length of YZ. This will give us the accurate answer to the original problem.\n",
