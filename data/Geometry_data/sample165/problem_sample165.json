    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The midpoint M of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by M = ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2). Substituting the given points into the formula, M = ((3-2)/2, (-4+5)/2) = (1/2, 1/2). Therefore the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}",
