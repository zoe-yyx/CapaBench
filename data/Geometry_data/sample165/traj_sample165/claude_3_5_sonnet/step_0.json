    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a line segment with given endpoints\n   - We need to find the x-coordinate (abscissa) of the midpoint\n\n2. Recall the midpoint formula:\n   - The midpoint formula for a line segment is:\n     ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n   - We only need the x-coordinate, so we'll focus on (x1 + x2)/2\n\n3. Identify the coordinates:\n   - Point 1: (3, -4)\n   - Point 2: (-2, 5)\n\n4. Apply the midpoint formula:\n   - x-coordinate of midpoint = (x1 + x2)/2\n   - Substitute the values: (3 + (-2))/2\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Add the x-coordinates: 3 + (-2)\n   - Divide the result by 2\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the calculated value is reasonable\n   - It should be between the x-coordinates of the endpoints\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the abscissa (x-coordinate) of the midpoint\n",
