Visualize the rotation:\n   - Understand what a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation means\n   - Identify the rotation point (origin)\n\n3. Apply the rotation transformation:\n   - Use the rotation matrix for 90-degree counterclockwise rotation\n   - Transform each vertex of the original rectangle\n\n4. Identify the new rectangle:\n   - List the coordinates of the new vertices after rotation\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, let's guide the acting agent through the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the initial rectangle. We can see that the vertices are at (0,0), (6,0), (6,4), and (0,4). This forms a rectangle with a width of 6 units and a height of 4 units.\n\n2. To find the center of the original rectangle, we need to calculate the average of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately:\n   - Center x = (0 + 6 + 6 + 0) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3\n   - Center y = (0 + 0 + 4 + 4) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2\n   So, the center of the original rectangle is at (3, 2).\n\n3. Now, we need to apply a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation about the origin. This transformation can be achieved by using the rotation matrix:\n   (x', y') = (-y, x)\n\n4. Let's apply this transformation to each vertex:\n   (0, 0) -> (0, 0)\n   (6, 0) -> (0, -6)\n   (6, 4) -> (-4, -6)\n   (0, 4) -> (-4, 0)\n\n5. These new coordinates form the rotated rectangle. To find its center, we again calculate the average of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates:\n   - New center x = (0 + 0 + (-4) + (-4)) / 4 = -8 / 4 = -2\n   - New center y = (0 + (-6) + (-6) + 0) / 4 = -12 / 4 = -3\n\n6. The question asks for the abscissa of the center of the new rectangle, which is the x-coordinate. We've calculated this to be -2.\n\nThe acting agent should verify these calculations using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n",
