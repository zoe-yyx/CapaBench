Recall properties of isosceles triangles:\n   - The base angles are equal\n   - The sides opposite the equal angles are equal\n\n3. Identify the known side lengths:\n   - DF (10 cm) and DE (8 cm) are the equal sides\n   - EF is the base of the isosceles triangle\n\n4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Draw the altitude from vertex F to side DE\n   - This creates two right triangles\n\n5. Calculate half of DE:\n   - DE/2 = 8/2 = 4 cm\n\n6. Use Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle:\n   - (EF/2)^2 + h^2 = 10^2\n   - Where h is the height of the triangle\n\n7. Find h using Pythagorean theorem:\n   - h^2 = 10^2 - 4^2\n\n8. Substitute the value of h^2 into the equation from step 6\n\n9. Solve for EF\n\n10. Verify the answer using the triangle inequality theorem\n",

We've established that triangle DEF is isosceles with DF = DE = 10 cm and DE = 8 cm.\n\n2. The next logical step is to draw an altitude from vertex F to side DE. This will create two congruent right triangles, each with hypotenuse 10 cm and base 4 cm (half of DE).\n\n3. We can now use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height (h) of these right triangles:\n\n   10^2 = 4^2 + h^2\n\n4. To solve this, we need to calculate 10^2 and 4^2, then subtract 4^2 from 10^2 to find h^2.\n\n5. Once we have h^2, we can take the square root to find h.\n\n6. With h known, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again in one of these right triangles to find half of EF:\n\n   (EF/2)^2 = h^2 + 4^2\n\n7. Solving this equation will give us half of EF. We'll then need to double this result to get the full length of EF.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to start with calculating 10^2 and 4^2 using a calculator.\n",
