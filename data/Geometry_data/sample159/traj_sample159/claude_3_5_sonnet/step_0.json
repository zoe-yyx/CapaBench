Apply angle reduction:\n   - Use the fact that sine function repeats every 360\u00b0.\n   - Calculate 1080\u00b0 \u00f7 360\u00b0 to determine how many full rotations are in 1080\u00b0.\n   - Find the remainder to get the equivalent angle within one rotation.\n\n3. Identify special angle:\n   - Determine if the reduced angle is a common angle with known sine value.\n   - If not, consider further simplification using trigonometric identities.\n\n4. Calculate the sine:\n   - If it's a special angle, recall or look up its sine value.\n   - If not, use a calculator to compute the sine of the reduced angle.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense (between -1 and 1).\n   - Consider the quadrant of the angle to confirm the sign of the result.\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in its simplest form (if applicable).\n   - Provide the numeric value with appropriate precision.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we haven't taken any actions yet, let's start with the first step of angle reduction. We need to:\n\n1. Calculate how many full rotations are in 1080\u00b0.\n2. Find the remainder to get the equivalent angle within one rotation.\n\nTo do this, we should divide 1080\u00b0 by 360\u00b0 (which represents one full rotation). This will give us the number of full rotations and the remainder, which will be our equivalent angle.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division:\n\n1080 \u00f7 360\n\nThis calculation will give us the quotient (number of full rotations) and the remainder (our equivalent angle). Once we have this information, we can proceed to identify if the resulting angle is a special angle with a known sine value.\n",
