    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key properties of a rhombus:\n   - All sides are equal in length\n   - Opposite angles are congruent\n   - The sum of all interior angles is 360\u00b0\n   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - One acute angle of the rhombus is 60\u00b0\n\n3. Use the properties of a rhombus to determine the other angles:\n   - Since opposite angles are congruent, the other acute angle is also 60\u00b0\n   - The sum of all angles in a rhombus is 360\u00b0\n\n4. Calculate the measure of the obtuse angle:\n   - Set up an equation using the sum of angles in a rhombus\n   - Solve for the obtuse angle\n\n5. Verify the answer:\n   - Check that the sum of all angles equals 360\u00b0\n   - Ensure the obtuse angle is greater than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of the obtuse angle in degrees\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result from the previous action, we can now complete our reasoning:\n\n1. We calculated (360\u00b0 - 120\u00b0) / 2 = 120\u00b0\n\n2. This 120\u00b0 is the measure of each obtuse angle in the rhombus.\n\n3. Let's verify our answer:\n   - We have two acute angles of 60\u00b0 each and two obtuse angles of 120\u00b0 each.\n   - 60\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 360\u00b0, which confirms our result.\n\n4. This answer makes sense because:\n   - 120\u00b0 is indeed an obtuse angle (greater than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0)\n   - It's supplementary to the 60\u00b0 acute angle (60\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 180\u00b0)\n\n5. We can conclude that the measure of the obtuse angle in rhombus PQRS is 120\u00b0.\n\nThe next step should be to formally present this answer as the solution to the original problem.\n",
