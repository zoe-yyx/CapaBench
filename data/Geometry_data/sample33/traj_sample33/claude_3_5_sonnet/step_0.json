    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key properties of a rhombus:\n   - All sides are equal in length\n   - Opposite angles are congruent\n   - The sum of all interior angles is 360\u00b0\n   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - One acute angle of the rhombus is 60\u00b0\n\n3. Use the properties of a rhombus to determine the other angles:\n   - Since opposite angles are congruent, the other acute angle is also 60\u00b0\n   - The sum of all angles in a rhombus is 360\u00b0\n\n4. Calculate the measure of the obtuse angle:\n   - Set up an equation using the sum of angles in a rhombus\n   - Solve for the obtuse angle\n\n5. Verify the answer:\n   - Check that the sum of all angles equals 360\u00b0\n   - Ensure the obtuse angle is greater than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of the obtuse angle in degrees\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the properties of a rhombus, we can reason through this problem as follows:\n\n1. We know that one acute angle of the rhombus is 60\u00b0.\n\n2. In a rhombus, opposite angles are congruent. This means that the other acute angle is also 60\u00b0.\n\n3. We also know that the sum of all interior angles in a rhombus (or any quadrilateral) is 360\u00b0.\n\n4. Let's call the measure of each obtuse angle x\u00b0.\n\n5. We can set up an equation:\n   60\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + x\u00b0 + x\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n\n6. This simplifies to:\n   120\u00b0 + 2x\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n\n7. To solve for x, we need to:\n   - Subtract 120\u00b0 from both sides\n   - Divide both sides by 2\n\n8. Once we solve this equation, we'll have the measure of the obtuse angle.\n\nThe next step should be to perform these calculations to find the value of x.\n",
