    "observation": "Equilateral triangle $PQR$ has side length $7$. What is the perimeter of triangle $PQR$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have an equilateral triangle PQR\n   - The side length of the triangle is 7\n\n2. Recall the definition of an equilateral triangle:\n   - All sides of an equilateral triangle are equal in length\n\n3. Define the perimeter of a triangle:\n   - The perimeter is the sum of all side lengths\n\n4. Calculate the perimeter:\n   - Add up the lengths of all three sides\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - Ensure the units (if any) are included in the answer\n\nThis problem is straightforward and can likely be solved in one or two steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and planning strategy, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. We have an equilateral triangle PQR with side length 7.\n\n2. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal in length. This means that:\n   Side PQ = Side QR = Side RP = 7\n\n3. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its side lengths.\n\n4. To calculate the perimeter, we need to add the lengths of all three sides:\n   Perimeter = PQ + QR + RP = 7 + 7 + 7\n\n5. This calculation can be simplified to:\n   Perimeter = 3 \u00d7 7\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to perform this multiplication to find the perimeter of the triangle.\n",
