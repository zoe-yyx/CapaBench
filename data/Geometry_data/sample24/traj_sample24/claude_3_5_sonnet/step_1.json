    "observation": "Equilateral triangle $PQR$ has side length $7$. What is the perimeter of triangle $PQR$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have an equilateral triangle PQR\n   - The side length of the triangle is 7\n\n2. Recall the definition of an equilateral triangle:\n   - All sides of an equilateral triangle are equal in length\n\n3. Define the perimeter of a triangle:\n   - The perimeter is the sum of all side lengths\n\n4. Calculate the perimeter:\n   - Add up the lengths of all three sides\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - Ensure the units (if any) are included in the answer\n\nThis problem is straightforward and can likely be solved in one or two steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the information provided and the actions taken so far, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. The calculation 3 * 7 = 21 has been performed correctly using a calculator.\n\n2. This result, 21, represents the perimeter of the equilateral triangle PQR.\n\n3. The original question asked for the perimeter of triangle PQR, which we have now calculated.\n\n4. Since the side length was given as 7 without any specific units, we can assume that the perimeter is also in the same unspecified units.\n\n5. The problem has been fully solved, and no further calculations or actions are needed.\n\nThe next logical step would be to formulate the final answer, stating that the perimeter of triangle PQR is 21 units.\n",
