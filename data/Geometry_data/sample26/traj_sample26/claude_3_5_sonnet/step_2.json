    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle PQR\n   - PR = 9\n   - QR = 40\n   - PQ is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to our triangle:\n   - PR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n\n4. Calculate the squares:\n   - 81 + 1600 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 1681 = PQ\u00b2\n\n5. Find the square root of both sides:\n   - \u221a1681 = PQ\n\n6. Calculate the square root:\n   - PQ = 41\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 41\u00b2\n\n8. Conclude with the final answer:\n   - The length of PQ is 41\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use a calculator for the calculations in steps 4 and 6.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations we've performed so far, we have successfully determined the length of PQ, which is the hypotenuse of our right triangle PQR. Let's review our progress:\n\n1. We applied the Pythagorean theorem: PR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n2. We calculated 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 1681\n3. We found \u221a1681 = 41\n\nNow that we have the length of PQ as 41, we have effectively solved the original problem. However, it's always good practice to verify our result. We can do this by checking if the Pythagorean theorem holds true for our triangle with the calculated hypotenuse.\n\nTo verify, we should check if:\nPR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 41\u00b2\n\nWe already know that 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 1681, so we just need to calculate 41\u00b2 and compare it to 1681.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the calculator to compute 41\u00b2 (41 squared). This will allow us to verify our solution and ensure its correctness.\n",
