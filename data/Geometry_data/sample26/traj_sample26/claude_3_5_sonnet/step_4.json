    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle PQR\n   - PR = 9\n   - QR = 40\n   - PQ is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to our triangle:\n   - PR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n\n4. Calculate the squares:\n   - 81 + 1600 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 1681 = PQ\u00b2\n\n5. Find the square root of both sides:\n   - \u221a1681 = PQ\n\n6. Calculate the square root:\n   - PQ = 41\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 41\u00b2\n\n8. Conclude with the final answer:\n   - The length of PQ is 41\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use a calculator for the calculations in steps 4 and 6.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the reflection. You're absolutely correct that the reasoning and calculations were accurate, but the final presentation of the answer included unnecessary information. Let's address this and provide clear guidance for the acting agent.\n\nGiven that we have already solved the problem correctly and verified our answer, our next step should be to present the final answer in the most appropriate format. Here's the reasoning for the acting agent:\n\n1. We have successfully calculated that the length of PQ is 41 units.\n2. The original question asks, \"What is the length of PQ?\"\n3. To answer this question correctly and concisely, we should provide only the numerical value.\n4. We don't need to include the variable name \"PQ\" or any units in our final answer, as they were not specifically requested in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should simply state the numerical value 41 as the final answer. This approach ensures we're providing exactly what was asked for without any extraneous information that could potentially be misinterpreted.\n",
