    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle PQR\n   - PR = 9\n   - QR = 40\n   - PQ is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to our triangle:\n   - PR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n\n4. Calculate the squares:\n   - 81 + 1600 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 1681 = PQ\u00b2\n\n5. Find the square root of both sides:\n   - \u221a1681 = PQ\n\n6. Calculate the square root:\n   - PQ = 41\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 41\u00b2\n\n8. Conclude with the final answer:\n   - The length of PQ is 41\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use a calculator for the calculations in steps 4 and 6.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 1681, we have confirmed that PQ\u00b2 = 1681. The next logical step in our problem-solving process is to find the length of PQ, which is the square root of 1681.\n\nTo find the square root of 1681 accurately, we should use a calculator. This will give us the exact length of PQ, which is the hypotenuse of our right triangle.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to compute the square root of 1681. This calculation will directly give us the length of PQ, which is the answer to our original problem.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have the final answer and can verify if it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem for our given triangle dimensions.\n",
