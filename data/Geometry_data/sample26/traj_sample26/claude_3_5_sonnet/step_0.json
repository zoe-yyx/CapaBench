    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle PQR\n   - PR = 9\n   - QR = 40\n   - PQ is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to our triangle:\n   - PR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n\n4. Calculate the squares:\n   - 81 + 1600 = PQ\u00b2\n   - 1681 = PQ\u00b2\n\n5. Find the square root of both sides:\n   - \u221a1681 = PQ\n\n6. Calculate the square root:\n   - PQ = 41\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if 9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = 41\u00b2\n\n8. Conclude with the final answer:\n   - The length of PQ is 41\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use a calculator for the calculations in steps 4 and 6.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe should begin by applying the Pythagorean theorem to our right triangle PQR. We know that PR = 9 and QR = 40, and PQ is the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\nPR\u00b2 + QR\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n9\u00b2 + 40\u00b2 = PQ\u00b2\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate the squares of PR and QR, and then sum them up. This will give us the square of PQ. To do this accurately and efficiently, we should use a calculator.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n1. 9\u00b2 (9 squared)\n2. 40\u00b2 (40 squared)\n3. The sum of these two results\n\nThis calculation will give us the value of PQ\u00b2, from which we can then determine the length of PQ in the subsequent steps.\n",
