    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the initial setup:\n   - Square ABCD with side length 10\n   - Initial position: A(0,0), B(10,0)\n   - Rotation of 45 degrees around vertex A\n\n2. Recall relevant formulas:\n   - Rotation matrix for 45 degrees clockwise: \n     [cos(45\u00b0)  sin(45\u00b0)]\n     [-sin(45\u00b0) cos(45\u00b0)]\n\n3. Apply the rotation:\n   - Use the rotation matrix to transform point B\n   - Remember that cos(45\u00b0) = sin(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2\n\n4. Calculate the new coordinates:\n   - Apply the rotation matrix to vector AB (10,0)\n   - Determine the new x-coordinate (abscissa) of point B\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Simplify any square roots if possible\n   - Round the result to an appropriate number of decimal places if needed\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense geometrically\n   - Ensure the new position of B is consistent with a 45-degree rotation\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the abscissa of point B after rotation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo determine the abscissa of point B after rotation, we need to apply the rotation matrix to the initial coordinates of point B. Let's break this down:\n\n1. We know that point B starts at (10, 0) relative to point A at (0, 0).\n\n2. The rotation matrix for a 45-degree clockwise rotation is:\n   [cos(45\u00b0)  sin(45\u00b0)]\n   [-sin(45\u00b0) cos(45\u00b0)]\n\n3. We know that cos(45\u00b0) = sin(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2\n\n4. To find the new coordinates, we multiply the rotation matrix by the vector AB:\n   [\u221a2/2   \u221a2/2] * [10]\n   [-\u221a2/2  \u221a2/2]   [0]\n\n5. This multiplication will give us the new x and y coordinates of B relative to A.\n\n6. The x-coordinate (abscissa) we're looking for will be the result of:\n   (\u221a2/2 * 10) + (\u221a2/2 * 0)\n\n7. We need to simplify this expression to get our final answer.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to perform this calculation. The acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n(\u221a2/2 * 10)\n\nThis will give us the abscissa of point B after rotation.\n",
