    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of a trapezoid is given by $\\frac{1}{2} (b_1+b_2)h$ where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides and $h$ is the height. Plugging in the values, we have $\\frac{1}{2} (10+20) \\times 15 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 \\times 15 = 225$ square cm. \\(\\boxed{225}\\)",
