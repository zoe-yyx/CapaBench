    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Isosceles Right Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is an isosceles right triangle\n   - XY = XZ (isosceles property)\n   - XY = 7\u221a2\n\n2. Recall key properties of isosceles right triangles:\n   - The right angle is opposite the hypotenuse\n   - The two non-right angles are equal, each measuring 45\u00b0\n\n3. Determine the location of the right angle:\n   - Since XY = XZ, the right angle must be at Y or Z\n   - Let's assume the right angle is at Z\n\n4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   - Here, YZ is the hypotenuse, and XY and XZ are the other two sides\n\n5. Set up the Pythagorean equation:\n   - (XY)\u00b2 + (XZ)\u00b2 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n6. Substitute known values:\n   - (7\u221a2)\u00b2 + (7\u221a2)\u00b2 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n7. Simplify and solve for YZ:\n   - Calculate (7\u221a2)\u00b2\n   - Add the two equal terms\n   - Take the square root of both sides\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense geometrically\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of YZ\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and alternative methods if time permits.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry and algebra skills.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation and our problem-solving strategy, let's continue our reasoning:\n\n1. We've calculated that (7\u221a2)\u00b2 = 98.\n\n2. In our Pythagorean theorem equation, we have:\n   (7\u221a2)\u00b2 + (7\u221a2)\u00b2 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n3. Now that we know (7\u221a2)\u00b2 = 98, we can substitute this value:\n   98 + 98 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n4. The next logical step is to add these values on the left side of the equation:\n   196 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n5. To solve for YZ, we need to take the square root of both sides:\n   \u221a196 = YZ\n\n6. The square root of 196 is a whole number, which will give us the exact length of YZ.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the acting agent should now use a calculator to compute the square root of 196. This will give us the final answer for the length of YZ.\n",
