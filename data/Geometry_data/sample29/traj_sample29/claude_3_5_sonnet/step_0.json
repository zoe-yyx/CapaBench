    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Isosceles Right Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is an isosceles right triangle\n   - XY = XZ (isosceles property)\n   - XY = 7\u221a2\n\n2. Recall key properties of isosceles right triangles:\n   - The right angle is opposite the hypotenuse\n   - The two non-right angles are equal, each measuring 45\u00b0\n\n3. Determine the location of the right angle:\n   - Since XY = XZ, the right angle must be at Y or Z\n   - Let's assume the right angle is at Z\n\n4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   - Here, YZ is the hypotenuse, and XY and XZ are the other two sides\n\n5. Set up the Pythagorean equation:\n   - (XY)\u00b2 + (XZ)\u00b2 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n6. Substitute known values:\n   - (7\u221a2)\u00b2 + (7\u221a2)\u00b2 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n7. Simplify and solve for YZ:\n   - Calculate (7\u221a2)\u00b2\n   - Add the two equal terms\n   - Take the square root of both sides\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense geometrically\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of YZ\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and alternative methods if time permits.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry and algebra skills.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the original problem, let's start our reasoning process:\n\n1. We've established that XYZ is an isosceles right triangle with XY = XZ = 7\u221a2.\n\n2. In an isosceles right triangle, the right angle is opposite the hypotenuse. Since XY = XZ, the right angle must be at Z, making YZ the hypotenuse.\n\n3. We can apply the Pythagorean theorem to solve for YZ. The theorem states that in a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse.\n\n4. In our case, this translates to: (XY)\u00b2 + (XZ)\u00b2 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n5. We know that XY = XZ = 7\u221a2, so we can substitute these values:\n   (7\u221a2)\u00b2 + (7\u221a2)\u00b2 = (YZ)\u00b2\n\n6. The next logical step would be to simplify the left side of this equation. We need to calculate (7\u221a2)\u00b2 and then double it.\n\n7. After simplifying, we can solve for YZ by taking the square root of both sides.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the acting agent should focus on calculating (7\u221a2)\u00b2 as the next step. This will involve squaring 7\u221a2 and then doubling the result.\n",
