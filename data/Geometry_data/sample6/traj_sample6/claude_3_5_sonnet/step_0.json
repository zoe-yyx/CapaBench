Recall the basic trigonometric values:\n   - Remind the team about the common angle values for cosine, including 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0.\n\n2. Focus on the specific value of 90\u00b0:\n   - Highlight that 90\u00b0 is a right angle and has special significance in trigonometry.\n\n3. Visualize a unit circle:\n   - Suggest drawing or imagining a unit circle to understand the geometric interpretation of cosine at 90\u00b0.\n\n4. Identify the cosine definition in terms of the unit circle:\n   - Recall that cosine represents the x-coordinate on the unit circle.\n\n5. Locate the position of 90\u00b0 on the unit circle:\n   - Note that 90\u00b0 corresponds to the point (0, 1) on the unit circle.\n\n6. Conclude the value of cos 90\u00b0:\n   - Based on the x-coordinate at 90\u00b0 on the unit circle, determine the final answer.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Use a calculator or search engine to confirm the value of cos 90\u00b0.\n\n8. Reflect on the significance:\n   - Discuss why cos 90\u00b0 has this particular value and its importance in trigonometry.\n\nThis plan should lead to a quick and accurate solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo compute cos 90\u00b0, we should start by recalling the fundamental concept of the unit circle in trigonometry. In the unit circle, cosine represents the x-coordinate of a point on the circle for a given angle.\n\nFor 90\u00b0, we know this corresponds to a quarter turn counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. At this point:\n\n1. The angle is at the top of the circle.\n2. The x-coordinate is 0.\n3. The y-coordinate is 1.\n\nSince cosine is defined as the x-coordinate on the unit circle, and at 90\u00b0 the x-coordinate is 0, we can conclude that cos 90\u00b0 = 0.\n\nTo verify this result, we should use a calculator or search engine to confirm the value of cos 90\u00b0.\n",
