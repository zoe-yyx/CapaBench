    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF\n   - Triangle ABC sides: 3, 4, and 5\n   - Triangle DEF shortest side: 9\n\n2. Recognize that similar triangles have proportional sides:\n   - Establish the ratio between corresponding sides of the two triangles\n\n3. Determine the scale factor:\n   - Compare the shortest side of DEF (9) to the shortest side of ABC (3)\n   - Calculate the scale factor: 9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n4. Apply the scale factor to find the other sides of triangle DEF:\n   - Multiply each side of triangle ABC by the scale factor\n\n5. Identify the longest side of triangle DEF:\n   - Compare the calculated sides to determine the longest\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Ensure the calculated sides maintain the same proportions as triangle ABC\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the longest side of triangle DEF\n\nNote: This plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should start by determining the scale factor between the two similar triangles. This is a crucial step that will allow us to calculate the dimensions of triangle DEF.\n\nWe know that the shortest side of triangle ABC is 3, and the shortest side of triangle DEF is 9. To find the scale factor, we need to divide the length of the shortest side of DEF by the length of the shortest side of ABC:\n\nScale factor = 9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\nThis means that triangle DEF is 3 times larger than triangle ABC in all dimensions. \n\nNow that we have the scale factor, we can use it to calculate the lengths of the other sides of triangle DEF. Since triangle ABC has sides of 3, 4, and 5, we need to multiply each of these lengths by the scale factor of 3.\n\nThe next logical step would be to perform these calculations to determine all side lengths of triangle DEF. Once we have all the side lengths, we can easily identify which one is the longest.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 3, 4, and 5 by the scale factor of 3 to find the corresponding side lengths of triangle DEF.\n",
