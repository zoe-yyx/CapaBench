    "planning_context": "\n1. Define what an axis of symmetry means for a letter.\n\n2. List out all the letters in the word 'SYMMETRY'.\n\n3. For each letter in 'SYMMETRY':\n   a. Analyze if it has an axis of symmetry.\n   b. Keep a count of letters with an axis of symmetry.\n\n4. Sum up the total count of letters with an axis of symmetry.\n\n5. Present the final answer.\n\nNote: This problem doesn't require complex calculations, so the calculator may not be needed. However, if there's any uncertainty about which letters have an axis of symmetry, the search engine can be used to verify.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for providing the search results, but it seems the search didn't return the specific information we were looking for about letters with axes of symmetry. Let's adjust our approach and reason through this problem using our general knowledge:\n\n1. We have already defined what an axis of symmetry means for a letter.\n\n2. We have listed out the letters in 'SYMMETRY': S, Y, M, M, E, T, R, Y\n\n3. Now, let's analyze each letter for axis of symmetry:\n\n   S - Has no clear axis of symmetry\n   Y - Has a vertical axis of symmetry\n   M - Has a vertical axis of symmetry\n   E - Has a horizontal axis of symmetry\n   T - Has a vertical axis of symmetry\n   R - Has no clear axis of symmetry\n   \n4. For the letters we're less certain about (S and R), it would be helpful to verify.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Confirm our analysis of the letters we're certain about (Y, M, E, T).\n2. Specifically search for information about whether S and R have any axes of symmetry.\n3. Once confirmed, count the total number of letters in 'SYMMETRY' that have an axis of symmetry.\n\nThis approach will allow us to accurately solve the problem without relying on a comprehensive list of all alphabet letters with symmetry.\n",
