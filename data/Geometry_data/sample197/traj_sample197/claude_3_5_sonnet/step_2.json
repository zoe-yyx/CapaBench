    "planning_context": "\n1. Define what an axis of symmetry means for a letter.\n\n2. List out all the letters in the word 'SYMMETRY'.\n\n3. For each letter in 'SYMMETRY':\n   a. Analyze if it has an axis of symmetry.\n   b. Keep a count of letters with an axis of symmetry.\n\n4. Sum up the total count of letters with an axis of symmetry.\n\n5. Present the final answer.\n\nNote: This problem doesn't require complex calculations, so the calculator may not be needed. However, if there's any uncertainty about which letters have an axis of symmetry, the search engine can be used to verify.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current situation and our previous attempts, it seems we're having difficulty getting specific information about letter symmetry from the search engine. Let's adapt our approach and use our reasoning skills to solve this problem:\n\n1. We've already identified that Y, M, E, and T have clear axes of symmetry.\n\n2. We were uncertain about S and R.\n\n3. Let's analyze these uncertain letters:\n   S - Upon closer consideration, S does not have an axis of symmetry. If we try to fold it vertically or horizontally, the halves do not match perfectly.\n   R - R also does not have an axis of symmetry. The curved part and the leg make it asymmetrical.\n\n4. Now, let's count the letters with an axis of symmetry in 'SYMMETRY':\n   Y - has symmetry\n   M - has symmetry (appears twice)\n   E - has symmetry\n   T - has symmetry\n\n5. To finalize our answer, we should count how many of these letters appear in the word 'SYMMETRY'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Count the occurrences of Y, M, E, and T in the word 'SYMMETRY'.\n2. Sum up these occurrences to get the total number of letters with an axis of symmetry.\n\nThis approach will allow us to solve the problem accurately using our own analysis and reasoning, without needing external verification.\n",
