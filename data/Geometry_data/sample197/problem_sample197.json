    "problem": "In the word 'SYMMETRY', how many letters have axis of symmetry?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The letters Y, M, E, and T have axis of symmetry. Counting these, we find there are $\\boxed{6}$ letters with axis of symmetry (since 'M' and 'Y' appear more than once).",
