    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Trapezoid Problem:\n\n1. Recall the definition and properties of a trapezoid:\n   - A trapezoid has two parallel sides (bases)\n   - The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases\n   - The length of the midsegment is the average of the parallel sides\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - AB = 3 (one parallel side)\n   - CD = 7 (other parallel side)\n   - AD = 4 (one of the non-parallel sides)\n\n3. Apply the midsegment theorem for trapezoids:\n   - The midsegment length = (AB + CD) / 2\n\n4. Calculate the midsegment length:\n   - Substitute the known values into the formula\n   - Use a calculator if needed for precise calculation\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the calculated length is between 3 and 7\n   - Check if the result is a whole number or a fraction\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the midsegment clearly\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution efficiently, likely within 2-3 rounds of action. The key is applying the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, which directly relates to the given information and the question asked.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the information provided in the original problem, we can proceed directly to applying the midsegment theorem for trapezoids. The key reasoning here is:\n\n1. We have all the necessary information to calculate the length of the midsegment.\n2. The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n3. In this case, we know that AB = 3 and CD = 7, which are the lengths of the parallel sides.\n\nTherefore, we can guide the acting agent to calculate the length of the midsegment using the formula:\n\nMidsegment length = (AB + CD) / 2\n\nThis calculation will directly give us the answer to the problem. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this simple arithmetic operation for precision.\n",
