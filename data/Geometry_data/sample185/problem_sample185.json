    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of a kite is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2$ where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals, which intersect at right angles. Therefore, the area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 \\times 12 = 108$ square cm. \\(\\boxed{108}\\)",
