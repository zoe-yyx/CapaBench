    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a kite ABCD\n   - Diagonal AC = 18 cm\n   - Diagonal BD = 12 cm\n   - The diagonals intersect at right angles\n\n2. Recall the formula for the area of a kite:\n   - Area of a kite = (d1 * d2) / 2\n   - Where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals\n\n3. Apply the formula using the given measurements:\n   - d1 = AC = 18 cm\n   - d2 = BD = 12 cm\n\n4. Calculate the area:\n   - Area = (18 * 12) / 2\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Multiply 18 by 12\n   - Divide the result by 2\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in square centimeters (cm\u00b2)\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the units are properly stated\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the formula for the area of a kite. We have all the necessary information:\n\n1. The kite's diagonals are AC = 18 cm and BD = 12 cm.\n2. The diagonals intersect at right angles, which confirms we can use the standard kite area formula.\n3. The formula for the area of a kite is: Area = (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nOur next step should be to substitute the values into the formula and perform the calculation. We need to:\n\n1. Multiply the lengths of the diagonals: 18 cm * 12 cm\n2. Divide the result by 2\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations accurately. After this, we'll have the final area of the kite in square centimeters.\n",
