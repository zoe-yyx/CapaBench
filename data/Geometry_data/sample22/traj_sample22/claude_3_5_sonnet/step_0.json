    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle XYZ\n   - Leg XY = 3\n   - Leg XZ = 4\n   - We need to find the length of hypotenuse YZ\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Let YZ = c (the hypotenuse)\n   - XY\u00b2 + XZ\u00b2 = YZ\u00b2\n   - 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   - 9 + 16 = c\u00b2\n   - 25 = c\u00b2\n\n5. Solve for c:\n   - Take the square root of both sides\n   - c = \u221a25\n\n6. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator to compute \u221a25\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated value satisfies the Pythagorean theorem\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of hypotenuse YZ\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that no actions have been taken yet, we should start by applying the Pythagorean theorem to our given information. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nWe know that:\n- XY (one leg) = 3\n- XZ (other leg) = 4\n- YZ is the hypotenuse we're trying to find\n\nLet's apply the Pythagorean theorem:\nYZ\u00b2 = XY\u00b2 + XZ\u00b2\n\nNow we need to substitute the known values:\nYZ\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2\n\nThe next step would be to calculate the squares and add them together. This will give us the square of the hypotenuse length. After that, we'll need to take the square root of this sum to find the actual length of the hypotenuse.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations:\n1. Calculate 3\u00b2 (3 squared)\n2. Calculate 4\u00b2 (4 squared)\n3. Add these results together\n4. Take the square root of this sum\n\nThis will give us the length of the hypotenuse YZ.\n",
