    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle XYZ\n   - Leg XY = 3\n   - Leg XZ = 4\n   - We need to find the length of hypotenuse YZ\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Let YZ = c (the hypotenuse)\n   - XY\u00b2 + XZ\u00b2 = YZ\u00b2\n   - 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   - 9 + 16 = c\u00b2\n   - 25 = c\u00b2\n\n5. Solve for c:\n   - Take the square root of both sides\n   - c = \u221a25\n\n6. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator to compute \u221a25\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated value satisfies the Pythagorean theorem\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of hypotenuse YZ\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the result from the calculator, we have successfully calculated that 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 25. This confirms that we're on the right track with our application of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nNow, we need to proceed to the next step in our solution strategy. We have established that YZ\u00b2 = 25, where YZ is the length of the hypotenuse we're trying to find.\n\nTo find YZ, we need to take the square root of both sides of this equation. Therefore, the next logical step is to calculate the square root of 25.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute the square root of 25. This will give us the exact length of the hypotenuse YZ.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have our final answer for the length of the hypotenuse. It's worth noting that we might expect a whole number result, given that 25 is a perfect square.\n",
