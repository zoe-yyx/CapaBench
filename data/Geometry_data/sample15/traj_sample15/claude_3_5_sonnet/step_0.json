    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem type:\n   - This is a distance calculation problem between two points on a coordinate plane.\n\n2. Recall the distance formula:\n   - The distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\n     d = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\n3. Extract the given information:\n   - Point K: (4, 7)\n   - Point M: (13, 7)\n\n4. Apply the distance formula:\n   - Substitute the coordinates into the formula\n   - Simplify the expression inside the square root\n\n5. Calculate the result:\n   - Evaluate the expression under the square root\n   - Calculate the final square root\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the coordinates\n   - Consider if there's a simpler way to verify (e.g., visual inspection of coordinates)\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the distance between points K and M\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we can reason through the problem as follows:\n\n1. We have two points: K(4, 7) and M(13, 7).\n\n2. Looking at these coordinates, we can observe that both points have the same y-coordinate (7). This simplifies our calculation significantly.\n\n3. When two points have the same y-coordinate, they lie on a horizontal line. The distance between them is simply the absolute difference of their x-coordinates.\n\n4. Therefore, we don't need to use the full distance formula in this case. We can simply calculate:\n   |x2 - x1| = |13 - 4|\n\n5. This simplification will make our calculation easier and quicker.\n\n6. The next step should be to calculate this difference and determine the absolute value.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we should guide the acting agent to perform a simple subtraction and determine the absolute value of the result.\n",
