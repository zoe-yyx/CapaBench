    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Draw a circle with center O and radius 5\n   - Mark points A and B on the circle\n   - Draw radius OA and OB, forming a right angle\n\n2. Identify the key information:\n   - Circle radius = 5\n   - \u2220AOB = 90\u00b0\n   - We need to find the length of chord AB\n\n3. Recognize the geometric relationship:\n   - The triangle AOB is a right triangle\n   - Chord AB is the hypotenuse of this right triangle\n\n4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   - Here, OA and OB are radii (legs), AB is hypotenuse\n\n5. Set up the equation:\n   - OA\u00b2 + OB\u00b2 = AB\u00b2\n   - 5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 = AB\u00b2\n\n6. Solve for AB:\n   - Calculate 5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2\n   - Take the square root of the result\n\n7. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense geometrically\n   - Confirm it's less than the diameter (10) but greater than the radius (5)\n\n8. Round and finalize:\n   - Round to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n   - Present the final answer for the length of chord AB\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we should guide the acting agent to follow these steps for reasoning:\n\n1. We know that the triangle AOB is a right triangle, with OA and OB being radii of the circle (both equal to 5), and AB being the chord we need to find.\n\n2. We can apply the Pythagorean theorem to this right triangle. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.\n\n3. In this case, AB is the hypotenuse, and OA and OB are the other two sides. So we can set up the equation:\n\n   AB\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 + OB\u00b2\n\n4. We know that OA = OB = 5 (the radius of the circle). So we can substitute these values:\n\n   AB\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2\n\n5. The next step would be to calculate 5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2. We should guide the acting agent to use a calculator for this calculation.\n\n6. After that, we'll need to take the square root of the result to find the length of AB.\n\n7. Finally, we should verify that our answer makes sense geometrically (it should be less than the diameter but greater than the radius of the circle).\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to start with calculating 5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 using a calculator.\n",
