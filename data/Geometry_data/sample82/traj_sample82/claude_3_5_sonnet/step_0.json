    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the area of a rhombus:\n   - Area = (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Diagonal 1 (d1) = 10\n   - Diagonal 2 (d2) = 24\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute the known values into the area formula\n   - Calculate the result using a calculator if needed\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the calculated area of the rhombus\n\n5. Optional: Verify the result\n   - Check if the answer seems reasonable given the dimensions\n   - Consider rounding if necessary\n\nThis plan should lead to a straightforward solution within 1-2 rounds, as the problem provides all necessary information and requires a simple calculation using a well-known formula.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and planning strategy, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have all the necessary information to solve this problem directly.\n2. The formula for the area of a rhombus is Area = (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n3. We know that:\n   - Diagonal 1 (d1) = 10\n   - Diagonal 2 (d2) = 24\n4. The next logical step is to substitute these values into the formula and perform the calculation.\n5. This calculation can be done using a basic calculator.\n6. After calculating, we should have the final area of the rhombus.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to perform the following calculation:\n(10 * 24) / 2\n\nThis will give us the area of the rhombus in square units.\n",
