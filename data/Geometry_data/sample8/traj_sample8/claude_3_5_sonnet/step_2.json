Remember the exact value of $\\tan 30^\\circ$:\n   - If not immediately recalled, consider deriving it from other known trigonometric ratios.\n\n3. If the exact value is not remembered:\n   a) Recall the relationship between sine, cosine, and tangent:\n      - $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$\n   b) Remember the exact values for $\\sin 30^\\circ$ and $\\cos 30^\\circ$:\n      - $\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$\n      - $\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n4. Compute $\\tan 30^\\circ$ using the ratio of sine to cosine:\n   - $\\tan 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sin 30^\\circ}{\\cos 30^\\circ} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$\n\n5. Simplify the fraction:\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate fractions.\n   - Further simplify if necessary.\n\n6. Present the final answer in its simplest form.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Use a calculator to compute $\\tan 30^\\circ$ and compare with our derived exact value.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous actions and the planning strategy, we have successfully derived and verified the exact value of tan 30\u00b0. Let's analyze our progress:\n\n1. We initially calculated (1/2) / (\u221a3/2) using a calculator, which gave us 0.577350269189626.\n2. We then reasoned that this could be simplified to \u221a3/3, which is the exact value of tan 30\u00b0.\n3. To verify this result, we used a calculator to compute tan(\u03c0/6) [note that 30\u00b0 = \u03c0/6 radians], which gave us 0.577350269189626.\n\nThe fact that the calculator result for tan(\u03c0/6) matches our initial calculation confirms that our reasoning was correct. The exact value \u221a3/3 is indeed equivalent to this decimal approximation.\n\nAt this point, we have successfully solved the problem. We have:\n1. Derived the exact value of tan 30\u00b0 as \u221a3/3.\n2. Verified this result using a calculator.\n\nThe next logical step would be to formulate a clear and concise final answer, including both the exact value and its decimal approximation. This will provide a complete solution to the original problem.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should now focus on presenting the final answer in a clear and organized manner, stating both the exact value (\u221a3/3) and its decimal approximation (approximately 0.5774).\n",
