    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the special angle values:\n   - 30\u00b0 is a common angle in trigonometry with known exact values.\n\n2. Remember the exact value of $\\tan 30^\\circ$:\n   - If not immediately recalled, consider deriving it from other known trigonometric ratios.\n\n3. If the exact value is not remembered:\n   a) Recall the relationship between sine, cosine, and tangent:\n      - $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$\n   b) Remember the exact values for $\\sin 30^\\circ$ and $\\cos 30^\\circ$:\n      - $\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$\n      - $\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n4. Compute $\\tan 30^\\circ$ using the ratio of sine to cosine:\n   - $\\tan 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sin 30^\\circ}{\\cos 30^\\circ} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$\n\n5. Simplify the fraction:\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate fractions.\n   - Further simplify if necessary.\n\n6. Present the final answer in its simplest form.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Use a calculator to compute $\\tan 30^\\circ$ and compare with our derived exact value.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation and our planning strategy, we have made good progress. The calculator result of 0.577350269189626 for (1/2) / (\u221a3/2) is correct, but we need to express this as an exact value rather than a decimal approximation.\n\nLet's analyze this result:\n\n1. We calculated (1/2) / (\u221a3/2), which is equivalent to (1/2) * (2/\u221a3).\n\n2. This can be simplified by cancelling out the 2's:\n   (1/2) * (2/\u221a3) = 1/\u221a3\n\n3. However, it's common to rationalize the denominator in mathematical expressions. To do this, we multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a3:\n\n   (1/\u221a3) * (\u221a3/\u221a3) = \u221a3/3\n\nTherefore, our reasoning suggests that the exact value of tan 30\u00b0 is \u221a3/3.\n\nThe next step should be to verify this result. We can do this by:\n\n1. Squaring our result (\u221a3/3)^2 and comparing it to the known value of tan^2 30\u00b0, which is 1/3.\n2. Using the calculator to compute tan 30\u00b0 in degrees and comparing it to our \u221a3/3 expressed as a decimal.\n\nThese verification steps will ensure our derived exact value is correct.\n",
