Remember the exact value of $\\tan 30^\\circ$:\n   - If not immediately recalled, consider deriving it from other known trigonometric ratios.\n\n3. If the exact value is not remembered:\n   a) Recall the relationship between sine, cosine, and tangent:\n      - $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$\n   b) Remember the exact values for $\\sin 30^\\circ$ and $\\cos 30^\\circ$:\n      - $\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$\n      - $\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n4. Compute $\\tan 30^\\circ$ using the ratio of sine to cosine:\n   - $\\tan 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sin 30^\\circ}{\\cos 30^\\circ} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$\n\n5. Simplify the fraction:\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate fractions.\n   - Further simplify if necessary.\n\n6. Present the final answer in its simplest form.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Use a calculator to compute $\\tan 30^\\circ$ and compare with our derived exact value.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that no historical actions have been taken yet, we should start by recalling the exact value of tan 30\u00b0. This is a fundamental trigonometric value that is often memorized.\n\nHowever, if we cannot immediately recall the exact value, we should proceed with deriving it using the relationship between sine, cosine, and tangent. We know that:\n\ntan \u03b8 = sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8\n\nFor 30\u00b0, we have the following exact values:\nsin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\ncos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n\nUsing these, we can calculate tan 30\u00b0 as follows:\ntan 30\u00b0 = (1/2) / (\u221a3/2)\n\nThe next step would be to simplify this fraction. To do this, we should multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the fractions in the denominator.\n\nAfter simplification, we should arrive at the exact value of tan 30\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with these calculations, starting with the division of sin 30\u00b0 by cos 30\u00b0, and then simplifying the result.\n",
