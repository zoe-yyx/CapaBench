    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rectangle Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - The rectangle is divided into four identical squares\n   - Each square has an area of 16 square units\n\n2. Calculate the side length of each square:\n   - Use the formula: Area of a square = side length^2\n   - Side length = \u221a(Area) = \u221a16\n\n3. Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:\n   - Width = side length of one square\n   - Length = side length of two squares (since there are four squares in total)\n\n4. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:\n   - Use the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width)\n   - Substitute the values found in steps 2 and 3\n\n5. Simplify and provide the final answer:\n   - Ensure the answer is in square units\n   - Double-check calculations for accuracy\n\nThis plan should allow the team to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for the square root and final perimeter calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the side length of each square, which is 4 units, we can proceed with determining the dimensions of the rectangle:\n\n1. Width of the rectangle:\n   The width is equal to the side length of one square, which is 4 units.\n\n2. Length of the rectangle:\n   The length is equal to the side length of two squares, as the rectangle is divided into four identical squares (2x2 configuration).\n   So, the length is 4 * 2 = 8 units.\n\nWith these dimensions, we can now calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:\nPerimeter = 2(length + width)\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n2 * (8 + 4)\n\nThis calculation will give us the perimeter of the original rectangle in units.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have our final answer and can conclude the problem-solving process.\n",
