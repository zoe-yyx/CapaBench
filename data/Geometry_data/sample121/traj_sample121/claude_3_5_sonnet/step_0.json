    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rectangle Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - The rectangle is divided into four identical squares\n   - Each square has an area of 16 square units\n\n2. Calculate the side length of each square:\n   - Use the formula: Area of a square = side length^2\n   - Side length = \u221a(Area) = \u221a16\n\n3. Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:\n   - Width = side length of one square\n   - Length = side length of two squares (since there are four squares in total)\n\n4. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:\n   - Use the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width)\n   - Substitute the values found in steps 2 and 3\n\n5. Simplify and provide the final answer:\n   - Ensure the answer is in square units\n   - Double-check calculations for accuracy\n\nThis plan should allow the team to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for the square root and final perimeter calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we haven't taken any actions yet, our first step should be to calculate the side length of each square. We know that the area of each square is 16 square units. To find the side length, we need to take the square root of 16.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n\u221a16\n\nThis calculation will give us the side length of each square, which is a crucial piece of information for determining the dimensions of the rectangle and ultimately calculating its perimeter.\n\nOnce we have this value, we can proceed to determine the width and length of the rectangle in the next step.\n",
