    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The length of the arc formed by an angle $\\theta = 120^\\circ$ in a circle of radius $r = 15$ cm is given by $L = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\cdot 2\\pi r = \\frac{120}{360} \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot 15 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 30\\pi = 10\\pi$ cm. \\(\\boxed{10\\pi}\\)",
