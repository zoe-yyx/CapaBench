    "problem": "The vertices of the rectangle are located at $P(1,3), Q(5,3), R(5,1), S(1,1)$. What is the ordinate of the midpoint of the diagonal $PR$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The coordinates of $P$ are $(1,3)$ and $R$ are $(5,1)$. The midpoint of segment $PR$ can be found using the midpoint formula: $\\left(\\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{3+1}{2}\\right) = (3, 2)$. Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
