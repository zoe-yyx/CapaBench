Determine the coordinates of P and R:\n   - P(1,3)\n   - R(5,1)\n\n3. Calculate the midpoint of diagonal PR:\n   - Use the midpoint formula: ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n   - x-coordinate: (1 + 5)/2\n   - y-coordinate: (3 + 1)/2\n\n4. Extract the ordinate (y-coordinate) from the midpoint:\n   - The ordinate is the y-coordinate calculated in step 3\n\n5. Perform necessary calculations:\n   - Use a calculator to compute the final result if needed\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense within the context of the rectangle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the ordinate of the midpoint of diagonal PR\n",
