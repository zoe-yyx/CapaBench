    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Right triangle MNP with right angle at M\n   - MQ is perpendicular to hypotenuse NP\n   - MQ = 4 cm\n   - Area of triangle MQP = 8 cm^2\n\n2. Identify key relationships:\n   - MQ divides the original triangle into two smaller right triangles\n   - Triangle MQP is one of these smaller right triangles\n\n3. Calculate the length of QP:\n   - Use the formula: Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n   - Substitute known values: 8 = (1/2) * QP * 4\n   - Solve for QP\n\n4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle MQP:\n   - MQ^2 + QP^2 = MP^2\n   - Substitute known values and solve for MP\n\n5. Use the similarity of triangles:\n   - Triangles MNP and MQP are similar\n   - Set up a proportion to find NP\n\n6. Solve the proportion:\n   - Substitute known values\n   - Calculate the length of NP\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated NP satisfies all given conditions\n\n8. Round the answer if necessary and present the final result\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometric principles and algebraic calculations.\n",
