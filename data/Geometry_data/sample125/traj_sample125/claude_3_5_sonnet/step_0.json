    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the area of a rhombus:\n   - Area = (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Diagonal 1 (d1) = 10 units\n   - Diagonal 2 (d2) = 24 units\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute the known values into the formula\n   - Calculate the result using a calculator if needed\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the area in square units\n   - Round the result if necessary (depending on the required precision)\n\n5. Optional: Verify the result\n   - Consider alternative methods to double-check the answer (if time allows)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we should proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have the formula for the area of a rhombus: Area = (d1 * d2) / 2\n\n2. We've been given the lengths of both diagonals:\n   - Diagonal 1 (d1) = 10 units\n   - Diagonal 2 (d2) = 24 units\n\n3. Now, we need to substitute these values into the formula:\n   Area = (10 * 24) / 2\n\n4. The next step is to perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n   10 * 24 = 240\n\n5. After that, we'll need to divide the result by 2:\n   240 / 2 = 120\n\n6. Therefore, the area of the rhombus should be 120 square units.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations to ensure accuracy. They should multiply 10 by 24, then divide the result by 2. The final answer should be expressed in square units.\n",
