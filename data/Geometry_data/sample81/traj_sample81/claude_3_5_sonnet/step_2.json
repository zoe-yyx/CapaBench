    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key properties of parallelograms:\n   - Opposite angles are congruent\n   - Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180\u00b0)\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - ABCD is a parallelogram\n   - Measure of angle A is 70\u00b0\n\n3. Apply the properties of parallelograms:\n   - Since opposite angles are congruent, angle C must also be 70\u00b0\n   - Since adjacent angles are supplementary, angle B + angle A = 180\u00b0\n\n4. Calculate the measure of angle B:\n   - Use the equation: B + 70\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   - Solve for B\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum of all angles equals 360\u00b0 (property of quadrilaterals)\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of angle B\n",
