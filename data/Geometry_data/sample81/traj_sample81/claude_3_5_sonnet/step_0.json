    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key properties of parallelograms:\n   - Opposite angles are congruent\n   - Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180\u00b0)\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - ABCD is a parallelogram\n   - Measure of angle A is 70\u00b0\n\n3. Apply the properties of parallelograms:\n   - Since opposite angles are congruent, angle C must also be 70\u00b0\n   - Since adjacent angles are supplementary, angle B + angle A = 180\u00b0\n\n4. Calculate the measure of angle B:\n   - Use the equation: B + 70\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   - Solve for B\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum of all angles equals 360\u00b0 (property of quadrilaterals)\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of angle B\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that ABCD is a parallelogram and angle A is 70\u00b0, we can use the properties of parallelograms to determine angle B. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180\u00b0. \n\nTherefore, we need to set up the equation:\n\nAngle B + Angle A = 180\u00b0\n\nWe know Angle A is 70\u00b0, so we can substitute this value:\n\nAngle B + 70\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n\nThe next logical step is to solve this equation for Angle B. We should guide the acting agent to use a calculator to perform this calculation by subtracting 70\u00b0 from both sides of the equation.\n",
