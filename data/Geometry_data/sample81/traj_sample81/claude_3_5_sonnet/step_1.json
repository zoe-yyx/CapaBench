    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key properties of parallelograms:\n   - Opposite angles are congruent\n   - Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180\u00b0)\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - ABCD is a parallelogram\n   - Measure of angle A is 70\u00b0\n\n3. Apply the properties of parallelograms:\n   - Since opposite angles are congruent, angle C must also be 70\u00b0\n   - Since adjacent angles are supplementary, angle B + angle A = 180\u00b0\n\n4. Calculate the measure of angle B:\n   - Use the equation: B + 70\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   - Solve for B\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum of all angles equals 360\u00b0 (property of quadrilaterals)\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of angle B\n",

We correctly identified that in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180\u00b0).\n2. We set up the equation: Angle B + 70\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 (where 70\u00b0 is the measure of angle A).\n3. We used a calculator to solve this equation, finding that 180\u00b0 - 70\u00b0 = 110\u00b0.\n\nThis calculation gives us the measure of angle B, which is 110\u00b0. \n\nTo ensure the completeness of our solution, we should verify this result using the properties of parallelograms:\n\n1. Opposite angles are congruent: We know angle A is 70\u00b0, so angle C should also be 70\u00b0.\n2. Adjacent angles are supplementary: We've confirmed that A + B = 70\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n3. All angles in a quadrilateral should sum to 360\u00b0: We should check if A + B + C + D = 360\u00b0.\n\nThe next logical step would be to guide the acting agent to verify these properties, particularly the last one, by adding up all the angles:\n\n70\u00b0 (A) + 110\u00b0 (B) + 70\u00b0 (C) + 110\u00b0 (D) = ?\n\nThis will confirm our solution and complete the problem-solving process.\n",
