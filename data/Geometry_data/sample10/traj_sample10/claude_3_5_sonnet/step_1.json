    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall: Remember that 45\u00b0 is a common angle in trigonometry and has special properties.\n\n2. Convert: Convert 45\u00b0 to radians if needed for calculator use (\u03c0/4 radians).\n\n3. Special Triangle: Recognize that 45\u00b0 appears in a 45-45-90 triangle, which is isosceles.\n\n4. Triangle Properties: In a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : 1 : \u221a2.\n\n5. Sine Definition: Recall that sine is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.\n\n6. Calculate: Use the properties of the 45-45-90 triangle to determine sin(45\u00b0).\n\n7. Simplify: Express the result in its simplest form, likely involving \u221a2.\n\n8. Verify: Check the result using a calculator or trigonometric table if available.\n\n9. Exact Value: Present the final answer as an exact value, not a decimal approximation.\n\n10. Reflect: Consider the significance of this value and its relation to other trigonometric functions at 45\u00b0.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the planning strategy, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. The previous action involved using a calculator to compute sin(\u03c0/4), which is equivalent to sin(45\u00b0) since 45\u00b0 = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\n2. The calculator result was 0.707106781186548, which is a decimal approximation.\n\n3. We need to connect this decimal result to our exact value reasoning from before.\n\n4. Recall that we reasoned sin(45\u00b0) should be equal to \u221a2 / 2.\n\n5. To verify this, we can square the calculator result:\n   (0.707106781186548)\u00b2 \u2248 0.5\n\n6. This is significant because (\u221a2 / 2)\u00b2 = 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\n7. The close match between the squared calculator result and our theoretical value strongly supports our reasoning.\n\n8. However, we should emphasize that \u221a2 / 2 is the exact value, while 0.707106781186548 is an approximation.\n\nThe next step should be to formally conclude that sin(45\u00b0) = \u221a2 / 2, explaining why this is the exact value and how it relates to the decimal approximation we calculated.\n",
