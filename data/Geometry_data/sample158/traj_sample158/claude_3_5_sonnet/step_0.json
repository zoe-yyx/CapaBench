    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, let's reason through the first few steps:\n\n1. We need to simplify 945\u00b0 using the periodicity of the tangent function.\n\n2. We know that tan(x) has a period of 180\u00b0, so we should divide 945\u00b0 by 180\u00b0:\n   945 \u00f7 180 = 5 remainder 45\n\n3. This means that 945\u00b0 is equivalent to 45\u00b0 in terms of its tangent value, because:\n   945\u00b0 = 5 * 180\u00b0 + 45\u00b0\n   And tan(x + 180\u00b0) = tan(x) for any angle x\n\n4. 45\u00b0 is a common angle that we often encounter in trigonometry. It's in the first quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n5. The tangent of 45\u00b0 is a well-known value. It equals 1.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning leads us to conclude that tan(945\u00b0) should be equal to tan(45\u00b0), which is 1.\n\nThe next step would be to verify this result using a calculator. The acting agent should use a scientific calculator to compute tan(945\u00b0) and confirm that it indeed equals 1.\n",
