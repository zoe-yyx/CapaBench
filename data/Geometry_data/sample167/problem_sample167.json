    "problem": "In an equilateral triangle with side length 1, what is the diameter of a circle that can be inscribed?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude divides it into two 30-60-90 right triangles. The altitude is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$, and the inradius $r$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the altitude, giving $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}s$. The diameter is twice the inradius, so the maximum diameter of the inscribed circle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}s$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$",
