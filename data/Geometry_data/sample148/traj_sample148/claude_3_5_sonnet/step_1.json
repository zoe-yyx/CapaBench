    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Imagine a 4x4 grid representing the square ABCD divided into 16 smaller squares.\n   - Consider the symmetry requirements: both horizontal and vertical lines of symmetry.\n\n2. Analyze symmetry conditions:\n   - Horizontal symmetry: The top half must mirror the bottom half.\n   - Vertical symmetry: The left half must mirror the right half.\n   - Both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.\n\n3. Identify key squares:\n   - Focus on the central 2x2 area, as it affects both horizontal and vertical symmetry.\n   - Consider the corners and edge squares and how they relate to symmetry.\n\n4. Determine minimum coloring:\n   - Start with the central 2x2 area and determine if any of these must be colored.\n   - Extend to the corners and edges, ensuring symmetry is maintained.\n   - Count the minimum number of squares that need to be colored to achieve symmetry.\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the coloring satisfies both horizontal and vertical symmetry.\n   - Confirm that no fewer squares can be colored while maintaining symmetry.\n\n6. Conclude:\n   - State the minimum number of squares that need to be colored black.\n   - Explain why this is the minimum number required for both symmetries.\n\nNote: This problem can be solved through logical reasoning without complex calculations. The acting agent may need to use a simple drawing tool or imagination to visualize the square and its symmetries.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we've visualized and verified the symmetry with the central 2x2 area colored black, we can now reason about whether this is sufficient or if more squares need to be colored.\n\n1. The central 2x2 area (4 squares) being colored black ensures both horizontal and vertical symmetry for the inner part of the square.\n\n2. However, we need to consider if this is enough for the entire 4x4 grid to have both horizontal and vertical symmetry.\n\n3. Let's analyze the outer squares:\n   - If we leave all outer squares white, the square will still have both horizontal and vertical symmetry.\n   - Coloring any outer square would require coloring its symmetric counterparts to maintain both symmetries, which would increase the total number of colored squares.\n\n4. Therefore, coloring only the central 2x2 area (4 squares) is sufficient and minimal to ensure both horizontal and vertical symmetry for the entire 4x4 grid.\n\nThe next step should be to confirm this reasoning by checking if any other configuration with fewer colored squares can achieve the same symmetry.\n",
