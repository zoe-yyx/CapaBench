Recall the formula for calculating the area of a triangle using determinants:\n   Area = (1/2) * |det[x1 y1 1; x2 y2 1; x3 y3 1]|\n\n3. Organize the coordinates into the determinant matrix:\n   | 0 0 1 |\n   | 4 0 1 |\n   | 0 3 1 |\n\n4. Calculate the determinant:\n   a. Expand along the first row\n   b. Perform necessary multiplications and subtractions\n\n5. Take the absolute value of the determinant result\n\n6. Multiply the result by 1/2 to get the final area\n\n7. Round the result if necessary and present the final answer\n\n8. Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy\n\nNote: The acting agent can use a calculator for steps 4-6 if needed.\n",
