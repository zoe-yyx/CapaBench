    "observation": "A regular octahedron has edge length 10. What is the volume of the octahedron?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the volume of a regular octahedron:\n   - Research or recall that the volume (V) of a regular octahedron is given by V = (\u221a2/3) * a\u00b3, where 'a' is the edge length.\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Edge length (a) = 10\n\n3. Prepare for calculation:\n   - Substitute the edge length into the volume formula.\n   - Simplify the expression if possible.\n\n4. Perform the calculation:\n   - Use a calculator to compute the final result.\n   - Pay attention to the order of operations and use of square root.\n\n5. Review and round the answer:\n   - Check if the result seems reasonable.\n   - Round the answer to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary.\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - State the volume with the correct units (cubic units).\n\n7. Verify the solution (optional):\n   - If time allows, consider an alternative method to check the result, such as calculating the volume of the inscribed tetrahedra.\n",

The expression we need to evaluate is:\n\nV = (\u221a2/3) * 10\u00b3\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n1. Calculate 10\u00b3 (10 cubed)\n2. Calculate \u221a2 (square root of 2)\n3. Divide \u221a2 by 3\n4. Multiply the results from steps 1 and 3\n\nThis will give us the volume of the octahedron. We should use a calculator to perform these calculations accurately, as they involve irrational numbers and large values.\n",
