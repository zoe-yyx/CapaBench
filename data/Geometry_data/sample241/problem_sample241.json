    "problem": "A regular octahedron has edge length 10. What is the volume of the octahedron?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The octahedron can be thought of as two identical square pyramids joined base to base. Using Pythagoras' Theorem in the triangle formed by the height, half the diagonal of the base, and the slant height, we get: $h^2 + (\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 = (\\frac{s\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2$. Solving this, we find $h = \\frac{s\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. The volume of one pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}\\times s^2\\times h$. Substituting the values, we find the volume of the octahedron to be $2 * \\frac{500\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ cubic units. \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1000\\sqrt{2}}{3} }\\)",
