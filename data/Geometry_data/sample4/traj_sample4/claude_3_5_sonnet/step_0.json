    "observation": "A circle with center at $O$ has a radius of 7 units. If point $A, B$ lies on the circle and $AB$ passes through point $O$, what is the length of segment $AB$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have a circle with center O and radius 7 units\n   - Points A and B lie on the circle\n   - Line segment AB passes through the center O\n\n2. Recognize the key geometric concept:\n   - When a line passes through the center of a circle and has its endpoints on the circle, it forms a diameter\n\n3. Recall the relationship between diameter and radius:\n   - Diameter is twice the length of the radius\n\n4. Calculate the length of AB:\n   - AB is a diameter, so its length will be 2 times the radius\n\n5. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Length of AB = 2 \u00d7 radius\n   - Use the calculator to multiply 2 by 7\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of segment AB in units\n\nThis plan should lead to a straightforward solution within a few steps, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the circle has a radius of 7 units and AB passes through the center O, we can conclude that AB forms a diameter of the circle. The key relationship to focus on is that the diameter of a circle is always twice the length of its radius. \n\nTherefore, to find the length of segment AB, we need to multiply the radius by 2. Since the radius is 7 units, the next logical step is to perform the calculation 2 \u00d7 7.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 2 by 7 to get the precise length of AB in units.\n",
