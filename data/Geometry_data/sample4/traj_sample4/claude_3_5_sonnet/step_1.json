    "observation": "A circle with center at $O$ has a radius of 7 units. If point $A, B$ lies on the circle and $AB$ passes through point $O$, what is the length of segment $AB$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have a circle with center O and radius 7 units\n   - Points A and B lie on the circle\n   - Line segment AB passes through the center O\n\n2. Recognize the key geometric concept:\n   - When a line passes through the center of a circle and has its endpoints on the circle, it forms a diameter\n\n3. Recall the relationship between diameter and radius:\n   - Diameter is twice the length of the radius\n\n4. Calculate the length of AB:\n   - AB is a diameter, so its length will be 2 times the radius\n\n5. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Length of AB = 2 \u00d7 radius\n   - Use the calculator to multiply 2 by 7\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of segment AB in units\n\nThis plan should lead to a straightforward solution within a few steps, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have calculated the length of segment AB to be 14 units using the calculator, we can now focus on finalizing our solution. The reasoning process has been straightforward and aligns perfectly with our initial planning strategy.\n\nThe key points to consider in our reasoning are:\n\n1. We correctly identified that AB forms a diameter of the circle since it passes through the center O.\n2. We applied the fundamental relationship that the diameter is twice the radius.\n3. We used the given radius of 7 units to calculate the diameter.\n4. The calculation 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 confirms our reasoning.\n\nAt this point, we have effectively solved the problem. The next logical step would be for the acting agent to formulate a clear and concise answer statement. This statement should include the calculated length and the units, tying back to the original question.\n\nThe acting agent should prepare to present the final answer, stating that the length of segment AB is 14 units.\n",
