Understand the given information:\n   - Initial point: (2, -1)\n   - End point: (8, 3)\n   - The line segment is extended by 4 times its original length\n\n2. Calculate the original length of the line segment:\n   - Use the distance formula between two points\n   - \u221a[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]\n\n3. Determine the direction vector of the line:\n   - Calculate the difference between end and initial points\n\n4. Find the unit vector in the direction of the line:\n   - Divide the direction vector by the original length\n\n5. Calculate the extended length:\n   - Multiply the original length by 5 (original + 4 times extension)\n\n6. Find the coordinates of the new endpoint:\n   - Start from the initial point\n   - Add the product of the extended length and the unit vector\n\n7.
