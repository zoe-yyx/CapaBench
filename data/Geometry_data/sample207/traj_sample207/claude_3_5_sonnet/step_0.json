Understand the given information:\n   - We know that cos(\u03b1) = 0.6\n   - \u03b1 is in the first quadrant (0\u00b0 < \u03b1 < 90\u00b0)\n   - We need to find tan(\u03b1)\n\n2. Recall the trigonometric identity relating tan, sin, and cos:\n   tan(\u03b1) = sin(\u03b1) / cos(\u03b1)\n\n3. Use the Pythagorean identity:\n   sin\u00b2(\u03b1) + cos\u00b2(\u03b1) = 1\n\n4. Solve for sin(\u03b1):\n   - Substitute the known value of cos(\u03b1)\n   - Isolate sin(\u03b1)\n   - Calculate the value of sin(\u03b1)\n\n5. Apply the tan(\u03b1) formula:\n   - Use the calculated sin(\u03b1) and given cos(\u03b1)\n   - Perform the division to find tan(\u03b1)\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated tan(\u03b1) is positive (as \u03b1 is in the first quadrant)\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the result\n\n7.

To solve for sin(\u03b1), we need to:\n   a) Calculate 0.6\u00b2\n   b) Subtract the result from 1\n   c) Take the square root of the difference\n\nThis reasoning suggests that our next action should be to perform these calculations to find sin(\u03b1).
