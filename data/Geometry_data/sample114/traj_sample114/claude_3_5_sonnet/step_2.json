    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components:\n   - Triangle ABC with given coordinates\n   - Focus on side BC\n   - Need to find the perpendicular bisector of BC\n\n2. Calculate the midpoint of BC:\n   - Use the midpoint formula: ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n\n3. Find the slope of BC:\n   - Use the slope formula: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\n4. Determine the slope of the perpendicular bisector:\n   - The perpendicular slope is the negative reciprocal of BC's slope\n\n5. Verify the perpendicular bisector:\n   - It should pass through the midpoint of BC\n   - Its slope should be perpendicular to BC's slope\n\n6. Form the equation of the perpendicular bisector:\n   - Use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   - Use the midpoint as (x1, y1) and the calculated perpendicular slope as m\n\n7. Simplify and present the final answer:\n   - The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the coefficient of x in the equation\n\n8. Double-check the result:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Verify that the slope satisfies the perpendicular condition\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated two important pieces of information:\n\n1. The midpoint of BC: (2.5, -0.5)\n2. The slope of BC: 3.66666666666667\n\nNow, we need to determine the slope of the perpendicular bisector. We know that the slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of BC's slope. \n\nTo find the negative reciprocal:\n1. Take the reciprocal of 3.66666666666667 (which means 1 divided by this number)\n2. Then make it negative\n\nSo, our next step should be to calculate:\n-1 / 3.66666666666667\n\nThis will give us the slope of the perpendicular bisector, which is the final answer we're looking for in this problem.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have completed all the necessary steps to solve the problem. We can then verify our answer by checking if it satisfies the perpendicular condition (the product of the two slopes should be -1).\n",
