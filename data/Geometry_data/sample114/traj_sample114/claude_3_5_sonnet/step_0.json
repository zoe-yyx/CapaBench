Calculate the midpoint of BC:\n   - Use the midpoint formula: ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n\n3. Find the slope of BC:\n   - Use the slope formula: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\n4. Determine the slope of the perpendicular bisector:\n   - The perpendicular slope is the negative reciprocal of BC's slope\n\n5. Verify the perpendicular bisector:\n   - It should pass through the midpoint of BC\n   - Its slope should be perpendicular to BC's slope\n\n6. Form the equation of the perpendicular bisector:\n   - Use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   - Use the midpoint as (x1, y1) and the calculated perpendicular slope as m\n\n7. Simplify and present the final answer:\n   - The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the coefficient of x in the equation\n\n8.
