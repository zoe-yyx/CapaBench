    "observation": "Isosceles trapezoid $WXYZ$ has bases $WX = 10$ and $YZ = 6$. What is the average length of the bases?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have an isosceles trapezoid WXYZ\n   - The longer base WX = 10\n   - The shorter base YZ = 6\n\n2. Recall the definition of average:\n   - Average = Sum of values / Number of values\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - Calculate the average length of the two bases\n\n4. Plan the solution:\n   a. Add the lengths of the two bases\n   b. Divide the sum by 2 (since there are two bases)\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if needed for precise results\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result is between the lengths of the two bases\n   - Ensure the answer is expressed as a single number\n\n7. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have successfully calculated the average length of the bases, which is 8, we now have the final answer to our problem. The next logical step is to verify this result and present it as the solution.\n\nTo verify:\n1. We can confirm that 8 is indeed between the lengths of the two bases (6 and 10).\n2. We can also check that 8 is exactly halfway between 6 and 10, which makes sense for an average.\n\nThe reasoning process is complete, and we have arrived at a verified solution. The acting agent should now present 8 as the final answer to the problem: \"The average length of the bases in the isosceles trapezoid WXYZ is 8.\"\n\nNo further calculations or searches are needed at this point. The problem has been solved correctly and efficiently.\n",
