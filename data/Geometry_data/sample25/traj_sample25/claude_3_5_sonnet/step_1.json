    "observation": "Isosceles trapezoid $WXYZ$ has bases $WX = 10$ and $YZ = 6$. What is the average length of the bases?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have an isosceles trapezoid WXYZ\n   - The longer base WX = 10\n   - The shorter base YZ = 6\n\n2. Recall the definition of average:\n   - Average = Sum of values / Number of values\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - Calculate the average length of the two bases\n\n4. Plan the solution:\n   a. Add the lengths of the two bases\n   b. Divide the sum by 2 (since there are two bases)\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if needed for precise results\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result is between the lengths of the two bases\n   - Ensure the answer is expressed as a single number\n\n7. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the sum of the two bases (10 + 6 = 16), we can proceed to the final step of calculating the average. To find the average, we need to divide this sum by the number of bases, which is 2.\n\nThe next logical operation is to divide 16 by 2. This will give us the average length of the bases, which is our goal.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to perform the division of 16 by 2. This calculation will provide us with the final answer to the problem - the average length of the bases in the isosceles trapezoid WXYZ.\n\nAfter this calculation, we should have our final answer, which we can then verify by checking if it falls between the lengths of the two given bases (6 and 10) as a quick sanity check.\n",
