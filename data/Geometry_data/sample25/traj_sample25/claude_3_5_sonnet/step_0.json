    "observation": "Isosceles trapezoid $WXYZ$ has bases $WX = 10$ and $YZ = 6$. What is the average length of the bases?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have an isosceles trapezoid WXYZ\n   - The longer base WX = 10\n   - The shorter base YZ = 6\n\n2. Recall the definition of average:\n   - Average = Sum of values / Number of values\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - Calculate the average length of the two bases\n\n4. Plan the solution:\n   a. Add the lengths of the two bases\n   b. Divide the sum by 2 (since there are two bases)\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if needed for precise results\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result is between the lengths of the two bases\n   - Ensure the answer is expressed as a single number\n\n7. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo find the average length of the bases in the isosceles trapezoid WXYZ, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. We know that WX = 10 (longer base) and YZ = 6 (shorter base).\n\n2. To calculate the average, we need to add these two values and then divide by the number of values (which is 2 in this case).\n\n3. The next logical step is to add the lengths of the two bases:\n   10 + 6\n\n4. After this addition, we'll need to divide the result by 2.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to perform the addition of 10 and 6 as the next operation. This will give us the sum of the base lengths, which is a crucial step in calculating the average.\n",
