    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the slope formula:\n   Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n   where (x1, y1) and (x2, x2) are two points on the line\n\n2. Identify the given points:\n   Point 1: (2, -1)\n   Point 2: (5, 2)\n\n3. Assign values to the variables:\n   x1 = 2, y1 = -1\n   x2 = 5, y2 = 2\n\n4. Substitute these values into the slope formula:\n   m = (2 - (-1)) / (5 - 2)\n\n5. Simplify the numerator:\n   m = (2 + 1) / (5 - 2)\n   m = 3 / (5 - 2)\n\n6. Simplify the denominator:\n   m = 3 / 3\n\n7. Perform the final division:\n   m = 1\n\n8. Verify the result by checking if it makes sense \n   (positive slope as the line goes up from left to right)\n\n9. Present the final answer: The slope of the line is 1\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that no actions have been taken yet, we should start by implementing the slope formula. The slope formula is a fundamental concept in this problem, and it's the first step in our plan.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nWe have two points:\n(x1, y1) = (2, -1)\n(x2, y2) = (5, 2)\n\nWe should substitute these values into the formula:\n\nm = (2 - (-1)) / (5 - 2)\n\nThis step involves subtracting the y-coordinates and x-coordinates separately. The subtraction in the numerator involves a negative number, which may require careful attention.\n\nThe next logical step would be to simplify this expression. The acting agent should focus on simplifying the numerator first, then the denominator, and finally perform the division.\n",
