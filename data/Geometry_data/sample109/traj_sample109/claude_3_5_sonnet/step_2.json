Simplify the angle:\n   - Reduce 480\u00b0 to an equivalent angle within the range of 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.\n   - 480\u00b0 \u00f7 360\u00b0 = 1 remainder 120\u00b0\n   - Therefore, cos 480\u00b0 = cos 120\u00b0\n\n3. Identify special angle:\n   - Recognize that 120\u00b0 is a special angle in the unit circle.\n\n4. Recall the cosine value for 120\u00b0:\n   - If not immediately known, use the unit circle or trigonometric identities to derive it.\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the exact value of cos 120\u00b0.\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Use a calculator to check if the exact value matches the decimal approximation of cos 480\u00b0.\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 10 rounds, as it mainly involves angle reduction and recalling a standard cosine value.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, we have successfully simplified the problem. Let's analyze our findings:\n\n1. We've determined that 480\u00b0 is equivalent to one full rotation (360\u00b0) plus an additional 120\u00b0.\n2. Therefore, cos(480\u00b0) = cos(120\u00b0)\n\nThis simplification is crucial because 120\u00b0 is a special angle in the unit circle, which makes our problem much more manageable. \n\nNow, we need to recall or derive the cosine value for 120\u00b0. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Recognize that 120\u00b0 is in the second quadrant of the unit circle.\n2. Recall that 120\u00b0 is complementary to 60\u00b0, which is a commonly known angle.\n3. The cosine of 120\u00b0 is the negative of the cosine of its complementary angle (60\u00b0).\n\nGiven this information, our next step should be to:\n\n1. Recall the cosine value of 60\u00b0, which is a standard angle.\n2. Apply the negative to this value to get cos(120\u00b0).\n\nThe acting agent should use their knowledge base or a reliable mathematical reference to confirm the cosine value of 60\u00b0, and then apply the appropriate sign change to determine cos(120\u00b0).\n",
