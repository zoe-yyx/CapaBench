Simplify the angle:\n   - Reduce 480\u00b0 to an equivalent angle within the range of 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.\n   - 480\u00b0 \u00f7 360\u00b0 = 1 remainder 120\u00b0\n   - Therefore, cos 480\u00b0 = cos 120\u00b0\n\n3. Identify special angle:\n   - Recognize that 120\u00b0 is a special angle in the unit circle.\n\n4. Recall the cosine value for 120\u00b0:\n   - If not immediately known, use the unit circle or trigonometric identities to derive it.\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the exact value of cos 120\u00b0.\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Use a calculator to check if the exact value matches the decimal approximation of cos 480\u00b0.\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 10 rounds, as it mainly involves angle reduction and recalling a standard cosine value.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe first step in solving this problem is to simplify the angle using the periodicity of the cosine function. We know that cosine repeats every 360\u00b0, so we can reduce 480\u00b0 to an equivalent angle within the range of 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.\n\nTo do this, we need to divide 480\u00b0 by 360\u00b0 and focus on the remainder. This operation will give us the equivalent angle within the first revolution of the unit circle.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to perform the division 480 \u00f7 360 and determine the remainder. This will allow us to simplify our problem from cos(480\u00b0) to an equivalent expression with a smaller angle.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division and report back the quotient and remainder.\n",
