Simplify the angle:\n   - Reduce 480\u00b0 to an equivalent angle within the range of 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0.\n   - 480\u00b0 \u00f7 360\u00b0 = 1 remainder 120\u00b0\n   - Therefore, cos 480\u00b0 = cos 120\u00b0\n\n3. Identify special angle:\n   - Recognize that 120\u00b0 is a special angle in the unit circle.\n\n4. Recall the cosine value for 120\u00b0:\n   - If not immediately known, use the unit circle or trigonometric identities to derive it.\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the exact value of cos 120\u00b0.\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Use a calculator to check if the exact value matches the decimal approximation of cos 480\u00b0.\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 10 rounds, as it mainly involves angle reduction and recalling a standard cosine value.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the information provided. Based on the planning strategy and the historical action, we've made good progress. Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1. We've confirmed that 480\u00b0 divided by 360\u00b0 is 1.33333333333333.\n2. This decimal result indicates that 480\u00b0 is equivalent to one full rotation (360\u00b0) plus some additional degrees.\n\nNow, we need to focus on the remainder, which represents the equivalent angle within the range of 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0. To find this, we should:\n\n1. Multiply the whole number part of the division result (1) by 360\u00b0.\n2. Subtract this from 480\u00b0 to get the remainder.\n\nThis will give us the simplified angle that is equivalent to 480\u00b0 in terms of its cosine value.\n\nThe next logical step is to perform these calculations to determine the exact remainder. This will allow us to express cos(480\u00b0) as cos(remainder\u00b0), where the remainder is between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to:\n1. Multiply 1 by 360\n2. Subtract the result from 480\n\nThis will give us the simplified angle we're looking for.\n",
