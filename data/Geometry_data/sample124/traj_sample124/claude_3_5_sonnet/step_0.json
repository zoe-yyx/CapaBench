    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Draw an equilateral triangle with side length 12 units\n   - Draw a line segment parallel to one side, touching the midpoints of the other two sides\n\n2. Recall key properties of equilateral triangles:\n   - All angles are 60 degrees\n   - The height (altitude) bisects the base and creates two 30-60-90 triangles\n\n3. Identify the relationship between the given line segment and the triangle:\n   - The line segment creates a smaller triangle similar to the original triangle\n\n4. Use the properties of similar triangles:\n   - The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is constant\n\n5. Calculate the height of the original triangle:\n   - Use the 30-60-90 triangle relationships\n   - Height = side length \u00d7 (\u221a3 / 2)\n\n6. Determine the ratio of the smaller triangle to the larger triangle:\n   - The line segment cuts the height of the triangle in half\n\n7. Apply the ratio to find the length of the line segment:\n   - Line segment length = original side length \u00d7 ratio\n\n8. Perform the final calculation to get the answer\n\n9. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\n10. Present the final answer with appropriate units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we should focus on understanding the geometry of the equilateral triangle and the line segment. Let's start by calculating the height of the equilateral triangle, as this will be crucial for determining the ratio of the smaller triangle to the larger one.\n\nWe know that an equilateral triangle with side length 12 units can be divided into two 30-60-90 triangles by its altitude. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the shorter leg (half the side of the equilateral triangle) to the height is 1:\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the height of the equilateral triangle using the formula:\n\nHeight = (side length \u00d7 \u221a3) / 2\n\nWe need to calculate this value to proceed. The acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n\n(12 \u00d7 \u221a3) / 2\n\nThis will give us the height of the original equilateral triangle, which is a crucial piece of information for the next steps in our solution.\n",
