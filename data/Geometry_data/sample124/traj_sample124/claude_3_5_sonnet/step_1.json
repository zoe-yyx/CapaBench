    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Draw an equilateral triangle with side length 12 units\n   - Draw a line segment parallel to one side, touching the midpoints of the other two sides\n\n2. Recall key properties of equilateral triangles:\n   - All angles are 60 degrees\n   - The height (altitude) bisects the base and creates two 30-60-90 triangles\n\n3. Identify the relationship between the given line segment and the triangle:\n   - The line segment creates a smaller triangle similar to the original triangle\n\n4. Use the properties of similar triangles:\n   - The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is constant\n\n5. Calculate the height of the original triangle:\n   - Use the 30-60-90 triangle relationships\n   - Height = side length \u00d7 (\u221a3 / 2)\n\n6. Determine the ratio of the smaller triangle to the larger triangle:\n   - The line segment cuts the height of the triangle in half\n\n7. Apply the ratio to find the length of the line segment:\n   - Line segment length = original side length \u00d7 ratio\n\n8. Perform the final calculation to get the answer\n\n9. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\n10. Present the final answer with appropriate units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for providing the calculation result. Now that we have the height of the equilateral triangle (approximately 10.39 units), we can proceed with our reasoning.\n\nGiven:\n- The original triangle is equilateral with side length 12 units.\n- The height of the triangle is approximately 10.39 units.\n- The line segment we're looking for is parallel to one side and touches the midpoints of the other two sides.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The line segment creates a smaller triangle that is similar to the original triangle.\n2. The height of this smaller triangle is exactly half of the original triangle's height (because it touches the midpoints of the sides).\n3. In similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant.\n4. The ratio of the heights of the small triangle to the large triangle is 1:2.\n5. This same ratio will apply to the side lengths of the triangles.\n\nTherefore, to find the length of the line segment, we need to multiply the original side length by the ratio:\n\nLine segment length = Original side length \u00d7 (1/2)\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n\n12 \u00d7 (1/2) or simply 12 \u00f7 2\n\nThis calculation will give us the length of the line segment we're looking for.\n",
