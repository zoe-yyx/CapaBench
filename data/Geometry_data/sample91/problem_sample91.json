    "problem": "A right circular cone has a height of 9 cm and a base radius of 3 cm. Calculate the volume of the cone.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume $V$ of a right circular cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. Plugging in the values, we get $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3)^2 (9) = 27\\pi$. Hence, the volume of the cone is $\\boxed{27\\pi}$ cubic cm.",
