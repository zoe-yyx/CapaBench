    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the volume of a cone:\n   V = (1/3) * \u03c0 * r^2 * h\n   where V is volume, r is base radius, and h is height\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Height (h) = 9 cm\n   - Base radius (r) = 3 cm\n\n3. Substitute the known values into the formula:\n   V = (1/3) * \u03c0 * (3 cm)^2 * 9 cm\n\n4. Calculate step by step:\n   a) Calculate r^2: 3^2 = 9\n   b) Multiply \u03c0 * r^2: \u03c0 * 9\n   c) Multiply the result by h: (\u03c0 * 9) * 9\n   d) Multiply the entire expression by 1/3\n\n5. Use a calculator to compute the final result:\n   - Multiply 9 * 9 * \u03c0\n   - Divide the result by 3\n\n6. Round the answer to two decimal places if necessary\n\n7. Present the final answer with the appropriate unit (cm\u00b3)\n\n8. Double-check the calculation and units for accuracy\n",
