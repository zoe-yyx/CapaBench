Recall the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n   Area = length \u00d7 width\n\n3. Determine the length of the rectangle:\n   - Calculate the distance between points A and D (or B and C)\n   - Use the distance formula between two points on a coordinate plane\n\n4. Determine the width of the rectangle:\n   - Calculate the distance between points A and B (or D and C)\n   - Use the distance formula between two points on a coordinate plane\n\n5. Apply the area formula:\n   - Multiply the calculated length by the calculated width\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated area makes sense given the coordinates\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nTo find the area of rectangle ABCD, we need to calculate its length and width. Given the coordinates of the vertices, we can determine these dimensions without using the distance formula, as the rectangle is aligned with the coordinate axes.\n\n1. For the length:\n   - We can use the x-coordinates of points A and C (or B and D).\n   - The length is the difference between these x-coordinates.\n\n2. For the width:\n   - We can use the y-coordinates of points A and B (or C and D).\n   - The width is the difference between these y-coordinates.\n\n3. Once we have the length and width, we can multiply them to get the area.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the length by subtracting the x-coordinate of A from the x-coordinate of C.\n2. Calculate the width by subtracting the y-coordinate of A from the y-coordinate of B.\n3. Multiply the length by the width to get the area.\n\nThis approach simplifies the calculation and avoids the need for the distance formula or square roots, making it easier and more efficient to solve the problem.\n",
