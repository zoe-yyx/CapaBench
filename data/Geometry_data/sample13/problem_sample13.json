    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "To find the area of the rectangle, calculate the length of sides $AB$ and $AD$. The length of $AB$, which is vertical, is $8 - 3 = 5$ units, and the length of $AD$, which is horizontal, is $6 - 1 = 5$ units. The area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $5 \\times 5 = \\boxed{25}$ square units.",
