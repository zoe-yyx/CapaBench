    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a decagon (10-sided polygon)\n   - It's divided into 10 triangles from one vertex\n   - The circumference is 40 units\n   - We need to find the area of the farthest triangle\n\n2. Calculate the side length of the decagon:\n   - Circumference = 40 units\n   - Number of sides = 10\n   - Side length = Circumference / Number of sides\n\n3. Determine the central angle of the decagon:\n   - Central angle = 360\u00b0 / Number of sides\n\n4. Identify the farthest triangle:\n   - The farthest triangle will be an isosceles triangle\n   - It will have two sides equal to the decagon's side length\n   - The third side will be a diagonal of the decagon\n\n5. Calculate the length of the diagonal:\n   - Use the law of cosines to find the diagonal length\n   - Diagonal^2 = 2 * (side length)^2 - 2 * (side length)^2 * cos(4 * central angle)\n\n6. Calculate the area of the farthest triangle:\n   - Use Heron's formula to find the area\n   - s = (a + b + c) / 2 (semi-perimeter)\n   - Area = \u221a(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))\n\n7. Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n8. Verify the answer and ensure all steps are correct\n\n9. Present the final answer in decimal form, rounded to 2 decimal places\n",

Calculate s-a, s-b, and s-c\n   a = b = 4 (sides of the decagon)\n   c = 7.60845213036123 (diagonal)\n   \n2. Multiply s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c)\n\n3. Take the square root of the result\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate:\ns-a = 7.80422606518061 - 4\ns-b = 7.80422606518061 - 4\ns-c = 7.80422606518061 - 7.60845213036123\n\nThen, we'll multiply these values together with s:\ns * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c)\n\nFinally, we'll take the square root of this result to get the area of the triangle.\n\nLet's start by calculating s-a, s-b, and s-c.\n",
