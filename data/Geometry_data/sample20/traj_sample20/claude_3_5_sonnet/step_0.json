    "observation": "A square has a side length of 5 cm. What is the greatest possible length of a diagonal in this square? Give the answer in decimal and round to 2 decimal places",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the diagonal of a square:\n   - The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n2. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a square, the diagonal forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\n   - The other two sides of this triangle are the sides of the square.\n\n3. Set up the equation:\n   - Use the formula: diagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2\n\n4. Plug in the known value:\n   - Side length is 5 cm, so substitute this into the equation.\n\n5. Solve for the diagonal:\n   - Simplify the equation.\n   - Take the square root of both sides.\n\n6. Use a calculator:\n   - Calculate the square root to get the exact value.\n\n7. Round the result:\n   - Round the answer to 2 decimal places as requested.\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the diagonal length in centimeters, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\n9. Optional: Verify the result:\n   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the answer makes sense.\n\n10. Conclude:\n    - Summarize the problem-solving process and state the final answer clearly.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal of the square. The planning strategy outlines the steps clearly, so let's start with setting up the equation.\n\nWe know that in a square, the diagonal forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle where the other two sides are the sides of the square. The Pythagorean theorem states that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse (diagonal in our case) and a and b are the sides of the square.\n\nGiven:\n- The side length of the square is 5 cm.\n\nLet's set up the equation:\ndiagonal\u00b2 = side\u00b2 + side\u00b2\ndiagonal\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2\n\nThe next step is to simplify this equation and solve for the diagonal. We should guide the acting agent to use a calculator to perform these calculations:\n\n1. Calculate 5\u00b2 (5 squared)\n2. Add the result to itself (since we have 5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2)\n3. Take the square root of this sum\n4. Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\nThis will give us the length of the diagonal in centimeters, rounded to 2 decimal places as requested in the problem.\n",
