Simplify the angle:\n   - Express 240\u00b0 in terms of a more familiar angle in the standard unit circle\n   - 240\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0\n\n3. Apply the tangent angle addition formula:\n   - Use tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)\n   - In this case, A = 180\u00b0 and B = 60\u00b0\n\n4. Evaluate tan 180\u00b0:\n   - Recall that tan 180\u00b0 = 0\n\n5. Evaluate tan 60\u00b0:\n   - Recall the special angle value for tan 60\u00b0, or\n   - Use the calculator to compute tan 60\u00b0 if needed\n\n6. Substitute values into the tangent addition formula:\n   - tan 240\u00b0 = tan(180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = (tan 180\u00b0 + tan 60\u00b0) / (1 - tan 180\u00b0 * tan 60\u00b0)\n\n7. Simplify the expression:\n   - Use the values obtained in steps 4 and 5\n\n8. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if necessary to compute the final result\n\n9. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense given the location of 240\u00b0 in the unit circle\n   - Confirm that the result matches the sign and magnitude expected for this angle\n\n10. Express the final answer:\n    - Present the computed value of tan 240\u00b0 in its simplest form\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving for tan 240\u00b0, we should first simplify the angle using our knowledge of the unit circle and trigonometric functions. Let's break this down:\n\n1. Recall that tan is periodic with a period of 360\u00b0. This means we can work with angles within one full rotation.\n\n2. 240\u00b0 can be expressed as 180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0. This is helpful because:\n   - 180\u00b0 is a known angle where tan 180\u00b0 = 0\n   - 60\u00b0 is a special angle in the unit circle with a known tan value\n\n3. We can use the tangent addition formula: tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)\n\n4. In this case, A = 180\u00b0 and B = 60\u00b0\n\n5. We know that tan 180\u00b0 = 0, but we need to confirm the value of tan 60\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to determine the exact value of tan 60\u00b0. The acting agent should either recall this value if it's known, or use a calculator to compute it precisely.\n",
