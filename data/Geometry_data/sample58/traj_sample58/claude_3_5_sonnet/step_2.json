Simplify the angle:\n   - Express 240\u00b0 in terms of a more familiar angle in the standard unit circle\n   - 240\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0\n\n3. Apply the tangent angle addition formula:\n   - Use tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)\n   - In this case, A = 180\u00b0 and B = 60\u00b0\n\n4. Evaluate tan 180\u00b0:\n   - Recall that tan 180\u00b0 = 0\n\n5. Evaluate tan 60\u00b0:\n   - Recall the special angle value for tan 60\u00b0, or\n   - Use the calculator to compute tan 60\u00b0 if needed\n\n6. Substitute values into the tangent addition formula:\n   - tan 240\u00b0 = tan(180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = (tan 180\u00b0 + tan 60\u00b0) / (1 - tan 180\u00b0 * tan 60\u00b0)\n\n7. Simplify the expression:\n   - Use the values obtained in steps 4 and 5\n\n8. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if necessary to compute the final result\n\n9. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense given the location of 240\u00b0 in the unit circle\n   - Confirm that the result matches the sign and magnitude expected for this angle\n\n10. Express the final answer:\n    - Present the computed value of tan 240\u00b0 in its simplest form\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the calculated results, we can now focus on expressing our final answer in its simplest and most precise form. Here's our reasoning:\n\n1. We have calculated that tan 240\u00b0 \u2248 1.73205080756888.\n\n2. This decimal representation is very close to \u221a3, which is a well-known mathematical constant.\n\n3. In fact, tan 60\u00b0 is exactly \u221a3, and we've shown that tan 240\u00b0 = tan 60\u00b0.\n\n4. The slight difference in our calculated value (1.73205080756888) from the exact \u221a3 is due to the limitations of decimal representation in calculators and computers.\n\n5. In mathematical proofs and expressions, it's generally preferred to use exact values when possible, especially when dealing with well-known constants.\n\n6. Therefore, we should express our final answer as \u221a3 rather than the decimal approximation.\n\n7. This also aligns with step 10 of our planning strategy, which states we should \"Present the computed value of tan 240\u00b0 in its simplest form.\"\n\nGiven this reasoning, the next logical step for the acting agent would be to confirm that 1.73205080756888 is indeed \u221a3, and then express the final answer as tan 240\u00b0 = \u221a3. This can be done by squaring the decimal value we obtained and comparing it to 3, or by looking up the exact value of tan 240\u00b0 in a mathematical reference.\n",
