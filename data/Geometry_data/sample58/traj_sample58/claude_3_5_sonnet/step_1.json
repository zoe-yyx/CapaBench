Simplify the angle:\n   - Express 240\u00b0 in terms of a more familiar angle in the standard unit circle\n   - 240\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0\n\n3. Apply the tangent angle addition formula:\n   - Use tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)\n   - In this case, A = 180\u00b0 and B = 60\u00b0\n\n4. Evaluate tan 180\u00b0:\n   - Recall that tan 180\u00b0 = 0\n\n5. Evaluate tan 60\u00b0:\n   - Recall the special angle value for tan 60\u00b0, or\n   - Use the calculator to compute tan 60\u00b0 if needed\n\n6. Substitute values into the tangent addition formula:\n   - tan 240\u00b0 = tan(180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = (tan 180\u00b0 + tan 60\u00b0) / (1 - tan 180\u00b0 * tan 60\u00b0)\n\n7. Simplify the expression:\n   - Use the values obtained in steps 4 and 5\n\n8. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if necessary to compute the final result\n\n9. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense given the location of 240\u00b0 in the unit circle\n   - Confirm that the result matches the sign and magnitude expected for this angle\n\n10. Express the final answer:\n    - Present the computed value of tan 240\u00b0 in its simplest form\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the calculated value of tan(\u03c0/3), we can now proceed with our reasoning:\n\n1. We have confirmed that tan 60\u00b0 \u2248 1.73205080756888 (which is \u221a3)\n2. We already know that tan 180\u00b0 = 0\n3. We can now apply the tangent addition formula:\n\n   tan 240\u00b0 = tan(180\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = (tan 180\u00b0 + tan 60\u00b0) / (1 - tan 180\u00b0 * tan 60\u00b0)\n\n4. Let's substitute the known values:\n   \n   tan 240\u00b0 = (0 + 1.73205080756888) / (1 - 0 * 1.73205080756888)\n\n5. Simplify:\n   \n   tan 240\u00b0 = 1.73205080756888 / 1 = 1.73205080756888\n\n6. This result makes sense because:\n   - 240\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle\n   - In the third quadrant, tangent is positive\n   - The magnitude is the same as tan 60\u00b0 (or tan 300\u00b0) due to the periodicity and odd function properties of tangent\n\nThe next logical step is to confirm this calculation and express the result in its simplest form, which is \u221a3.\n",
