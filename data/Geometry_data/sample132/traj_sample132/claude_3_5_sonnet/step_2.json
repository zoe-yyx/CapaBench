    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the diagonal of a square:\n   - The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.\n   - The formula is: diagonal = \u221a(side^2 + side^2) = \u221a(2 * side^2)\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Side length of the square = 14 units\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute the side length into the diagonal formula\n   - Calculate diagonal = \u221a(2 * 14^2)\n\n4. Simplify the expression under the square root:\n   - Calculate 14^2 = 196\n   - Calculate 2 * 196 = 392\n\n5. Calculate the square root:\n   - Find \u221a392 (this may require a calculator for precision)\n\n6. Round the result if necessary and present the final answer:\n   - Express the diagonal length in units\n   - Round to an appropriate number of decimal places if needed\n\n7. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense (it should be longer than the side length but less than twice the side length)\n   - Optionally, use the Pythagorean theorem to confirm the calculation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection information and the original problem, we need to revise our approach to provide the exact mathematical answer rather than a decimal approximation. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Recall that we correctly applied the formula for the diagonal of a square: diagonal = \u221a(2 * side^2)\n\n2. Given that the side length is 14 units, we can express the diagonal as:\n   diagonal = \u221a(2 * 14^2) = \u221a(2 * 196) = \u221a392\n\n3. Now, instead of calculating this square root, we should simplify it further:\n   \u221a392 = \u221a(196 * 2) = \u221a196 * \u221a2 = 14\u221a2\n\n4. Therefore, the exact length of the diagonal is 14\u221a2 units.\n\n5. We should verify that this answer makes sense:\n   - It's in the form of a side length (14) multiplied by \u221a2, which is correct for a square's diagonal\n   - \u221a2 is approximately 1.414, so 14\u221a2 is indeed greater than 14 but less than 28 (twice the side length)\n\nThe acting agent should now express the final answer as 14\u221a2 units, which is the exact and mathematically precise solution to this problem.\n",
