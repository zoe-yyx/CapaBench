    "observation": "A square has a side length of 14 units. What is the length of the diagonal of the square?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the diagonal of a square:\n   - The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.\n   - The formula is: diagonal = \u221a(side^2 + side^2) = \u221a(2 * side^2)\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Side length of the square = 14 units\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute the side length into the diagonal formula\n   - Calculate diagonal = \u221a(2 * 14^2)\n\n4. Simplify the expression under the square root:\n   - Calculate 14^2 = 196\n   - Calculate 2 * 196 = 392\n\n5. Calculate the square root:\n   - Find \u221a392 (this may require a calculator for precision)\n\n6. Round the result if necessary and present the final answer:\n   - Express the diagonal length in units\n   - Round to an appropriate number of decimal places if needed\n\n7. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense (it should be longer than the side length but less than twice the side length)\n   - Optionally, use the Pythagorean theorem to confirm the calculation\n",
