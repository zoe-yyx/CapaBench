    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the formula $d = s\\sqrt{2}$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. Substituting the given side length, $d = 14\\sqrt{2}$. Hence, the diagonal length is $\\boxed{14\\sqrt{2}}$ units.",
