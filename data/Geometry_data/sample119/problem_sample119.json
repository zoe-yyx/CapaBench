    "solution": "The area of a triangle is maximized when it is isosceles. Given one side is 5 units, and the sum of the other two sides is 10, the other two sides must each be 5 units to maximize the area. This forms an equilateral triangle with all sides 5. The area A of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by A = (s^2 * sqrt(3))/4. Substituting s = 5, the area is (25 * sqrt(3))/4 = \\boxed{10.83} square units.",
