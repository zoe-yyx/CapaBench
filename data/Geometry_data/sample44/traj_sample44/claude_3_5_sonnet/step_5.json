    "observation": "If a sphere has a radius of 5 cm, what is its surface area?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving Sphere Surface Area Problem:\n\n1. Recall the formula:\n   - Remember the formula for the surface area of a sphere: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n   where A is the surface area and r is the radius.\n\n2. Identify given information:\n   - Radius (r) = 5 cm\n\n3. Prepare for calculation:\n   - Substitute r = 5 into the formula\n   - Equation will be: A = 4\u03c0(5\u00b2)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate 5\u00b2 (5 squared)\n   - Multiply the result by 4\u03c0\n   - Use 3.14159 as an approximation for \u03c0 if needed\n\n5. Final answer:\n   - Express the result in square centimeters (cm\u00b2)\n   - Round to two decimal places if necessary\n\n6. Verify:\n   - Check if the answer seems reasonable (should be larger than the area of a circle with radius 5 cm)\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and our previous steps, we now understand that maintaining mathematical precision by using the symbolic form of \u03c0 is crucial for this problem. Let's adjust our approach:\n\n1. We need to revisit our original formula: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n2. We should substitute r = 5 into this formula without using a decimal approximation for \u03c0\n3. We need to simplify the expression algebraically, keeping \u03c0 in its symbolic form\n\nOur reasoning for the next step should be:\n\nCalculate 4\u03c0(5\u00b2) algebraically:\n- First, compute 5\u00b2 = 25\n- Then, multiply this by 4\u03c0\n- The result should be in the form of a coefficient multiplied by \u03c0\n\nThis approach will give us the exact surface area expressed in terms of \u03c0, which is the most precise way to represent the answer in this context. It avoids any loss of precision that comes from using decimal approximations of \u03c0.\n\nThe acting agent should perform this algebraic calculation and express the final answer as a numerical coefficient multiplied by \u03c0, without any units or additional formatting.\n",
