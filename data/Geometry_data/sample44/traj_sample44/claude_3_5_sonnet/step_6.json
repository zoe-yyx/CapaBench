    "observation": "If a sphere has a radius of 5 cm, what is its surface area?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving Sphere Surface Area Problem:\n\n1. Recall the formula:\n   - Remember the formula for the surface area of a sphere: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n   where A is the surface area and r is the radius.\n\n2. Identify given information:\n   - Radius (r) = 5 cm\n\n3. Prepare for calculation:\n   - Substitute r = 5 into the formula\n   - Equation will be: A = 4\u03c0(5\u00b2)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate 5\u00b2 (5 squared)\n   - Multiply the result by 4\u03c0\n   - Use 3.14159 as an approximation for \u03c0 if needed\n\n5. Final answer:\n   - Express the result in square centimeters (cm\u00b2)\n   - Round to two decimal places if necessary\n\n6. Verify:\n   - Check if the answer seems reasonable (should be larger than the area of a circle with radius 5 cm)\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the most recent calculation, we have made significant progress in solving the problem. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We have correctly applied the formula for the surface area of a sphere: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n2. We have used the given radius of 5 cm in our calculation.\n3. We have used the symbolic form of \u03c0 in our latest calculation.\n4. The calculator has provided us with a result of 314.159265358979, which is a more precise value.\n\nNow, we need to focus on expressing this result in the most mathematically precise form:\n\n1. The current result is very precise, but it's still an approximation due to the limitations of decimal representation of \u03c0.\n2. To maintain maximum precision, we should express the answer in terms of \u03c0.\n3. We need to simplify our original expression 4\u03c0(5\u00b2) to its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step would be to simplify 4\u03c0(5\u00b2) algebraically:\n\n1. Calculate 5\u00b2 = 25\n2. Multiply this by 4\n3. Express the final result as a coefficient multiplied by \u03c0\n\nThis approach will give us the exact surface area in its most precise mathematical form, avoiding any loss of accuracy that comes from using decimal approximations of \u03c0.\n\nThe acting agent should perform this algebraic simplification and express the final answer as a numerical coefficient multiplied by \u03c0, without any units or additional formatting.\n",
