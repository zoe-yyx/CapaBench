    "observation": "If a sphere has a radius of 5 cm, what is its surface area?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving Sphere Surface Area Problem:\n\n1. Recall the formula:\n   - Remember the formula for the surface area of a sphere: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n   where A is the surface area and r is the radius.\n\n2. Identify given information:\n   - Radius (r) = 5 cm\n\n3. Prepare for calculation:\n   - Substitute r = 5 into the formula\n   - Equation will be: A = 4\u03c0(5\u00b2)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate 5\u00b2 (5 squared)\n   - Multiply the result by 4\u03c0\n   - Use 3.14159 as an approximation for \u03c0 if needed\n\n5. Final answer:\n   - Express the result in square centimeters (cm\u00b2)\n   - Round to two decimal places if necessary\n\n6. Verify:\n   - Check if the answer seems reasonable (should be larger than the area of a circle with radius 5 cm)\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the lack of any previous actions, we should start by implementing the formula for the surface area of a sphere. The formula is A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where A is the surface area and r is the radius.\n\nWe know that the radius is 5 cm. Let's substitute this into our formula:\n\nA = 4\u03c0(5\u00b2)\n\nTo proceed, we need to:\n1. Calculate 5\u00b2 (5 squared)\n2. Multiply the result by 4\u03c0\n\nFor precise calculation, we should use an accurate value of \u03c0. While 3.14159 is a good approximation, using a calculator or search engine to get a more precise value of \u03c0 would be beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to use a calculator to:\n1. Calculate 5\u00b2\n2. Multiply the result by 4\u03c0, using the most precise value of \u03c0 available\n\nThis will give us the surface area in square centimeters (cm\u00b2).\n",
