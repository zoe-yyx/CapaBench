    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Circle P with radius 10 units\n   - Chord AB is perpendicular to radius PC\n   - D is the midpoint of PC\n   - PD = 5 units\n\n2. Identify the geometric relationships:\n   - Triangle PDC is a right-angled triangle\n   - AD and DB are equal (D is the midpoint of AB)\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Use the right triangle PDC\n   - Calculate DC using PD and PC\n\n4. Determine the length of AD (half of AB):\n   - AD = DC (since D is the midpoint of AB)\n\n5. Calculate the full length of chord AB:\n   - AB = 2 * AD\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable given the circle's radius\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the length of chord AB in units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation and the given information, let's continue our reasoning:\n\n1. We have calculated DC using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   DC = \u221a(10^2 - 5^2) \u2248 8.66025403784439 units\n\n2. Since D is the midpoint of chord AB, we know that AD = DB = DC\n   Therefore, AD \u2248 8.66025403784439 units\n\n3. To find the full length of chord AB, we need to double the length of AD:\n   AB = 2 * AD\n\n4. The acting agent should now use the calculator to multiply our previous result by 2 to get the final length of chord AB.\n\n5. After this calculation, we will have our final answer for the length of chord AB.\n\n6. As a verification step, we should check if this result is reasonable given that the radius of the circle is 10 units. The chord length should be less than the diameter (20 units) but greater than the radius (10 units).\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with multiplying 8.66025403784439 by 2 using a calculator to get the final length of chord AB.\n",
