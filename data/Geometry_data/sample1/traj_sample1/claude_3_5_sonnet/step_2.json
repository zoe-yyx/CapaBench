    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Circle P with radius 10 units\n   - Chord AB is perpendicular to radius PC\n   - D is the midpoint of PC\n   - PD = 5 units\n\n2. Identify the geometric relationships:\n   - Triangle PDC is a right-angled triangle\n   - AD and DB are equal (D is the midpoint of AB)\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Use the right triangle PDC\n   - Calculate DC using PD and PC\n\n4. Determine the length of AD (half of AB):\n   - AD = DC (since D is the midpoint of AB)\n\n5. Calculate the full length of chord AB:\n   - AB = 2 * AD\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable given the circle's radius\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the length of chord AB in units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations performed and the given information, we can now conclude our reasoning:\n\n1. We have calculated the length of chord AB:\n   AB = 2 * 8.66025403784439 \u2248 17.3205080756888 units\n\n2. This result is consistent with our expectations:\n   - It's less than the diameter (20 units)\n   - It's greater than the radius (10 units)\n\n3. The value we've obtained is actually \u221a3 * 10, which is a notable geometric relationship:\n   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of sides is 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n   - Our chord forms two 30-60-90 triangles within the circle\n\n4. We can express our final answer more precisely as:\n   AB = 10\u221a3 units\n\n5. No further calculations are needed. The acting agent should now present this as the final answer.\n\n6. To reinforce understanding, we can note that:\n   - Chord AB divides the circle into two equal segments\n   - Angle APB is 60\u00b0 (forming an equilateral triangle)\n\nThe acting agent should proceed to present the final answer: The length of chord AB is 10\u221a3 units, or approximately 17.32 units.\n",
