    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Circle P with radius 10 units\n   - Chord AB is perpendicular to radius PC\n   - D is the midpoint of PC\n   - PD = 5 units\n\n2. Identify the geometric relationships:\n   - Triangle PDC is a right-angled triangle\n   - AD and DB are equal (D is the midpoint of AB)\n\n3. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - Use the right triangle PDC\n   - Calculate DC using PD and PC\n\n4. Determine the length of AD (half of AB):\n   - AD = DC (since D is the midpoint of AB)\n\n5. Calculate the full length of chord AB:\n   - AB = 2 * AD\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable given the circle's radius\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the length of chord AB in units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, let's guide the acting agent through the reasoning process:\n\n1. We know that PD = 5 units and the radius of the circle (PC) is 10 units. This means that D is indeed the midpoint of PC as stated in the problem.\n\n2. Since chord AB is perpendicular to radius PC at point D, we have a right-angled triangle PDC. We can use this to find DC.\n\n3. In the right-angled triangle PDC:\n   - The hypotenuse PC = 10 units (radius of the circle)\n   - PD = 5 units\n   - We need to find DC\n\n4. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find DC:\n   PC^2 = PD^2 + DC^2\n   10^2 = 5^2 + DC^2\n   \n5. Once we find DC, we will know the length of AD (since D is the midpoint of AB, AD = DC).\n\n6. The full length of chord AB will be twice the length of AD.\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to solve for DC using the Pythagorean theorem equation we've set up. This will give us the length of AD, which we can then double to find the length of AB.\n",
