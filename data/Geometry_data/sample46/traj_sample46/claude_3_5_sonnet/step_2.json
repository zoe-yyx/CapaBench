    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Diagonal Paper Folding Problem:\n\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Picture a square piece of paper with side length 1.\n   - Imagine folding it along one of its diagonals.\n\n2. Identify key geometric concepts:\n   - Recall properties of squares and triangles.\n   - Consider the relationship between the diagonal and sides of a square.\n\n3. Determine the shape after folding:\n   - Recognize that folding along a diagonal creates two right triangles.\n\n4. Calculate the length of the diagonal:\n   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal length of the original square.\n\n5. Analyze the folded shape:\n   - Understand that the diagonal becomes a side of the folded shape.\n   - Identify that the other two sides of the folded triangle are equal.\n\n6. Find the maximum side length:\n   - Compare the length of the diagonal (now a side) with the original side length.\n   - Determine which is longer to identify the maximum side length.\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Double-check calculations and reasoning.\n   - Ensure the answer makes logical sense in the context of the problem.\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - Clearly state the maximum side length of the folded shape.\n\nThis plan should guide the team to efficiently solve the problem within the 10-round limit, focusing on key geometric principles and step-by-step logical reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations so far, we have determined two important pieces of information:\n\n1. The length of the diagonal of the original square (which becomes one side of the folded shape) is \u221a2 \u2248 1.4142.\n2. The length of each of the other two sides of the folded triangle is 1.\n\nNow, we need to compare these lengths to determine the maximum side length of the folded shape. \n\nIt's clear that \u221a2 is greater than 1. This means that the side of the folded shape that was originally the diagonal of the square is longer than the other two sides.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the maximum side length of the folded shape is the length of the diagonal of the original square, which is \u221a2.\n\nTo present a precise answer, we should express this in terms of the original side length of the square. Since the original side length was given as 1 unit, we can say that the maximum side length of the folded shape is \u221a2 times the original side length.\n\nTo complete our solution, we should guide the acting agent to formulate a clear final answer statement that includes this relationship.\n",
