    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Diagonal Paper Folding Problem:\n\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Picture a square piece of paper with side length 1.\n   - Imagine folding it along one of its diagonals.\n\n2. Identify key geometric concepts:\n   - Recall properties of squares and triangles.\n   - Consider the relationship between the diagonal and sides of a square.\n\n3. Determine the shape after folding:\n   - Recognize that folding along a diagonal creates two right triangles.\n\n4. Calculate the length of the diagonal:\n   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal length of the original square.\n\n5. Analyze the folded shape:\n   - Understand that the diagonal becomes a side of the folded shape.\n   - Identify that the other two sides of the folded triangle are equal.\n\n6. Find the maximum side length:\n   - Compare the length of the diagonal (now a side) with the original side length.\n   - Determine which is longer to identify the maximum side length.\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Double-check calculations and reasoning.\n   - Ensure the answer makes logical sense in the context of the problem.\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - Clearly state the maximum side length of the folded shape.\n\nThis plan should guide the team to efficiently solve the problem within the 10-round limit, focusing on key geometric principles and step-by-step logical reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on the first few steps of our plan. Let's start by visualizing the problem and identifying the key geometric concepts involved.\n\n1. We have a square piece of paper with a side length of 1 unit.\n2. We're folding this square along one of its diagonals.\n3. After folding, we'll have a right triangle.\n\nThe next crucial step is to determine the length of the diagonal of the original square, as this will become one of the sides of our folded shape. To do this, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nIn a square with side length 1, the diagonal forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle where both other sides are 1. Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of this diagonal.\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to use a calculator to compute:\nsqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)\n\nThis calculation will give us the length of the diagonal, which is now one of the sides of our folded shape. We can then compare this length to the original side length of 1 to determine the maximum side length of the folded shape.\n",
