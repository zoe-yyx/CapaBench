    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Diagonal Paper Folding Problem:\n\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Picture a square piece of paper with side length 1.\n   - Imagine folding it along one of its diagonals.\n\n2. Identify key geometric concepts:\n   - Recall properties of squares and triangles.\n   - Consider the relationship between the diagonal and sides of a square.\n\n3. Determine the shape after folding:\n   - Recognize that folding along a diagonal creates two right triangles.\n\n4. Calculate the length of the diagonal:\n   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal length of the original square.\n\n5. Analyze the folded shape:\n   - Understand that the diagonal becomes a side of the folded shape.\n   - Identify that the other two sides of the folded triangle are equal.\n\n6. Find the maximum side length:\n   - Compare the length of the diagonal (now a side) with the original side length.\n   - Determine which is longer to identify the maximum side length.\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Double-check calculations and reasoning.\n   - Ensure the answer makes logical sense in the context of the problem.\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - Clearly state the maximum side length of the folded shape.\n\nThis plan should guide the team to efficiently solve the problem within the 10-round limit, focusing on key geometric principles and step-by-step logical reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result, we now know that the diagonal length of the original square is approximately 1.4142 (\u221a2). This diagonal becomes one side of the folded shape after folding. \n\nNow, we need to consider the other sides of the folded shape. When we fold the square along its diagonal, we create a right triangle. The diagonal (now approximately 1.4142 units long) forms the hypotenuse of this right triangle, and the other two sides are equal to each other.\n\nTo determine if the diagonal (now a side of the folded shape) is indeed the maximum side length, we should compare it to the other sides of the folded triangle. \n\nThe next logical step is to calculate the length of these other sides. We can do this by recognizing that these sides form the legs of a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the diagonal we just calculated (\u221a2), and the legs are equal.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the Pythagorean theorem again. If we call the length of each leg x, we can set up the equation:\n\nx^2 + x^2 = (\u221a2)^2\n\nSimplifying:\n2x^2 = 2\nx^2 = 1\nx = \u221a1 = 1\n\nWe should ask the acting agent to verify this calculation using a calculator.\n",
