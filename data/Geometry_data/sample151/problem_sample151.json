    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the radius be $r = 10$ cm and the chord length be $c = 12$ cm. The distance from the center of the circle to the chord is given by $d = \\sqrt{r^2 - (\\frac{c}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 - (\\frac{12}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8$ cm. \\(\\boxed{8}\\)",
