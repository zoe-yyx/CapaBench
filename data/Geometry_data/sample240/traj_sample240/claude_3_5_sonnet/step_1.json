    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle DEF with point G on side DF\n   - G divides DF in the ratio 2:3\n   - Area of triangle DEG is 12\n\n2. Identify key relationships:\n   - The ratio of areas of triangles with the same height is proportional to their bases\n   - Triangle DEG and EFG share the same height (perpendicular from E to DF)\n\n3. Calculate the ratio of areas:\n   - Area(DEG) : Area(EFG) = DG : GF = 2 : 3\n\n4. Set up an equation:\n   - Let x be the area of triangle EFG\n   - 12 : x = 2 : 3\n\n5. Solve the equation:\n   - Use cross multiplication and algebraic manipulation\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the total area of DEG and EFG equals the area of DEF\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the area of triangle EFG\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 10 rounds, as it primarily involves ratio calculations and basic algebra.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe previous action has set up the equation 12 * 3 = 2 * x using cross multiplication. This is a correct step in solving the proportion we established. Now, we need to solve this equation for x to find the area of triangle EFG.\n\nTo solve for x, we should follow these steps:\n1. Simplify the left side of the equation: 12 * 3 = 36\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n36 = 2x\n18 = x\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to perform these calculations to solve for x. The acting agent should use a calculator to divide 36 by 2, which will give us the value of x, representing the area of triangle EFG.\n\nOnce we have this result, we can verify it by checking if the sum of the areas of triangles DEG (12) and EFG (the value we'll calculate) is indeed in the ratio of 2:3, as required by the original problem statement.\n",
