    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle DEF with point G on side DF\n   - G divides DF in the ratio 2:3\n   - Area of triangle DEG is 12\n\n2. Identify key relationships:\n   - The ratio of areas of triangles with the same height is proportional to their bases\n   - Triangle DEG and EFG share the same height (perpendicular from E to DF)\n\n3. Calculate the ratio of areas:\n   - Area(DEG) : Area(EFG) = DG : GF = 2 : 3\n\n4. Set up an equation:\n   - Let x be the area of triangle EFG\n   - 12 : x = 2 : 3\n\n5. Solve the equation:\n   - Use cross multiplication and algebraic manipulation\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the total area of DEG and EFG equals the area of DEF\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the area of triangle EFG\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 10 rounds, as it primarily involves ratio calculations and basic algebra.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should start by focusing on the key relationship between the areas of triangles DEG and EFG. We know that the ratio of these areas is proportional to the ratio of their bases on side DF, which is 2:3.\n\nGiven that the area of triangle DEG is 12, we can set up a proportion to find the area of triangle EFG. Let's call the area of triangle EFG 'x'.\n\nThe proportion can be written as:\nArea(DEG) : Area(EFG) = DG : GF\n12 : x = 2 : 3\n\nThis proportion forms the basis for our next step. We need to solve this equation to find the value of x, which will give us the area of triangle EFG.\n\nThe next logical step would be to use cross multiplication to solve this proportion. This will allow us to set up an equation that we can solve for x.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with setting up and solving this equation using cross multiplication.\n",
