    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 210\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Observe that 210\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n2. Use angle reduction techniques:\n   - Recall that 210\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0\n   - Apply the cosine of the sum of angles formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n\n3. Simplify the problem:\n   - cos 210\u00b0 = cos(180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0)\n   - Use the formula: cos(180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0) = cos 180\u00b0 cos 30\u00b0 - sin 180\u00b0 sin 30\u00b0\n\n4. Recall common angle values:\n   - cos 180\u00b0 = -1\n   - cos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n   - sin 180\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Substitute known values into the formula\n   - Simplify and calculate the final result\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer is negative (as it should be in the third quadrant)\n   - Confirm the value is between -1 and 0\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in its simplest form (if applicable)\n   - Provide the exact value and, if requested, a decimal approximation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation performed by the acting agent, we have made significant progress in solving the problem. Let's analyze the result and guide the next steps:\n\n1. The calculation (-1) * (\u221a3/2) - (0) * (1/2) = -0.866025403784439 is correct.\n\n2. This result is indeed the cosine of 210\u00b0. We can verify this because:\n   - It's negative, which is correct for an angle in the third quadrant.\n   - The value is between -1 and 0, which is also correct for cosine in the third quadrant.\n\n3. The decimal representation -0.866025403784439 is accurate, but we can express this more precisely in its exact form.\n\n4. Recognizing that \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866025403784439, we can deduce that our result is exactly -\u221a3/2.\n\n5. To confirm this, we can guide the acting agent to square our result and compare it to 3/4.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to verify that (-0.866025403784439)\u00b2 is indeed equal (or very close due to rounding) to 3/4. This will confirm that our exact answer is -\u221a3/2.\n\nAfter this verification, we can conclude that cos 210\u00b0 = -\u221a3/2, which is the final answer in its simplest and exact form.\n",
