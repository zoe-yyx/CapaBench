    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 210\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Observe that 210\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n2. Use angle reduction techniques:\n   - Recall that 210\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0\n   - Apply the cosine of the sum of angles formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n\n3. Simplify the problem:\n   - cos 210\u00b0 = cos(180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0)\n   - Use the formula: cos(180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0) = cos 180\u00b0 cos 30\u00b0 - sin 180\u00b0 sin 30\u00b0\n\n4. Recall common angle values:\n   - cos 180\u00b0 = -1\n   - cos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n   - sin 180\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Substitute known values into the formula\n   - Simplify and calculate the final result\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer is negative (as it should be in the third quadrant)\n   - Confirm the value is between -1 and 0\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in its simplest form (if applicable)\n   - Provide the exact value and, if requested, a decimal approximation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe calculation (-0.866025403784439)\u00b2 = 0.750000000000001 confirms our deduction that the exact value of cos 210\u00b0 is indeed -\u221a3/2. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. The square of our calculated value (0.750000000000001) is extremely close to 3/4 (0.75), with the tiny difference attributable to floating-point arithmetic in computers.\n\n2. This confirms that -0.866025403784439 is indeed -\u221a3/2, as (\u221a3/2)\u00b2 = 3/4.\n\n3. We have now verified that cos 210\u00b0 = -\u221a3/2 both through calculation and geometric reasoning (being in the third quadrant and having the same magnitude as cos 30\u00b0).\n\nAt this point, we have successfully solved the problem and verified our answer. The next step should be to formally present the final answer, including both the exact form and the decimal approximation if required.\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to state the final answer as:\n\ncos 210\u00b0 = -\u221a3/2 \u2248 -0.866025403784439\n\nThis presentation provides both the exact value (which is preferred in mathematical contexts) and its decimal approximation (which might be useful in applied scenarios).\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The acting agent included the mathematical notation and equation in the final answer, which is not necessary and can lead to errors in automated grading systems.\n\nImprovement: The acting agent should provide only the numerical value as the final answer, without including any additional mathematical notation or context.\n```\n\nThe reasoning and calculation process was correct, leading to the accurate value of cos 210\u00b0. However, the error occurred in the final presentation of the answer. The acting agent included the full equation \"cos 210\u00b0 = -\u221a3/2\" instead of simply stating the value \"-\u221a3/2\".\n\nFor future problems, it's crucial to emphasize that the final answer should be presented in its simplest form without any additional context or notation. In this case, the correct response would have been just \"-\u221a3/2\" or \"-\u221a3/2\" without the \"cos 210\u00b0 =\" part.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that keeping the answer in its exact form (as a fraction with a square root) rather than using the decimal approximation was the correct approach. This aligns with the guideline to retain fractions, radicals, and other exact forms when not explicitly asked for a decimal representation.\n\nFor upcoming rounds, the acting agent should be instructed to:\n1. Calculate and verify the answer thoroughly, as was done in this case.\n2. Present only the final numerical value as the answer, without including the original equation or any additional context.\n3. Retain exact forms (fractions, radicals, etc.) unless specifically asked for a decimal approximation.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the LLM agents can improve their performance in providing correct and appropriately formatted answers to mathematical problems.",
