    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 210\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Observe that 210\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n2. Use angle reduction techniques:\n   - Recall that 210\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0\n   - Apply the cosine of the sum of angles formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n\n3. Simplify the problem:\n   - cos 210\u00b0 = cos(180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0)\n   - Use the formula: cos(180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0) = cos 180\u00b0 cos 30\u00b0 - sin 180\u00b0 sin 30\u00b0\n\n4. Recall common angle values:\n   - cos 180\u00b0 = -1\n   - cos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n   - sin 180\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - Substitute known values into the formula\n   - Simplify and calculate the final result\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer is negative (as it should be in the third quadrant)\n   - Confirm the value is between -1 and 0\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in its simplest form (if applicable)\n   - Provide the exact value and, if requested, a decimal approximation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nOur calculation and reasoning process was correct, leading us to the accurate value of cos 210\u00b0. However, we need to adjust how we present the final answer. Here's the reasoning for the correct presentation:\n\n1. We have confirmed that cos 210\u00b0 is equal to -\u221a3/2.\n\n2. This is the exact value and should be presented as is, without any additional context or notation.\n\n3. We should not include the original equation \"cos 210\u00b0 =\" in the answer, as this is not part of the numerical result.\n\n4. The decimal approximation (-0.866025403784439) is not necessary unless specifically requested in the problem statement.\n\n5.
