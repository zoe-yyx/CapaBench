    "reasoning": "\nTo compute cos 210\u00b0, we need to apply angle reduction techniques as 210\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value. Let's break this down:\n\n1. First, we recognize that 210\u00b0 can be written as 180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0. This is crucial because we can use the cosine of the sum of angles formula.\n\n2. We'll use the formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n   In our case, A = 180\u00b0 and B = 30\u00b0\n\n3. So, we can rewrite our problem as:\n   cos 210\u00b0 = cos(180\u00b0 + 30\u00b0) = cos 180\u00b0 cos 30\u00b0 - sin 180\u00b0 sin 30\u00b0\n\n4. Now, we need to recall the values for cos 180\u00b0, cos 30\u00b0, sin 180\u00b0, and sin 30\u00b0. These are common angle values that we should know or look up:\n   - cos 180\u00b0 = -1\n   - cos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n   - sin 180\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n5. Our next step should be to substitute these values into our equation and perform the calculation.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to substitute these values and perform the calculation step by step.\n",
