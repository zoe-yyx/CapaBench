    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Triangle GHI: GH = 9 units, HI = 12 units\n   - Triangle JKL is similar to GHI\n   - JK = 18 units\n\n2. Determine the scale factor between the two similar triangles:\n   - Compare JK to GH (as JK corresponds to GH in the similar triangle)\n   - Calculate the scale factor: 18 / 9 = 2\n\n3. Use the scale factor to find KL:\n   - KL corresponds to HI in the original triangle\n   - Apply the scale factor to HI (12 units) to find KL\n\n4. Perform the final calculation:\n   - KL = 12 * 2 = 24 units\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the ratio of corresponding sides is consistent\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - The length of side KL is 24 units\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 10 rounds, as it involves straightforward similarity calculations.\n",
