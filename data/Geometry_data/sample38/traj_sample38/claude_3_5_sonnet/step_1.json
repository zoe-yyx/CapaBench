    "observation": "In triangle $GHI$, side $GH = 9$ units and side $HI = 12$ units. Triangle $JKL$ is similar to triangle $GHI$ with side $JK = 18$ units. Find the length of side $KL$.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Triangle GHI: GH = 9 units, HI = 12 units\n   - Triangle JKL is similar to GHI\n   - JK = 18 units\n\n2. Determine the scale factor between the two similar triangles:\n   - Compare JK to GH (as JK corresponds to GH in the similar triangle)\n   - Calculate the scale factor: 18 / 9 = 2\n\n3. Use the scale factor to find KL:\n   - KL corresponds to HI in the original triangle\n   - Apply the scale factor to HI (12 units) to find KL\n\n4. Perform the final calculation:\n   - KL = 12 * 2 = 24 units\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the ratio of corresponding sides is consistent\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - The length of side KL is 24 units\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 10 rounds, as it involves straightforward similarity calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the scale factor to be 2, we can proceed with the next step in our problem-solving strategy. The scale factor of 2 means that all sides of triangle JKL are twice as long as the corresponding sides of triangle GHI.\n\nGiven:\n1. Triangle GHI: HI = 12 units\n2. Scale factor = 2\n\nWe need to find the length of side KL in triangle JKL. Since KL corresponds to HI in the similar triangle GHI, we can use the scale factor to determine its length.\n\nThe next logical step is to multiply the length of HI by the scale factor:\n\nKL = HI * scale factor\nKL = 12 * 2\n\nTo get the precise value of KL, we should perform this multiplication. This will give us the final answer to our problem.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 12 by 2 to find the length of side KL.\n",
