    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key properties of parallelograms:\n   - Opposite angles are congruent\n   - Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180\u00b0)\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - In parallelogram JKML, angle J = 75\u00b0\n\n3. Use the properties of parallelograms to determine angle M:\n   - Since opposite angles are congruent, angle M = angle J = 75\u00b0\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if adjacent angles are supplementary (75\u00b0 + 105\u00b0 = 180\u00b0)\n\n5. Formulate the final answer:\n   - Angle M = 75\u00b0\n\nThis plan should lead to a straightforward solution within 1-2 rounds, as the problem can be solved directly using basic parallelogram properties without need for complex calculations or additional information searches.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the properties of parallelograms, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. We are given that angle J in parallelogram JKML is 75\u00b0.\n\n2. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are congruent. This means that angle M, which is opposite to angle J, must also be 75\u00b0.\n\n3. We can verify this by considering that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (sum to 180\u00b0). If angle J is 75\u00b0, its adjacent angle (either angle K or angle L) must be 180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0. This confirms that our reasoning is correct.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that angle M is 75\u00b0.\n\nThe acting agent should now be able to state the answer directly without needing to perform any calculations or searches. The solution is straightforward and follows directly from the properties of parallelograms.\n",
