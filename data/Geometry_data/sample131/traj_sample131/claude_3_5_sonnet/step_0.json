    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rhombus Problem:\n\n1. Identify known information:\n   - Perimeter of the rhombus = 40 units\n   - One diagonal = 12 units\n   - Goal: Find the length of the other diagonal\n\n2. Recall key properties of a rhombus:\n   - All sides are equal in length\n   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles\n\n3. Calculate the side length of the rhombus:\n   - Side length = Perimeter \u00f7 4\n\n4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation:\n   - Let the unknown diagonal be 2x\n   - Half of the known diagonal is 6\n   - Form a right triangle using half of each diagonal\n\n5. Solve the equation for x:\n   - Use the side length and the half-diagonals in the Pythagorean theorem\n\n6. Calculate the full length of the unknown diagonal:\n   - Multiply the solved x value by 2\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated diagonal makes sense within the context of the rhombus\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the other diagonal\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometry principles and algebraic problem-solving techniques.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe should start by calculating the side length of the rhombus. This is a crucial first step that will allow us to proceed with the rest of the solution. \n\nAccording to the plan, we can find the side length by dividing the perimeter by 4, since all sides of a rhombus are equal. \n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use a calculator to perform this calculation:\nPerimeter = 40 units\nSide length = 40 \u00f7 4\n\nThis calculation will give us the length of one side of the rhombus, which we'll need for the subsequent steps involving the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
