    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a circle with center O\n   - Two radii OA and OB form an angle of 60\u00b0\n   - We need to find the measure of arc AB\n\n2. Recall the relationship between central angles and arc measures:\n   - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it\n\n3. Apply the knowledge to our problem:\n   - The central angle AOB is 60\u00b0\n   - Therefore, the measure of arc AB is also 60\u00b0\n\n4. Consider if any additional steps are needed:\n   - In this case, no further calculations are required\n   - The answer is already in the correct unit (degrees)\n\n5. Prepare to state the final answer:\n   - The measure of arc AB is 60\u00b0\n\n6. Reflect on the solution:\n   - Verify that the answer makes sense\n   - Consider if there are any alternative methods to solve this problem\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the nature of the problem, we can proceed directly to the solution without needing additional calculations or information searches. The key reasoning steps are:\n\n1. Recall the fundamental relationship between central angles and arc measures in a circle:\n   - The measure of an arc is always equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.\n\n2. Apply this principle to the given problem:\n   - We are given that the central angle formed by radii OA and OB is 60\u00b0.\n   - Therefore, the arc AB that these radii subtend must also measure 60\u00b0.\n\n3. Confirm that no additional steps or conversions are needed:\n   - The question asks for the measure of the arc in degrees, which is exactly what we've determined.\n\nThis reasoning leads us directly to the solution without requiring any calculations or additional information. The acting agent can proceed to state the final answer based on this logical deduction.\n",
