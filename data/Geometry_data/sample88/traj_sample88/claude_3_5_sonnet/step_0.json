    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - There are two similar triangles\n   - Smaller triangle perimeter: 30 cm\n   - Larger triangle perimeter: 45 cm\n   - Longest side of smaller triangle: 12 cm\n\n2. Recall the properties of similar triangles:\n   - Corresponding angles are equal\n   - Corresponding sides are proportional\n\n3. Calculate the scale factor between the triangles:\n   - Divide the perimeter of the larger triangle by the perimeter of the smaller triangle\n\n4. Use the scale factor to find the longest side of the larger triangle:\n   - Multiply the longest side of the smaller triangle by the scale factor\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated length makes sense in relation to the given information\n   - Ensure the answer is expressed in centimeters\n\n6. If needed, round the final answer to an appropriate number of decimal places\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds of calculations and reasoning.\n",
