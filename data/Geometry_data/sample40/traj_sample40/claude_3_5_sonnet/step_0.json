    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR is similar to triangle STU\n   - PQ = 15 cm\n   - QR = 20 cm\n   - ST = 45 cm\n   - We need to find the length of TU\n\n2. Recall the properties of similar triangles:\n   - Corresponding angles are equal\n   - Corresponding sides are proportional\n\n3. Identify the scale factor:\n   - Compare the known side lengths of both triangles\n   - ST = 45 cm and PQ = 15 cm\n   - Calculate the scale factor: 45 \u00f7 15 = 3\n\n4. Use the scale factor to find TU:\n   - TU corresponds to QR in the similar triangle\n   - QR = 20 cm\n   - Apply the scale factor to QR to find TU\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - TU = 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 cm\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the proportion holds for all known sides\n   - PQ : ST = QR : TU\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The length of side TU is 60 cm\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to focus on the concept of similar triangles and their proportional sides. We have already identified that triangle PQR is similar to triangle STU, and we know the lengths of some corresponding sides.\n\nThe key step now is to determine the scale factor between these similar triangles. We can do this by comparing the known corresponding sides:\n\nPQ = 15 cm and ST = 45 cm\n\nThese are corresponding sides in the similar triangles. To find the scale factor, we should divide the larger side by the smaller side:\n\nScale factor = ST \u00f7 PQ = 45 \u00f7 15\n\nThis calculation will give us the scale factor, which we can then use to find the length of TU. Since TU corresponds to QR in the similar triangle, and we know QR = 20 cm, we can multiply QR by the scale factor to find TU.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to calculate the scale factor by dividing 45 by 15 using a calculator. This will set us up to then find the length of TU in the subsequent step.\n",
