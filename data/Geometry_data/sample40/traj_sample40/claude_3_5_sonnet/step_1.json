    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR is similar to triangle STU\n   - PQ = 15 cm\n   - QR = 20 cm\n   - ST = 45 cm\n   - We need to find the length of TU\n\n2. Recall the properties of similar triangles:\n   - Corresponding angles are equal\n   - Corresponding sides are proportional\n\n3. Identify the scale factor:\n   - Compare the known side lengths of both triangles\n   - ST = 45 cm and PQ = 15 cm\n   - Calculate the scale factor: 45 \u00f7 15 = 3\n\n4. Use the scale factor to find TU:\n   - TU corresponds to QR in the similar triangle\n   - QR = 20 cm\n   - Apply the scale factor to QR to find TU\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - TU = 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 cm\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the proportion holds for all known sides\n   - PQ : ST = QR : TU\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The length of side TU is 60 cm\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the scale factor to be 3, we can proceed to use this information to find the length of side TU. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We know that triangle PQR is similar to triangle STU, and we've found that the scale factor between them is 3.\n\n2. We are given that QR = 20 cm in the smaller triangle PQR.\n\n3. Since TU corresponds to QR in the similar triangle STU, and similar triangles have proportional sides, we can conclude that TU will be 3 times the length of QR.\n\n4. To find the length of TU, we need to multiply the length of QR by the scale factor.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to multiply 20 (the length of QR) by 3 (our scale factor) to determine the length of TU. This calculation will give us the final answer we're looking for.\n",
