    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR is similar to triangle STU\n   - PQ = 15 cm\n   - QR = 20 cm\n   - ST = 45 cm\n   - We need to find the length of TU\n\n2. Recall the properties of similar triangles:\n   - Corresponding angles are equal\n   - Corresponding sides are proportional\n\n3. Identify the scale factor:\n   - Compare the known side lengths of both triangles\n   - ST = 45 cm and PQ = 15 cm\n   - Calculate the scale factor: 45 \u00f7 15 = 3\n\n4. Use the scale factor to find TU:\n   - TU corresponds to QR in the similar triangle\n   - QR = 20 cm\n   - Apply the scale factor to QR to find TU\n\n5. Perform the calculation:\n   - TU = 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 cm\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the proportion holds for all known sides\n   - PQ : ST = QR : TU\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The length of side TU is 60 cm\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe mathematical reasoning and calculations we've done are correct. We've successfully determined that the length of side TU is 60 cm. However, the issue lies in how we presented the final answer. To address this:\n\n1. We need to provide only the numerical value as the final answer.\n2. We should omit variable names (like \"TU =\") and units (cm) unless specifically asked for in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, our next action should be to present the final answer in the correct format. We should instruct the acting agent to provide only the numerical value 60 as the answer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maintain the accuracy of our mathematical solution while adhering to the expected answer format, which is crucial in automated problem-solving scenarios where precise formatting may be required.\n",
