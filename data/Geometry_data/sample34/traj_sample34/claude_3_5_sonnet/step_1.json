    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key properties:\n   - In a trapezoid, the angles adjacent to each base are supplementary\n   - The sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360\u00b0\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - Trapezoid ABCD has bases AB and CD\n   - m\u2220A = 75\u00b0\n\n3. Determine m\u2220D:\n   - \u2220A and \u2220D are supplementary (adjacent to base AB)\n   - Calculate m\u2220D = 180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0\n\n4. Set up an equation:\n   - Use the fact that the sum of all angles in a quadrilateral is 360\u00b0\n   - Equation: 75\u00b0 + m\u2220B + m\u2220C + 105\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n\n5. Simplify the equation:\n   - 180\u00b0 + m\u2220B + m\u2220C = 360\u00b0\n   - m\u2220B + m\u2220C = 180\u00b0\n\n6. Recognize that \u2220B and \u2220C are supplementary:\n   - They are adjacent to base CD\n\n7. Conclude:\n   - Since \u2220B and \u2220C are supplementary and their sum is 180\u00b0, they must be equal\n   - m\u2220C = m\u2220B = 90\u00b0\n\n8. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the sum of all angles equals 360\u00b0\n   - 75\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 + 105\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - m\u2220C = 90\u00b0\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Recall that in a trapezoid, angles on the same side of a transversal are supplementary. This means \u2220A + \u2220C = 180\u00b0.\n\n2. We are given that m\u2220A = 75\u00b0.\n\n3. Using this information, we can directly calculate m\u2220C:\n   m\u2220C = 180\u00b0 - m\u2220A\n   m\u2220C = 180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0\n   m\u2220C = 105\u00b0\n\n4. To verify this result, let's check if it satisfies the properties of a trapezoid:\n   a) \u2220A + \u2220C should equal 180\u00b0:\n      75\u00b0 + 105\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 (\u2713)\n   b) The sum of all interior angles should be 360\u00b0:\n      Let x be m\u2220B and y be m\u2220D\n      75\u00b0 + x + 105\u00b0 + y = 360\u00b0\n      x + y = 180\u00b0 (which is correct for the other pair of angles in a trapezoid)\n\n5. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that m\u2220C = 105\u00b0.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations and verify the results.\n",
