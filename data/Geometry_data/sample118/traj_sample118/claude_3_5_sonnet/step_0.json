Recall the Triangle Inequality Theorem: The sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.\n\n3. Set up three inequalities based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem:\n   a) 10 + 24 > x\n   b) 10 + x > 24\n   c) 24 + x > 10\n\n4. Simplify these inequalities:\n   a) x < 34\n   b) x > 14\n   c) x > -14 (This is always true for positive lengths, so we can disregard it)\n\n5. Combine the relevant inequalities:\n   14 < x < 34\n\n6. Since x must be an integer, the minimum possible value for x is the smallest integer greater than 14.\n\n7. Determine this integer.\n\n8. Verify that this value satisfies all conditions of the Triangle Inequality Theorem.\n\n9. If verification is successful, present the final answer.\n\n10. If any steps require complex calculations, use the calculator function.\n",
