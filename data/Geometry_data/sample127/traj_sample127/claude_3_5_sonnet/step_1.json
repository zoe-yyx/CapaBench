    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the radius of a circumscribed circle of a right triangle:\n   R = c / 2, where c is the length of the hypotenuse and R is the radius.\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - AB = 7\n   - BC = 24\n   - AC is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse (AC) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\n\n4. Simplify and solve for AC:\n   AC = \u221a(AB^2 + BC^2)\n\n5. Once AC is found, apply the formula for the radius of the circumscribed circle:\n   R = AC / 2\n\n6. Calculate the final result for R.\n\n7. Round the answer if necessary and present the final radius.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry and the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
