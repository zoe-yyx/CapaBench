    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the radius of a circumscribed circle of a right triangle:\n   R = c / 2, where c is the length of the hypotenuse and R is the radius.\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - AB = 7\n   - BC = 24\n   - AC is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse (AC) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\n\n4. Simplify and solve for AC:\n   AC = \u221a(AB^2 + BC^2)\n\n5. Once AC is found, apply the formula for the radius of the circumscribed circle:\n   R = AC / 2\n\n6. Calculate the final result for R.\n\n7. Round the answer if necessary and present the final radius.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry and the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to follow the plan step by step. The first actionable step is to calculate the length of the hypotenuse (AC) using the Pythagorean theorem.
