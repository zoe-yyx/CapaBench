    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a line equation: y = -2x + 8\n   - We need to find where this line intersects the x-axis\n\n2. Recall the key concept:\n   - The x-axis is where y = 0\n\n3. Set up the equation:\n   - Replace y with 0 in the original equation\n   - 0 = -2x + 8\n\n4. Solve the equation:\n   - Isolate x by adding 2x to both sides and subtracting 8 from both sides\n   - 2x = 8\n   - x = 8 \u00f7 2\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Use a calculator to divide 8 by 2\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the x-value back into the original equation to ensure y = 0\n\n7. Present the answer:\n   - State the abscissa (x-coordinate) where the line intersects the x-axis\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the result of the calculation, we now know that x = 4 when y = 0. This means the line y = -2x + 8 intersects the x-axis at the point (4, 0). \n\nTo verify this solution, we should substitute this x-value back into the original equation to ensure it results in y = 0. This will confirm that our solution is correct.\n\nThe next logical step is to:\n\n1. Substitute x = 4 into the original equation y = -2x + 8\n2. Calculate the resulting y-value\n3. Confirm that the y-value equals 0\n\nThis verification step will ensure the accuracy of our solution before we present the final answer.\n",
