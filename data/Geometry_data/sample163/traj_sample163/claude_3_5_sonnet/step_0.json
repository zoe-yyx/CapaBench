    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a line equation: y = -2x + 8\n   - We need to find where this line intersects the x-axis\n\n2. Recall the key concept:\n   - The x-axis is where y = 0\n\n3. Set up the equation:\n   - Replace y with 0 in the original equation\n   - 0 = -2x + 8\n\n4. Solve the equation:\n   - Isolate x by adding 2x to both sides and subtracting 8 from both sides\n   - 2x = 8\n   - x = 8 \u00f7 2\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Use a calculator to divide 8 by 2\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the x-value back into the original equation to ensure y = 0\n\n7. Present the answer:\n   - State the abscissa (x-coordinate) where the line intersects the x-axis\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo find the abscissa of the point where the line y = -2x + 8 intersects the x-axis, we need to follow these logical steps:\n\n1. We know that the x-axis is where y = 0. This means we need to find the x-value when y is zero in our equation.\n\n2. Let's substitute y with 0 in our original equation:\n   0 = -2x + 8\n\n3. Now we have an equation to solve for x. The next step is to isolate x on one side of the equation.\n\n4. To do this, we should add 2x to both sides of the equation:\n   0 + 2x = -2x + 8 + 2x\n   2x = 8\n\n5. Now we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x:\n   x = 8 \u00f7 2\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to perform this division and determine the exact value of x.\n",
