    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of a sector formed by a central angle $\\theta$ in a circle of radius $r$ is given by $A = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\cdot \\pi r^2$. Plugging in the given values, we have $A = \\frac{120^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\cdot \\pi \\cdot (15^2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\pi \\cdot 225 = 75\\pi$ square cm. Therefore, the area of the sector is $\\boxed{75\\pi}$ square cm.",
