    "problem": "If a rectangle with length 4 and width 3 is rotated 90 degrees about its center, what is the diagonal length of the rotated rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "After rotating it by 90 degrees around its center, it will result in a rectangle of the same shape. Therefore the answer is $\\sqrt(3*3 + 4*4) = \\boxed{5}$",
