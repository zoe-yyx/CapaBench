    "observation": "If a rectangle with length 4 and width 3 is rotated 90 degrees about its center, what is the diagonal length of the rotated rectangle?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Original rectangle: length = 4, width = 3\n   - Rectangle is rotated 90 degrees about its center\n\n2. Recognize that the rotation doesn't change the rectangle's dimensions:\n   - After rotation: length = 3, width = 4\n\n3. Recall the formula for calculating the diagonal of a rectangle:\n   - diagonal = \u221a(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2)\n\n4. Plan the calculation steps:\n   a. Square the length and width\n   b. Add the squared values\n   c. Calculate the square root of the sum\n\n5. Use a calculator to perform the calculations:\n   a. 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 9 + 16 = 25\n   b. \u221a25 = 5\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated diagonal makes sense given the rectangle's dimensions\n\n7. Prepare the final answer:\n   - The diagonal length of the rotated rectangle is 5 units\n\n8. If needed, round the result to a specified number of decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should guide the acting agent to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to confirm that the rotation doesn't change the rectangle's dimensions, only their orientation. So after rotation, we're dealing with a rectangle of length 3 and width 4.\n\n2. We'll use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the diagonal length. The formula is:\n   diagonal = \u221a(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2)\n\n3. We need to square both the length and width:\n   3\u00b2 = 9\n   4\u00b2 = 16\n\n4. Then, we add these squared values:\n   9 + 16 = 25\n\n5. Finally, we need to find the square root of 25.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use a calculator to perform these calculations, especially the square root operation. The acting agent should calculate \u221a25 to get the final answer.\n",
