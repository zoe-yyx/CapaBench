    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - ABCD is a square\n   - P is on side CD\n   - DP = 3 times PC\n   - AB = 12 cm\n\n2. Determine the length of side CD:\n   - Since ABCD is a square, all sides are equal\n   - CD = AB = 12 cm\n\n3. Find the position of point P on side CD:\n   - Let PC = x\n   - Then DP = 3x\n   - CD = PC + DP = x + 3x = 4x = 12 cm\n   - Solve for x to find PC\n\n4. Calculate the length of AD:\n   - AD = AB = 12 cm (since it's a square)\n\n5. Determine the area of triangle APD:\n   - Use the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height\n   - Base is AD (12 cm)\n   - Height is DP (which we'll calculate)\n\n6. Calculate DP:\n   - DP = 3 * PC (from step 3)\n\n7. Compute the final area of triangle APD\n\n8. Verify the result and ensure all units are correct\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometry and algebra skills.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, our first step should be to determine the length of side CD and find the position of point P on this side. We know that:\n\n1. ABCD is a square\n2. AB = 12 cm\n3. CD = AB (because it's a square)\n4. P divides CD in the ratio 1:3 (since DP = 3 times PC)\n\nLet's focus on finding the position of P on side CD. We can set up an equation:\n\nLet PC = x\nThen, DP = 3x (since DP is 3 times PC)\n\nWe know that CD = PC + DP = x + 3x = 4x\n\nAnd we also know that CD = 12 cm (because it's equal to AB)\n\nSo, we can write: 4x = 12\n\nThis equation will allow us to find the value of x, which represents PC. Once we have PC, we can easily calculate DP, which will be crucial for finding the area of triangle APD.\n\nThe acting agent should solve this equation to find the value of x (PC).\n",
