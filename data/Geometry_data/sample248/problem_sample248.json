    "problem": "A square ABCD is translated 3 units right and 1 unit up to form a new square A'B'C'D'. If the area of square ABCD is 16 square units, what is the area of the overlapping region between the original and the translated square?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the area of square ABCD is 16 square units, each side of the square is 4 units (since area of a square = side^2). After translating the square right by 3 units and up by 1 unit, the new square A'B'C'D' overlaps with the original square along a strip that is 1 unit wide and 3 units high. Therefore, the area of the overlapping region is $1 * 3 = \\boxed{3}$ square units.",
