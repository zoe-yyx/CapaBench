    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Convex Quadrilateral Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Quadrilateral ABCD is convex\n   - Angle A = Angle C = 120\u00b0\n   - All sides are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA = 10\n\n2. Recognize the special properties:\n   - The quadrilateral is cyclic (can be inscribed in a circle) due to opposite angles summing to 360\u00b0\n   - It's also equilateral (all sides equal)\n\n3. Divide the quadrilateral:\n   - Split it into two equilateral triangles by drawing a diagonal\n\n4. Focus on one equilateral triangle:\n   - Calculate its area using the side length and 30-60-90 triangle properties\n\n5. Calculate the area of the entire quadrilateral:\n   - Multiply the area of one triangle by 2\n\n6. Steps for calculation:\n   a) Find the height of the equilateral triangle\n   b) Calculate the area of one triangle\n   c) Double the result for the quadrilateral's area\n\n7. Formulas to use:\n   - Height of equilateral triangle: h = a * (\u221a3/2), where a is the side length\n   - Area of triangle: A = (1/2) * base * height\n\n8. Final step:\n   - Round the answer to two decimal places if necessary\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry and area calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the height of the equilateral triangle as approximately 8.66025403784439, we can proceed to the next step in our solution.\n\nOur next logical step is to calculate the area of one equilateral triangle. We will use the formula:\n\nArea of triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe know:\n- The base is 10 (as all sides of the quadrilateral are 10)\n- The height we just calculated is approximately 8.66025403784439\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\n\nArea of one triangle = (1/2) * 10 * 8.66025403784439\n\nThis calculation will give us the area of one of the two congruent triangles that make up our quadrilateral. After we have this result, we'll be ready to find the total area of the quadrilateral by doubling this value.\n\nLet's proceed with this calculation to find the area of one triangle.\n",
