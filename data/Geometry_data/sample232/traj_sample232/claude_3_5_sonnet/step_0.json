    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Convex Quadrilateral Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Quadrilateral ABCD is convex\n   - Angle A = Angle C = 120\u00b0\n   - All sides are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA = 10\n\n2. Recognize the special properties:\n   - The quadrilateral is cyclic (can be inscribed in a circle) due to opposite angles summing to 360\u00b0\n   - It's also equilateral (all sides equal)\n\n3. Divide the quadrilateral:\n   - Split it into two equilateral triangles by drawing a diagonal\n\n4. Focus on one equilateral triangle:\n   - Calculate its area using the side length and 30-60-90 triangle properties\n\n5. Calculate the area of the entire quadrilateral:\n   - Multiply the area of one triangle by 2\n\n6. Steps for calculation:\n   a) Find the height of the equilateral triangle\n   b) Calculate the area of one triangle\n   c) Double the result for the quadrilateral's area\n\n7. Formulas to use:\n   - Height of equilateral triangle: h = a * (\u221a3/2), where a is the side length\n   - Area of triangle: A = (1/2) * base * height\n\n8. Final step:\n   - Round the answer to two decimal places if necessary\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry and area calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, our first step in reasoning should be to focus on one of the equilateral triangles formed by drawing a diagonal in the quadrilateral. \n\nWe know that all sides of the quadrilateral are equal to 10, so when we draw a diagonal, it will create two congruent equilateral triangles. Let's focus on calculating the area of one of these triangles.\n\nTo find the area of an equilateral triangle, we need its height. The formula for the height of an equilateral triangle is h = a * (\u221a3/2), where a is the side length.\n\nIn this case, a = 10, so we need to calculate:\n\nh = 10 * (\u221a3/2)\n\nOnce we have the height, we can calculate the area of one triangle using the formula:\n\nArea of triangle = (1/2) * base * height\n\nAfter we calculate the area of one triangle, we'll multiply it by 2 to get the area of the entire quadrilateral.\n\nSo, our next step should be to calculate the height of the equilateral triangle using the formula h = 10 * (\u221a3/2).\n",
