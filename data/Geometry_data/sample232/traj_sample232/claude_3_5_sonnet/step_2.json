    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Convex Quadrilateral Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Quadrilateral ABCD is convex\n   - Angle A = Angle C = 120\u00b0\n   - All sides are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA = 10\n\n2. Recognize the special properties:\n   - The quadrilateral is cyclic (can be inscribed in a circle) due to opposite angles summing to 360\u00b0\n   - It's also equilateral (all sides equal)\n\n3. Divide the quadrilateral:\n   - Split it into two equilateral triangles by drawing a diagonal\n\n4. Focus on one equilateral triangle:\n   - Calculate its area using the side length and 30-60-90 triangle properties\n\n5. Calculate the area of the entire quadrilateral:\n   - Multiply the area of one triangle by 2\n\n6. Steps for calculation:\n   a) Find the height of the equilateral triangle\n   b) Calculate the area of one triangle\n   c) Double the result for the quadrilateral's area\n\n7. Formulas to use:\n   - Height of equilateral triangle: h = a * (\u221a3/2), where a is the side length\n   - Area of triangle: A = (1/2) * base * height\n\n8. Final step:\n   - Round the answer to two decimal places if necessary\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometry and area calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have successfully calculated the area of one equilateral triangle within the quadrilateral, our next logical step is to determine the total area of the entire quadrilateral ABCD.\n\nWe know that:\n1. The quadrilateral can be divided into two congruent equilateral triangles.\n2. We have calculated the area of one such triangle to be approximately 43.3012701892220 square units.\n\nTo find the total area of the quadrilateral, we simply need to double the area of one triangle. This is because:\n\nTotal Area of ABCD = Area of Triangle 1 + Area of Triangle 2\n                   = 43.3012701892220 + 43.3012701892220\n                   = 2 * 43.3012701892220\n\nTherefore, our next operation should be to multiply our previous result by 2 to obtain the final area of the quadrilateral ABCD.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have successfully solved the problem. However, as per the planning strategy, we should consider rounding the final result to two decimal places for a more presentable answer.\n",
