    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the largest square that fits inside a circle with radius 10 units.\n   - The side length of this square will be the answer.\n\n2. Visualize the problem:\n   - Imagine a square inscribed in a circle.\n   - The diagonal of the square will be equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\n3. Recall relevant formulas:\n   - Circle diameter = 2 * radius\n   - In a square, diagonal^2 = 2 * side^2 (from the Pythagorean theorem)\n\n4. Develop solution steps:\n   a) Calculate the diameter of the circle\n   b) Set the diameter equal to the diagonal of the square\n   c) Use the square diagonal formula to solve for the side length\n   d) Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n5. Implement the solution:\n   - Use the calculator for computations\n   - Double-check all calculations\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Ensure the final value makes sense in the context of the problem\n   - The side length should be less than the diameter of the circle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the maximum side length of the square in decimal form, rounded to 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by calculating the diameter of the circle. This will be equal to the diagonal of the largest square that can fit inside the circle. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. The circle has a radius of 10 units.\n2. The diameter of a circle is twice its radius.\n3. Therefore, the diameter of the circle (and thus the diagonal of the square) is 20 units.\n\nNow that we know the diagonal of the square, we can use the relationship between a square's diagonal and its side length to determine the maximum side length. The formula we need is:\n\ndiagonal^2 = 2 * side^2\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the side length:\n\nside = sqrt(diagonal^2 / 2)\n\nGiven that the diagonal is 20 units, we can now calculate the side length. The next step should be to use a calculator to perform this calculation.\n",
