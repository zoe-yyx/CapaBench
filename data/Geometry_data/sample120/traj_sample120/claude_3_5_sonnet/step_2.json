    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the largest square that fits inside a circle with radius 10 units.\n   - The side length of this square will be the answer.\n\n2. Visualize the problem:\n   - Imagine a square inscribed in a circle.\n   - The diagonal of the square will be equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\n3. Recall relevant formulas:\n   - Circle diameter = 2 * radius\n   - In a square, diagonal^2 = 2 * side^2 (from the Pythagorean theorem)\n\n4. Develop solution steps:\n   a) Calculate the diameter of the circle\n   b) Set the diameter equal to the diagonal of the square\n   c) Use the square diagonal formula to solve for the side length\n   d) Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n5. Implement the solution:\n   - Use the calculator for computations\n   - Double-check all calculations\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Ensure the final value makes sense in the context of the problem\n   - The side length should be less than the diameter of the circle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the maximum side length of the square in decimal form, rounded to 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous actions and the planning strategy, we have successfully calculated the exact side length of the largest square that can fit inside the circle with radius 10 units, which is 14.1421356237310 units. We then attempted to round this value to two decimal places as required by the problem statement.\n\nHowever, it appears that the calculator function used in the last action didn't properly execute the rounding operation, as it returned the input command rather than the actual rounded result.\n\nGiven this situation, we need to manually round the number 14.1421356237310 to two decimal places. Let's reason through this:\n\n1. The number we need to round is 14.1421356237310.\n2. We're rounding to two decimal places, so we look at the third decimal digit.\n3. The third decimal digit is 4.\n4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down.\n5. This means the two decimal places we keep (14.14) remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the rounded result should be 14.14 units.\n\nAt this point, we have completed all the necessary calculations and rounding. The next step should be to present this as the final answer to the original problem.\n",
