    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the largest square that fits inside a circle with radius 10 units.\n   - The side length of this square will be the answer.\n\n2. Visualize the problem:\n   - Imagine a square inscribed in a circle.\n   - The diagonal of the square will be equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\n3. Recall relevant formulas:\n   - Circle diameter = 2 * radius\n   - In a square, diagonal^2 = 2 * side^2 (from the Pythagorean theorem)\n\n4. Develop solution steps:\n   a) Calculate the diameter of the circle\n   b) Set the diameter equal to the diagonal of the square\n   c) Use the square diagonal formula to solve for the side length\n   d) Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n5. Implement the solution:\n   - Use the calculator for computations\n   - Double-check all calculations\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Ensure the final value makes sense in the context of the problem\n   - The side length should be less than the diameter of the circle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the maximum side length of the square in decimal form, rounded to 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result provided, we now have the exact value for the side length of the largest square that can fit inside the circle. Let's analyze this result:\n\n1. The calculated value is 14.1421356237310 units.\n2. This value makes sense because it's less than the diameter of the circle (20 units), which is correct as the square must fit inside the circle.\n3. The problem asks for the answer rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to round this value to 2 decimal places. We need to look at the third decimal place:\n\n- If it's 5 or greater, we round up.\n- If it's less than 5, we round down.\n\nIn this case, the third decimal place is 4, so we should round down.\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator or perform the rounding operation to get the final answer in the required format.\n",
