    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The prism has a triangular base\n   - Base triangle sides: 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm\n   - Prism height: 10 cm\n\n2. Recall the formula for the volume of a prism:\n   Volume = Base Area \u00d7 Height\n\n3. Focus on calculating the area of the triangular base:\n   - Recognize this as a 3-4-5 right triangle\n   - Use the formula: Area of triangle = (base \u00d7 height) / 2\n\n4. Calculate the area of the triangular base:\n   - Base can be 3 cm, height will be 4 cm\n   - Area = (3 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 6 cm\u00b2\n\n5. Apply the volume formula:\n   - Volume = Base Area \u00d7 Height\n   - Volume = 6 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Multiply 6 by 10 to get the volume in cubic centimeters\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the volume in cm\u00b3\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometric knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result from the previous action, we have confirmed that the area of the triangular base is 6 cm\u00b2. This aligns perfectly with our planning strategy and sets us up for the next crucial step in solving the problem.\n\nNow that we have the base area, we can proceed to calculate the volume of the prism. Recall from our planning strategy that the formula for the volume of a prism is:\n\nVolume = Base Area \u00d7 Height\n\nWe know:\n- Base Area = 6 cm\u00b2\n- Height of the prism = 10 cm\n\nThe next logical step is to multiply these two values to obtain the volume of the prism. We should guide the acting agent to use the calculator to perform this multiplication:\n\n6 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm\n\nThis calculation will give us the final volume of the prism in cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3), which is the answer we're seeking for the original problem.\n",
