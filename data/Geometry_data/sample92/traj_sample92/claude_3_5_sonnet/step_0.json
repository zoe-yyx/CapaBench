    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The prism has a triangular base\n   - Base triangle sides: 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm\n   - Prism height: 10 cm\n\n2. Recall the formula for the volume of a prism:\n   Volume = Base Area \u00d7 Height\n\n3. Focus on calculating the area of the triangular base:\n   - Recognize this as a 3-4-5 right triangle\n   - Use the formula: Area of triangle = (base \u00d7 height) / 2\n\n4. Calculate the area of the triangular base:\n   - Base can be 3 cm, height will be 4 cm\n   - Area = (3 \u00d7 4) / 2 = 6 cm\u00b2\n\n5. Apply the volume formula:\n   - Volume = Base Area \u00d7 Height\n   - Volume = 6 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 10 cm\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Multiply 6 by 10 to get the volume in cubic centimeters\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the volume in cm\u00b3\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometric knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on calculating the area of the triangular base. The planning strategy has correctly identified that we're dealing with a 3-4-5 right triangle, which simplifies our calculation.\n\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is (base \u00d7 height) / 2. In this case, we can use 3 cm as the base and 4 cm as the height of the triangle. \n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to calculate the area of the triangular base using these measurements. We should guide the acting agent to use a calculator to perform this calculation:\n\n(3 cm \u00d7 4 cm) / 2\n\nThis calculation will give us the area of the triangular base, which is a crucial component for determining the volume of the prism.\n",
