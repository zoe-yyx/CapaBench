    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon:\n\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:\n   Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides\n\n2. Identify that a pentagon has 5 sides, so n = 5\n\n3. Calculate the sum of interior angles:\n   Sum = (5 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\n4. Perform the calculation using a calculator if needed\n\n5. Recognize that in a regular pentagon, all interior angles are equal\n\n6. Divide the sum of interior angles by 5 to find the measure of each interior angle\n\n7. Perform this final calculation using a calculator if necessary\n\n8. Review the result to ensure it makes sense (should be between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0)\n\n9. Present the final answer as the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometry knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to follow the first steps of our plan. Let's start by applying the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon.\n\nWe know that for a polygon with n sides, the sum of interior angles is given by:\nSum of interior angles = (n - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\nIn this case, we're dealing with a pentagon, which has 5 sides. So, n = 5.\n\nLet's substitute this into our formula:\nSum of interior angles = (5 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\nNow, we need to perform this calculation. The acting agent should use a calculator to compute this value accurately. Once we have the sum of all interior angles, we can proceed to the next step, which will be dividing this sum by 5 to find the measure of each interior angle in the regular pentagon.\n\nAfter the calculation is done, we'll analyze the result to ensure it makes sense within the context of the problem.\n",
