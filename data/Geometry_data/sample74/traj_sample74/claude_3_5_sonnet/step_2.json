    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon:\n\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:\n   Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides\n\n2. Identify that a pentagon has 5 sides, so n = 5\n\n3. Calculate the sum of interior angles:\n   Sum = (5 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\n4. Perform the calculation using a calculator if needed\n\n5. Recognize that in a regular pentagon, all interior angles are equal\n\n6. Divide the sum of interior angles by 5 to find the measure of each interior angle\n\n7. Perform this final calculation using a calculator if necessary\n\n8. Review the result to ensure it makes sense (should be between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0)\n\n9. Present the final answer as the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometry knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations performed so far, we have successfully determined the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon. Let's analyze our results:\n\n1. We calculated the sum of interior angles of a pentagon: (5 - 2) * 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n2. We then divided this sum by the number of sides (5) to find the measure of each interior angle: 540\u00b0 \u00f7 5 = 108\u00b0\n\nThis result of 108\u00b0 aligns perfectly with our expectations:\n\n- It falls between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, which is appropriate for a pentagon.\n- It makes sense geometrically, as it's larger than the interior angles of a square (90\u00b0) but smaller than those of an equilateral triangle (60\u00b0).\n\nAt this point, we have effectively solved the problem. The measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108\u00b0.\n\nThe next logical step would be to verify our answer and prepare to present it. We could:\n\n1. Double-check our calculations by multiplying 108\u00b0 by 5 to ensure it equals 540\u00b0.\n2. Consider rounding the answer if needed (though in this case, 108\u00b0 is already a whole number).\n3. Prepare to express the final answer clearly and concisely.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these verification steps to ensure the accuracy of our solution before we conclude the problem-solving process.\n",
