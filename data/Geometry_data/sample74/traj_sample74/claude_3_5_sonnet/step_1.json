    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon:\n\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:\n   Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides\n\n2. Identify that a pentagon has 5 sides, so n = 5\n\n3. Calculate the sum of interior angles:\n   Sum = (5 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\n4. Perform the calculation using a calculator if needed\n\n5. Recognize that in a regular pentagon, all interior angles are equal\n\n6. Divide the sum of interior angles by 5 to find the measure of each interior angle\n\n7. Perform this final calculation using a calculator if necessary\n\n8. Review the result to ensure it makes sense (should be between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0)\n\n9. Present the final answer as the measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic geometry knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGreat progress so far. We've successfully calculated the sum of interior angles for a regular pentagon, which is 540\u00b0. This aligns with our expectations as it's a value between 450\u00b0 (for a triangle) and 720\u00b0 (for a hexagon).\n\nNow, let's move to the next crucial step in our plan:\n\n5. Recognize that in a regular pentagon, all interior angles are equal\n6. Divide the sum of interior angles by 5 to find the measure of each interior angle\n\nSince we know the sum of all interior angles (540\u00b0) and we know that a regular pentagon has 5 equal angles, we need to divide 540\u00b0 by 5 to find the measure of each interior angle.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division:\n\n540\u00b0 \u00f7 5\n\nThis calculation will give us the measure of each interior angle in the regular pentagon. After this calculation, we'll be able to present our final answer, which should be a value between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 as expected for a pentagon.\n",
