    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the given information:\n   - sin x = 0.5\n   - x is an acute angle (0\u00b0 < x < 90\u00b0)\n\n2. Recall the fundamental trigonometric identities:\n   - sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1\n   - tan x = sin x / cos x\n\n3. Calculate cos x:\n   - Use the Pythagorean identity: sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1\n   - Substitute the known value of sin x and solve for cos x\n\n4. Calculate tan x:\n   - Use the identity: tan x = sin x / cos x\n   - Substitute the known values of sin x and the calculated cos x\n\n5. Round the result:\n   - Round the calculated tan x value to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense for an acute angle\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the result\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the current progress, we have successfully calculated the value of tan x and attempted to round it to 2 decimal places. However, it appears that the calculator function used in the last step didn't produce the expected rounded result. Let's analyze and correct this:\n\n1. We correctly calculated \u221a0.75 \u2248 0.866025403784439\n2. We then accurately divided 0.5 by 0.866025403784439, obtaining 0.577350269189626\n3. The last step to round this value to 2 decimal places didn't yield a numerical result\n\nTo complete the problem, we need to properly round 0.577350269189626 to 2 decimal places. This can be done mentally or with a simple rounding function:\n\n0.577350269189626 rounded to 2 decimal places is 0.58\n\nTo verify this:\n- The digit in the hundredths place is 7\n- The next digit (in the thousandths place) is 3\n- Since 3 is less than 5, we round down, keeping the hundredths digit as 7\n\nTherefore, the final answer for tan x, rounded to 2 decimal places, should be 0.58.\n\nThe acting agent should confirm this result by:\n1.

Checking that this result makes sense for an acute angle (which it does, as it's between 0 and 1)\n\nThis will complete the problem-solving process and provide the final answer as required.\n",
