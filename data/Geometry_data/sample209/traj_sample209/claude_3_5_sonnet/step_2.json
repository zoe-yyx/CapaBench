    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the given information:\n   - sin x = 0.5\n   - x is an acute angle (0\u00b0 < x < 90\u00b0)\n\n2. Recall the fundamental trigonometric identities:\n   - sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1\n   - tan x = sin x / cos x\n\n3. Calculate cos x:\n   - Use the Pythagorean identity: sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1\n   - Substitute the known value of sin x and solve for cos x\n\n4. Calculate tan x:\n   - Use the identity: tan x = sin x / cos x\n   - Substitute the known values of sin x and the calculated cos x\n\n5. Round the result:\n   - Round the calculated tan x value to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense for an acute angle\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the result\n",
