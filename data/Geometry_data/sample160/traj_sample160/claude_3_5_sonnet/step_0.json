Divide 1110 by 360 to determine how many full rotations are present and what the remaining angle is.\n\n3. Use the periodicity of cosine function: cos(\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8 + 360\u00b0) for any angle \u03b8.\n\n4. Identify the reduced angle in the standard range and determine which quadrant it falls in.\n\n5. If the reduced angle is not one of the standard angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, etc.), consider using reference angles or the unit circle to find the cosine value.\n\n6. Apply any necessary sign changes based on the quadrant of the reduced angle.\n\n7. If needed, use a calculator to compute the final cosine value to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n\n8. Double-check the result for reasonableness based on the quadrant and magnitude of the cosine function.\n\n9. Present the final answer, expressing it in the simplest form possible (exact value if available, otherwise a decimal approximation).\n\n10.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to reduce 1110\u00b0 to an equivalent angle within the standard 0-360\u00b0 range. This is because the cosine function is periodic with a period of 360\u00b0, meaning cos(\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8 + 360\u00b0) for any angle \u03b8.\n\nTo do this, we should divide 1110 by 360 to determine how many full rotations are present and what the remaining angle is. This operation will give us:\n\n1110 \u00f7 360 = 3 remainder 30\n\nThis means that 1110\u00b0 is equivalent to 3 full rotations (1080\u00b0) plus an additional 30\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, cos(1110\u00b0) = cos(30\u00b0)\n\nNow that we have reduced the angle to 30\u00b0, which is one of the standard angles, we can proceed to determine its cosine value. The cosine of 30\u00b0 is a well-known value in trigonometry.\n\nThe next step should be to recall or look up the exact value of cos(30\u00b0).\n",
