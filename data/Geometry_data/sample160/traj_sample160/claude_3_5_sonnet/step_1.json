Divide 1110 by 360 to determine how many full rotations are present and what the remaining angle is.\n\n3. Use the periodicity of cosine function: cos(\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8 + 360\u00b0) for any angle \u03b8.\n\n4. Identify the reduced angle in the standard range and determine which quadrant it falls in.\n\n5. If the reduced angle is not one of the standard angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, etc.), consider using reference angles or the unit circle to find the cosine value.\n\n6. Apply any necessary sign changes based on the quadrant of the reduced angle.\n\n7. If needed, use a calculator to compute the final cosine value to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n\n8. Double-check the result for reasonableness based on the quadrant and magnitude of the cosine function.\n\n9. Present the final answer, expressing it in the simplest form possible (exact value if available, otherwise a decimal approximation).\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider if there were any more efficient methods that could have been used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action taken, we have successfully reduced the angle 1110\u00b0 to its equivalent angle 30\u00b0 within the standard 0-360\u00b0 range. We then used a calculator to compute cos(\u03c0/6), which is equivalent to cos(30\u00b0), and obtained the result 0.866025403784439.\n\nNow, we need to interpret this result and express it in its simplest form. The cosine of 30\u00b0 is a well-known trigonometric value that has an exact representation. \n\nThe exact value of cos(30\u00b0) is \u221a3/2. This is preferred over the decimal approximation when possible, as it's more precise and often required in mathematical proofs and further calculations.\n\nTo verify this, we can compare our calculated value to the exact value:\n\n\u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866025403784439\n\nThe decimal representation matches our calculated value, confirming that our result is correct.\n\nThe next step should be to express our final answer as the exact value \u221a3/2, rather than the decimal approximation. This completes our solution process, as we have now found the exact value of cos(1110\u00b0) in its simplest form.\n",
