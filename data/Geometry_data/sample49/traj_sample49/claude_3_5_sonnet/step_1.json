    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Minimum Angle of Rotation for a Regular Pentagon:\n\n1. Understand the properties of a regular pentagon:\n   - 5 equal sides\n   - 5 equal angles\n   - 360 degrees in total for all internal angles\n\n2. Recognize that the question is about rotational symmetry:\n   - The pentagon will map onto itself multiple times in a full rotation\n   - We need to find the smallest of these rotations\n\n3. Calculate the internal angle of a regular pentagon:\n   - Formula: (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 / n, where n is the number of sides\n   - Use calculator to compute this value\n\n4. Determine the central angle of the pentagon:\n   - Central angle = 360\u00b0 / 5 (as there are 5 sides)\n   - Use calculator to compute this value\n\n5. Recognize that the minimum angle of rotation will be equal to the central angle:\n   - This is because rotating by this angle will map the pentagon onto itself\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check that this angle, when multiplied by 5, gives a full 360\u00b0 rotation\n   - Ensure it's the smallest possible angle that maps the pentagon onto itself\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the minimum angle of rotation in degrees\n\n8. (Optional) Convert the answer to radians if required:\n   - Use the formula: radians = degrees \u00d7 (\u03c0 / 180\u00b0)\n   - Use calculator or search engine for the value of \u03c0 if needed\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the given 10 rounds, utilizing mathematical reasoning and basic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result from the previous action, we now know that the central angle of a regular pentagon is 72 degrees. This is a crucial piece of information for our problem.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We have successfully calculated the central angle of a regular pentagon, which is 72 degrees.\n\n2. In a regular pentagon, the central angle is equivalent to the minimum angle of rotation that maps the pentagon onto itself. This is because rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees will move each vertex to the position of its adjacent vertex, effectively creating an identical arrangement.\n\n3. We can verify this result by considering that 72 degrees multiplied by 5 (the number of sides in a pentagon) equals 360 degrees, which represents a full rotation.\n\n4. Given that 72 degrees is the smallest angle that achieves this mapping, we can conclude that this is indeed the minimum angle of rotation we're looking for.\n\n5. No further calculations are needed to solve the original problem.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently state that the minimum angle of rotation about its center that maps a regular pentagon onto itself is 72 degrees.\n\nThe next logical step would be to formally present this answer and, if required, convert it to radians for a more comprehensive solution.\n",
