    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Minimum Angle of Rotation for a Regular Pentagon:\n\n1. Understand the properties of a regular pentagon:\n   - 5 equal sides\n   - 5 equal angles\n   - 360 degrees in total for all internal angles\n\n2. Recognize that the question is about rotational symmetry:\n   - The pentagon will map onto itself multiple times in a full rotation\n   - We need to find the smallest of these rotations\n\n3. Calculate the internal angle of a regular pentagon:\n   - Formula: (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 / n, where n is the number of sides\n   - Use calculator to compute this value\n\n4. Determine the central angle of the pentagon:\n   - Central angle = 360\u00b0 / 5 (as there are 5 sides)\n   - Use calculator to compute this value\n\n5. Recognize that the minimum angle of rotation will be equal to the central angle:\n   - This is because rotating by this angle will map the pentagon onto itself\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check that this angle, when multiplied by 5, gives a full 360\u00b0 rotation\n   - Ensure it's the smallest possible angle that maps the pentagon onto itself\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the minimum angle of rotation in degrees\n\n8. (Optional) Convert the answer to radians if required:\n   - Use the formula: radians = degrees \u00d7 (\u03c0 / 180\u00b0)\n   - Use calculator or search engine for the value of \u03c0 if needed\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the given 10 rounds, utilizing mathematical reasoning and basic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on understanding the fundamental properties of a regular pentagon and how they relate to rotational symmetry. The key insight is that the minimum angle of rotation that maps a regular pentagon onto itself will be directly related to its central angle.\n\nGiven that a regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles, we should start by calculating the central angle. The central angle is the angle formed at the center of the pentagon by two adjacent vertices.\n\nThe formula for the central angle of a regular polygon is:\n\nCentral angle = 360\u00b0 / number of sides\n\nIn this case:\nCentral angle = 360\u00b0 / 5\n\nWe should use a calculator to compute this value precisely. This calculation will give us the minimum angle of rotation we're looking for, as rotating the pentagon by this angle will align each vertex with the position of its adjacent vertex, effectively mapping the pentagon onto itself.\n\nAfter calculating this angle, we can verify our result by multiplying it by 5, which should give us a full 360\u00b0 rotation, confirming that this is indeed the correct minimum angle.\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the central angle using a calculator.\n",
