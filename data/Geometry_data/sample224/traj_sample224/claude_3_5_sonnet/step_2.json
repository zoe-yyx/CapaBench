    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a regular heptagon (7-sided polygon)\n   - It's inscribed in a circle\n   - The circle's diameter is 14 cm\n\n2. Recall the formula for the side length of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle:\n   - Side length = 2R * sin(\u03c0/n), where R is the radius and n is the number of sides\n\n3. Calculate the radius of the circle:\n   - Radius = Diameter / 2\n   - R = 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm\n\n4. Apply the formula:\n   - Side length = 2 * 7 * sin(\u03c0/7)\n\n5. Calculate sin(\u03c0/7):\n   - Use a calculator or search engine to find the value of sin(\u03c0/7)\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Multiply the result from step 5 by 14\n\n7. Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n8. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result seems reasonable (should be less than the diameter)\n\n9. Present the final answer in centimeters with 2 decimal places\n\n10. Reflect on the process and consider any alternative methods or potential optimizations\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the progress we've made so far, we have successfully calculated the radius of the circle (7 cm) and obtained the value of sin(\u03c0/7) (approximately 0.433883739117558). Now we can proceed with the final calculation of the side length of the heptagon.\n\nReasoning for the next operation:\n\n1. We have all the necessary components to apply the formula: Side length = 2R * sin(\u03c0/7)\n   - R (radius) = 7 cm\n   - sin(\u03c0/7) \u2248 0.433883739117558\n\n2. We need to substitute these values into the formula and perform the calculation:\n   Side length = 2 * 7 * 0.433883739117558\n\n3. This calculation will give us the exact side length of the heptagon.\n\n4. After obtaining this result, we'll need to round it to 2 decimal places as per the problem requirements.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to perform this final calculation:\n2 * 7 * 0.433883739117558\n\nThis will give us the precise side length, which we can then round to 2 decimal places to get our final answer in centimeters.\n",
