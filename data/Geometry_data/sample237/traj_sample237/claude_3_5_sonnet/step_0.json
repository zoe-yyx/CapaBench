    "observation": "In triangle $PQR$, point $S$ is on side $PR$ such that $PS:SR=1:4$. If the area of triangle $PQS$ is 3, what is the area of triangle $QRS$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR with point S on side PR\n   - PS:SR = 1:4\n   - Area of triangle PQS = 3\n\n2. Recognize the relationship between triangles:\n   - Triangle PQS and triangle QRS share the same height (perpendicular to PR)\n   - The ratio of their areas will be proportional to their bases on PR\n\n3. Calculate the ratio of PS to PR:\n   - PS:SR = 1:4, so PS:PR = 1:5\n\n4. Determine the relationship between areas:\n   - Area of PQS : Area of PQR = 1:5\n\n5. Calculate the total area of triangle PQR:\n   - Area of PQS = 3\n   - Total area of PQR = 3 * 5 = 15\n\n6. Calculate the area of triangle QRS:\n   - Area of QRS = Total area - Area of PQS\n   - Area of QRS = 15 - 3 = 12\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the areas of PQS and QRS add up to the total area of PQR\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The area of triangle QRS is 12\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on the relationship between the areas of the triangles PQS and QRS. The key insight is that these triangles share the same height (perpendicular to PR) but have different bases on PR.\n\nGiven that PS:SR = 1:4, we can deduce that PS:PR = 1:5. This ratio is crucial because it directly relates to the ratio of the areas of triangle PQS to the whole triangle PQR.\n\nSince we know the area of triangle PQS is 3, and this represents 1/5 of the total area of triangle PQR, we can calculate the total area of PQR.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the following calculation:\n1. Calculate the total area of triangle PQR by multiplying the area of PQS (3) by 5.\n\nOnce we have the total area of PQR, we can then find the area of QRS by subtracting the area of PQS from the total area.\n\nThis reasoning sets up the crucial calculations needed to solve the problem step by step.\n",
