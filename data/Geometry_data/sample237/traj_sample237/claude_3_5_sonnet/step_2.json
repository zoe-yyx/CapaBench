    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR with point S on side PR\n   - PS:SR = 1:4\n   - Area of triangle PQS = 3\n\n2. Recognize the relationship between triangles:\n   - Triangle PQS and triangle QRS share the same height (perpendicular to PR)\n   - The ratio of their areas will be proportional to their bases on PR\n\n3. Calculate the ratio of PS to PR:\n   - PS:SR = 1:4, so PS:PR = 1:5\n\n4. Determine the relationship between areas:\n   - Area of PQS : Area of PQR = 1:5\n\n5. Calculate the total area of triangle PQR:\n   - Area of PQS = 3\n   - Total area of PQR = 3 * 5 = 15\n\n6. Calculate the area of triangle QRS:\n   - Area of QRS = Total area - Area of PQS\n   - Area of QRS = 15 - 3 = 12\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the areas of PQS and QRS add up to the total area of PQR\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The area of triangle QRS is 12\n",

We then calculated the area of triangle QRS: 15 - 3 = 12\n\nAt this point, we have arrived at the final answer: the area of triangle QRS is 12.\n\nTo ensure the completeness and accuracy of our solution, we should verify our result by checking if the areas of PQS and QRS add up to the total area of PQR, as suggested in step 7 of our planning strategy.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to add the areas of triangles PQS and QRS and confirm that they equal the total area of triangle PQR.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this verification calculation:\nAdd the area of triangle PQS (3) to the area of triangle QRS (12) and confirm that the result equals 15 (the total area of triangle PQR).\n",
