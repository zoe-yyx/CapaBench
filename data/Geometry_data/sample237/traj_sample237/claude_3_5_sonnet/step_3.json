    "observation": "In triangle $PQR$, point $S$ is on side $PR$ such that $PS:SR=1:4$. If the area of triangle $PQS$ is 3, what is the area of triangle $QRS$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR with point S on side PR\n   - PS:SR = 1:4\n   - Area of triangle PQS = 3\n\n2. Recognize the relationship between triangles:\n   - Triangle PQS and triangle QRS share the same height (perpendicular to PR)\n   - The ratio of their areas will be proportional to their bases on PR\n\n3. Calculate the ratio of PS to PR:\n   - PS:SR = 1:4, so PS:PR = 1:5\n\n4. Determine the relationship between areas:\n   - Area of PQS : Area of PQR = 1:5\n\n5. Calculate the total area of triangle PQR:\n   - Area of PQS = 3\n   - Total area of PQR = 3 * 5 = 15\n\n6. Calculate the area of triangle QRS:\n   - Area of QRS = Total area - Area of PQS\n   - Area of QRS = 15 - 3 = 12\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the areas of PQS and QRS add up to the total area of PQR\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The area of triangle QRS is 12\n",
    "reasoning": "\nOur calculations and reasoning have led us to the correct solution, and we've completed the verification step as well. Let's summarize our reasoning and results:\n\n1. We established that the ratio of PS:PR is 1:5, which corresponds to the ratio of areas between triangle PQS and the whole triangle PQR.\n\n2. Given that the area of triangle PQS is 3, we calculated the total area of triangle PQR: 3 * 5 = 15.\n\n3. We then found the area of triangle QRS by subtracting the area of PQS from the total area of PQR: 15 - 3 = 12.\n\n4. We verified our result by adding the areas of triangles PQS and QRS: 3 + 12 = 15, which equals the total area of triangle PQR.\n\nAt this point, we have solved the problem completely and verified our answer. The area of triangle QRS is 12, and we have confirmed that this result is consistent with all given information and geometric relationships.\n\nThe next logical step would be to formulate a clear and concise final answer to the original problem. We should guide the acting agent to present the solution in a formal manner, stating the area of triangle QRS and briefly explaining how we arrived at this result.\n",
