    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR with point S on side PR\n   - PS:SR = 1:4\n   - Area of triangle PQS = 3\n\n2. Recognize the relationship between triangles:\n   - Triangle PQS and triangle QRS share the same height (perpendicular to PR)\n   - The ratio of their areas will be proportional to their bases on PR\n\n3. Calculate the ratio of PS to PR:\n   - PS:SR = 1:4, so PS:PR = 1:5\n\n4. Determine the relationship between areas:\n   - Area of PQS : Area of PQR = 1:5\n\n5. Calculate the total area of triangle PQR:\n   - Area of PQS = 3\n   - Total area of PQR = 3 * 5 = 15\n\n6. Calculate the area of triangle QRS:\n   - Area of QRS = Total area - Area of PQS\n   - Area of QRS = 15 - 3 = 12\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the areas of PQS and QRS add up to the total area of PQR\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The area of triangle QRS is 12\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have calculated the total area of triangle PQR to be 15, we can now proceed to find the area of triangle QRS. \n\nOur reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. We know the total area of triangle PQR is 15.\n2. We also know the area of triangle PQS is 3.\n3. Triangle QRS is the remaining part of PQR after subtracting PQS.\n\nTherefore, to find the area of triangle QRS, we need to subtract the area of PQS from the total area of PQR.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the following calculation:\nCalculate the area of triangle QRS by subtracting 3 (area of PQS) from 15 (total area of PQR).\n\nThis calculation will give us the final answer to the problem: the area of triangle QRS.\n",
