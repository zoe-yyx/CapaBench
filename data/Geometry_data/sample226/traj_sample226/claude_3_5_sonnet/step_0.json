    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify known information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with right angle at X\n   - XW is an altitude (perpendicular to YZ)\n   - XY = 9\n   - YZ = 41\n   - Goal: Find length of YW\n\n2. Apply Pythagorean theorem to find XZ:\n   XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2\n\n3. Calculate XZ using the values we know:\n   XZ = sqrt(9^2 + 41^2)\n\n4. Recognize that XW divides triangle XYZ into two similar right triangles:\n   - Triangle XWY is similar to triangle XZY\n   - Triangle XWZ is similar to triangle XYZ\n\n5. Use the similarity of triangles to set up a proportion:\n   YW / XY = XY / YZ\n\n6. Substitute known values into the proportion:\n   YW / 9 = 9 / 41\n\n7. Solve the proportion for YW:\n   YW = 9^2 / 41\n\n8. Calculate the final value of YW\n\n9. Round the answer if necessary and present the final result\n\n10. Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies the original conditions\n",
