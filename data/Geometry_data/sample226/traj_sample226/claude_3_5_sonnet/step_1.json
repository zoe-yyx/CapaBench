Identify known information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with right angle at X\n   - XW is an altitude (perpendicular to YZ)\n   - XY = 9\n   - YZ = 41\n   - Goal: Find length of YW\n\n2. Apply Pythagorean theorem to find XZ:\n   XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2\n\n3. Calculate XZ using the values we know:\n   XZ = sqrt(9^2 + 41^2)\n\n4. Recognize that XW divides triangle XYZ into two similar right triangles:\n   - Triangle XWY is similar to triangle XZY\n   - Triangle XWZ is similar to triangle XYZ\n\n5. Use the similarity of triangles to set up a proportion:\n   YW / XY = XY / YZ\n\n6. Substitute known values into the proportion:\n   YW / 9 = 9 / 41\n\n7. Solve the proportion for YW:\n   YW = 9^2 / 41\n\n8. Calculate the final value of YW\n\n9. Round the answer if necessary and present the final result\n\n10. Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies the original conditions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated XZ = 41.9761837236307, we can proceed with the next steps in our plan. We don't need this exact value for the following steps, but it's good to have for verification later if needed.\n\nLet's move on to step 5 of our plan: using the similarity of triangles to set up a proportion. We know that triangle XWY is similar to triangle XZY because they share an angle at X, and both have a right angle (one at W, one at X).\n\nWe can set up the proportion:\nYW / XY = XY / YZ\n\nWe have all the values we need for this proportion:\n- XY = 9\n- YZ = 41\n\nSo, our next step should be to substitute these known values into the proportion:\nYW / 9 = 9 / 41\n\nFrom here, we can solve for YW. The acting agent should now solve this proportion to find the value of YW.\n\nThe calculation needed is:\nYW = 9^2 / 41\n\nThis will give us the length of YW, which is our goal. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation accurately.\n",
