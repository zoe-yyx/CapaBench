Identify known information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with right angle at X\n   - XW is an altitude (perpendicular to YZ)\n   - XY = 9\n   - YZ = 41\n   - Goal: Find length of YW\n\n2. Apply Pythagorean theorem to find XZ:\n   XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2\n\n3. Calculate XZ using the values we know:\n   XZ = sqrt(9^2 + 41^2)\n\n4. Recognize that XW divides triangle XYZ into two similar right triangles:\n   - Triangle XWY is similar to triangle XZY\n   - Triangle XWZ is similar to triangle XYZ\n\n5. Use the similarity of triangles to set up a proportion:\n   YW / XY = XY / YZ\n\n6. Substitute known values into the proportion:\n   YW / 9 = 9 / 41\n\n7. Solve the proportion for YW:\n   YW = 9^2 / 41\n\n8. Calculate the final value of YW\n\n9. Round the answer if necessary and present the final result\n\n10. Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies the original conditions\n",

The result we obtained is YW \u2248 1.97560975609756.\n\nTo complete our solution and ensure its accuracy, we should take the following steps:\n\n1. Round the result to a reasonable number of decimal places, as exact fractions are often preferred in geometric problems. In this case, we can express YW as 81/41, which is the exact fraction representation of our calculated value.\n\n2. Verify our solution by checking if it satisfies the original conditions of the problem. We can do this by:\n\n   a) Confirming that XW is indeed perpendicular to YZ. This is true by construction as XW was given as an altitude.\n   \n   b) Checking if the Pythagorean theorem holds in the smaller right triangle XWY:\n      XY^2 should equal XW^2 + YW^2\n\nTo perform this verification, we need to calculate XW. We can do this using the proportion:\nXW / YW = YW / WZ\n\nWhere WZ = YZ - YW = 41 - 81/41 = 1600/41\n\nSo, our next step should be to set up this proportion and solve for XW:\n\nXW / (81/41) = (81/41) / (1600/41)\n\nThe acting agent should simplify this equation and solve for XW. Once we have XW, we can verify the Pythagorean theorem in triangle XWY to confirm our solution.\n",
