    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the rhombus:\n   - Plot the given vertices on a coordinate plane to visualize the shape.\n\n2. Identify the method:\n   - Recognize that we can use the formula for the area of a rhombus: A = d1 * d2 / 2\n   - Where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus\n\n3. Calculate the diagonals:\n   - Diagonal 1: From (0,0) to (9,3)\n   - Diagonal 2: From (5,0) to (4,3)\n\n4. Determine diagonal lengths:\n   - Use the distance formula: d = \u221a[(x2-x1)\u00b2 + (y2-y1)\u00b2]\n   - Calculate length of diagonal 1\n   - Calculate length of diagonal 2\n\n5. Apply the area formula:\n   - Substitute the diagonal lengths into A = d1 * d2 / 2\n\n6. Perform final calculation:\n   - Multiply the diagonal lengths and divide by 2\n\n7. Review and verify:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense given the coordinates\n   - Ensure units are in square units as requested\n",
