    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Maximum Perimeter Problem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the maximum perimeter of a rectangle inscribed in a circle.\n   - The circle has a radius of 7 units.\n\n2. Recall relevant geometric principles:\n   - The rectangle's diagonal will be a diameter of the circle.\n   - The maximum perimeter will occur when the rectangle is a square.\n\n3. Derive the relationship between the square's side and the circle's radius:\n   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the square's side to the circle's diameter.\n\n4. Calculate the side length of the square:\n   - Use the derived relationship to calculate the side length.\n\n5. Calculate the perimeter of the square:\n   - Multiply the side length by 4 to get the perimeter.\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the calculated perimeter is reasonable given the circle's dimensions.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the maximum perimeter in units.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing geometric principles and basic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by focusing on the key geometric principle that will lead us to the solution: the maximum perimeter of the inscribed rectangle will occur when it's a square. \n\nLet's reason through the next steps:\n\n1. We know the circle's radius is 7 units.\n2. The diagonal of the square will be equal to the diameter of the circle.\n3. The diameter is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is 14 units.\n4. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.\n\nThe next logical step is to set up the Pythagorean theorem equation. If we denote the side length of the square as 's', we can express this as:\n\ns\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 14\u00b2\n\nThis equation relates the side length of the square to the diameter of the circle. Solving this equation will give us the side length, which we can then use to calculate the perimeter.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on solving this equation in the next step.\n",
