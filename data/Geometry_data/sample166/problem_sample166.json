    "problem": "A rectangle is inscribed in a circle with radius 10 units. What is the maximum area of the rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the circle, hence it is 20 units. Let the sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$. The diagonal's length gives us the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 400$. To maximize the area $ab$, we consider $ab = \\frac{(a+b)^2 - (a^2+b^2)}{2} = \\frac{(a+b)^2 - 400}{2}$. The maximum occurs when $a = b = \\sqrt{200}$, so the maximum area is $ab = 200$ square units. \\(\\boxed{200}\\)",
