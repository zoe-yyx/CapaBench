    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a circle with radius 10 units\n   - A rectangle is inscribed in this circle\n   - We need to find the maximum possible area of this rectangle\n\n2. Recall relevant geometric principles:\n   - The diagonal of the rectangle will be a diameter of the circle\n   - The area of a rectangle is length \u00d7 width\n\n3. Set up a variable:\n   - Let the width of the rectangle be 2x\n   - The length of the rectangle will then be 2\u221a(r^2 - x^2), where r is the radius\n\n4. Express the area as a function of x:\n   - Area A(x) = 2x \u00d7 2\u221a(r^2 - x^2) = 4x\u221a(r^2 - x^2)\n\n5. Find the maximum value:\n   - Use calculus to find the maximum of this function\n   - Take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x\n   - Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x\n\n6. Calculate the maximum area:\n   - Substitute the found x value back into the area function\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the solution makes sense geometrically\n   - Confirm that the area is indeed maximized\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the maximum area of the rectangle\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculated derivative and our goal of finding the maximum area, we should proceed as follows:\n\n1. We have the derivative of the area function: \n   dA/dx = -0.4*x^2/(1 - 0.01*x^2)^0.5 + 40.0*(1 - 0.01*x^2)^0.5\n\n2. To find the maximum area, we need to set this derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n   -0.4*x^2/(1 - 0.01*x^2)^0.5 + 40.0*(1 - 0.01*x^2)^0.5 = 0\n\n3. This equation can be simplified:\n   -0.4*x^2 + 40.0*(1 - 0.01*x^2) = 0\n   -0.4*x^2 + 40 - 0.4*x^2 = 0\n   -0.8*x^2 + 40 = 0\n\n4. Solving this equation:\n   -0.8*x^2 = -40\n   x^2 = 50\n   x = \u221a50 = 5\u221a2\n\n5. This value of x represents half the width of the rectangle. To find the dimensions and area:\n   - Width = 2x = 2(5\u221a2) = 10\u221a2\n   - Length = 2\u221a(10^2 - (5\u221a2)^2) = 2\u221a(100 - 50) = 2\u221a50 = 10\u221a2\n\n6. The maximum area can now be calculated:\n   Area = Width * Length = (10\u221a2) * (10\u221a2) = 200\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to perform these calculations to confirm that the maximum area of the inscribed rectangle is indeed 200 square units.\n",
