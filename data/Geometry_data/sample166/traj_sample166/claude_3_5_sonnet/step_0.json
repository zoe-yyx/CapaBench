    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a circle with radius 10 units\n   - A rectangle is inscribed in this circle\n   - We need to find the maximum possible area of this rectangle\n\n2. Recall relevant geometric principles:\n   - The diagonal of the rectangle will be a diameter of the circle\n   - The area of a rectangle is length \u00d7 width\n\n3. Set up a variable:\n   - Let the width of the rectangle be 2x\n   - The length of the rectangle will then be 2\u221a(r^2 - x^2), where r is the radius\n\n4. Express the area as a function of x:\n   - Area A(x) = 2x \u00d7 2\u221a(r^2 - x^2) = 4x\u221a(r^2 - x^2)\n\n5. Find the maximum value:\n   - Use calculus to find the maximum of this function\n   - Take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x\n   - Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x\n\n6. Calculate the maximum area:\n   - Substitute the found x value back into the area function\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the solution makes sense geometrically\n   - Confirm that the area is indeed maximized\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the maximum area of the rectangle\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on expressing the area of the rectangle in terms of a single variable. The planning strategy suggests using x to represent half the width of the rectangle. Given that the circle's radius is 10 units, we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Express the length of the rectangle in terms of x:\n   - The diagonal of the rectangle is a diameter of the circle, so it's 20 units long.\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can express the length as 2\u221a(10^2 - x^2).\n\n2. Write the area function:\n   - Area A(x) = width \u00d7 length\n   - A(x) = (2x) \u00d7 (2\u221a(10^2 - x^2))\n   - A(x) = 4x\u221a(100 - x^2)\n\nThis area function is what we need to maximize. The next logical step would be to find the maximum of this function using calculus. We should suggest to the acting agent to prepare for taking the derivative of this function with respect to x.\n",
