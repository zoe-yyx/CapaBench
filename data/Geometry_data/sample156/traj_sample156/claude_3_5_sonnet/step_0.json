Identify which quadrant the resulting angle falls in.\n\n5. Determine if there's a common angle (30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0) that this reduced angle relates to.\n\n6. If it's not a common angle, plan to use the unit circle or trigonometric identities to find the cosine.\n\n7. Consider if any angle addition formulas or double angle formulas could be useful.\n\n8. Prepare to use the calculator for any necessary calculations.\n\n9. Be ready to simplify the final answer if it's not in its simplest form.\n\n10. Verify the result by checking if it makes sense within the context of the unit circle.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the original problem to compute cos 780\u00b0, we should start by following the first steps of our planning strategy. The key initial step is to reduce 780\u00b0 to an equivalent angle within the standard 360\u00b0 circle.\n\nTo do this, we need to divide 780 by 360 and focus on the remainder. This division will tell us how many full rotations are completed and what angle is left over.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to perform the division 780 \u00f7 360. This calculation will give us the number of complete rotations and the remaining angle that we need to work with.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be able to identify the equivalent angle within the standard 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 range, which will make it easier to compute its cosine value.\n",
