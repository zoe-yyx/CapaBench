Identify which quadrant the resulting angle falls in.\n\n5. Determine if there's a common angle (30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0) that this reduced angle relates to.\n\n6. If it's not a common angle, plan to use the unit circle or trigonometric identities to find the cosine.\n\n7. Consider if any angle addition formulas or double angle formulas could be useful.\n\n8. Prepare to use the calculator for any necessary calculations.\n\n9. Be ready to simplify the final answer if it's not in its simplest form.\n\n10.
