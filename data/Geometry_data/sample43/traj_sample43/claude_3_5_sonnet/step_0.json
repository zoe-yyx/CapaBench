    "planning_context": "\n1. Define key terms:\n   - Understand what a triangular prism is\n   - Clarify the meaning of \"vertices\" in geometry\n\n2. Visualize the shape:\n   - Mentally picture a triangular prism or use a search engine to find an image\n\n3. Analyze the components:\n   - Identify the number of triangular faces (2)\n   - Identify the number of rectangular faces (3)\n\n4. Count the vertices:\n   - Count vertices on one triangular face (3)\n   - Count additional vertices on the opposite triangular face (3)\n\n5. Verify the count:\n   - Double-check by considering how the triangular faces connect to form the prism\n\n6. State the final answer:\n   - Sum up the total number of vertices\n\n7. (Optional) Cross-reference:\n   - If unsure, use a search engine to verify the answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the nature of the problem, we should start by clearly understanding what a triangular prism is and visualizing its shape. This will help us accurately count the vertices. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. A triangular prism is a three-dimensional shape with two triangular bases and three rectangular faces.\n\n2. To count the vertices, we can break it down into steps:\n   a. First, consider one triangular base. A triangle has 3 vertices.\n   b. Then, consider the opposite triangular base. It also has 3 vertices.\n   c. These two sets of vertices are connected by the rectangular faces, but they don't create any new vertices.\n\n3. Therefore, we can deduce that the total number of vertices is simply the sum of the vertices from both triangular bases.\n\n4. The calculation would be: 3 (from one triangular base) + 3 (from the other triangular base) = 6 vertices in total.\n\nThis reasoning should guide the acting agent to confidently state that a triangular prism has 6 vertices. However, if there's any doubt, the acting agent could be instructed to use a search engine to verify this information or to find an image of a triangular prism to visually confirm the count.\n",
