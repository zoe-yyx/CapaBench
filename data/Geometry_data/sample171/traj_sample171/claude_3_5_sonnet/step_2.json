    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall formulas:\n   - Area of a regular hexagon\n   - Area of an equilateral triangle\n\n2. Calculate the area of the regular hexagon:\n   - Use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n3. Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:\n   - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add the area of the hexagon and the area of the triangle\n\n5. Review and verify:\n   - Check all calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is in square units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the update. It seems there was an issue with the previous calculation for the equilateral triangle's area. Let's correct this and move forward.\n\nTo calculate the area of the equilateral triangle correctly:\n\n1. We need to evaluate \u221a3 first.\n2. Then multiply it by 6^2 (which is 36).\n3. Finally, divide the result by 4.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this calculation step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate \u221a3\n2. Then multiply the result by 36\n3. Finally, divide by 4\n\nThis will give us the correct area of the equilateral triangle. Once we have this result, we can add it to the previously calculated area of the hexagon (93.5307436087194 square units) to get the total area of the combined figure.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be ready to move to the final step of our plan: combining the results and reviewing our answer.\n",
