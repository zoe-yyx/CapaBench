    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall formulas:\n   - Area of a regular hexagon\n   - Area of an equilateral triangle\n\n2. Calculate the area of the regular hexagon:\n   - Use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n3. Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:\n   - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add the area of the hexagon and the area of the triangle\n\n5. Review and verify:\n   - Check all calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is in square units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on the first step of our planning strategy: recalling the formulas for the area of a regular hexagon and an equilateral triangle. \n\nFor a regular hexagon, the area formula is:\nA = (3\u221a3 * s^2) / 2, where s is the side length.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle, the area formula is:\nA = (\u221a3 * s^2) / 4, where s is the side length.\n\nNow that we have these formulas, we can proceed to calculate the area of the hexagon. We know the side length is 6 units for both shapes, so let's guide the acting agent to use a calculator to compute the area of the hexagon first.\n\nThe next step should be to calculate:\n(3\u221a3 * 6^2) / 2\n\nThis calculation will give us the area of the regular hexagon, which is a significant part of our combined figure.\n",
