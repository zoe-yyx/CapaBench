    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall formulas:\n   - Area of a regular hexagon\n   - Area of an equilateral triangle\n\n2. Calculate the area of the regular hexagon:\n   - Use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n3. Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:\n   - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add the area of the hexagon and the area of the triangle\n\n5. Review and verify:\n   - Check all calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is in square units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations we've performed so far, we now have all the necessary information to solve the original problem. Let's summarize our findings and guide the acting agent towards the final step:\n\n1. Area of the regular hexagon: 93.5307436087194 square units\n2. Area of the equilateral triangle: 15.5884572681199 square units\n\nThe next logical step is to add these two areas together to get the total area of the combined figure. This aligns with step 4 of our planning strategy: \"Combine the results\".\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to perform this final addition:\n\n93.5307436087194 + 15.5884572681199\n\nThis sum will give us the total area of the combined figure consisting of the regular hexagon and the equilateral triangle sharing a side.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have our final answer, which we can then review and verify as per step 5 of our planning strategy. We should ensure that the final answer is expressed in square units and rounded to an appropriate number of decimal places for clarity.\n",
