    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall formulas:\n   - Area of a regular hexagon\n   - Area of an equilateral triangle\n\n2. Calculate the area of the regular hexagon:\n   - Use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n3. Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:\n   - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add the area of the hexagon and the area of the triangle\n\n5. Review and verify:\n   - Check all calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is in square units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGreat, we've successfully calculated the area of the regular hexagon, which is approximately 93.53 square units. Now, following our planning strategy, we should move on to calculating the area of the equilateral triangle.\n\nWe recall that the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:\nA = (\u221a3 * s^2) / 4, where s is the side length.\n\nWe know that the side length is 6 units, the same as for the hexagon. So, our next step should be to calculate:\n(\u221a3 * 6^2) / 4\n\nThis calculation will give us the area of the equilateral triangle. Once we have this result, we'll be able to add it to the area of the hexagon to get the total area of the combined figure.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the calculator for this calculation.\n",
