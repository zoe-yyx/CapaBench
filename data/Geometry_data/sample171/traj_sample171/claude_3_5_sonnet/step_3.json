    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall formulas:\n   - Area of a regular hexagon\n   - Area of an equilateral triangle\n\n2. Calculate the area of the regular hexagon:\n   - Use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n3. Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle:\n   - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\n   - Substitute the side length (6 units) into the formula\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add the area of the hexagon and the area of the triangle\n\n5. Review and verify:\n   - Check all calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is in square units\n",
