    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "In a kite, the two sets of adjacent edges are equal. Since $WY = YZ$, angles $W$ and $Z$ are equal. Hence, $m\\angle Y = 360^{\\circ} - m\\angle W - m\\angle Z - m\\angle X  = 360^{\\circ} - 120^{\\circ} - 120^{\\circ} - 20^{\\circ} = \\boxed{100^{\\circ}}$.",
