    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle PQR is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at P\n   - QS is an angle bisector\n   - PQ = 24\n   - PS = 18\n\n2. Identify key geometric relationships:\n   - Angle bisector theorem in triangles\n   - Pythagorean theorem for right-angled triangles\n\n3. Outline solution steps:\n   a) Use the angle bisector theorem to set up a proportion\n   b) Apply the Pythagorean theorem to relate side lengths\n   c) Solve the resulting equation for QR\n\n4. Detailed approach:\n   - Let SR = x\n   - Apply angle bisector theorem: PQ/QR = PS/SR = 24/(18+x)\n   - Use Pythagorean theorem: QR^2 = PQ^2 + PR^2 = 24^2 + (18+x)^2\n   - Combine these equations to solve for x\n   - Once x is found, calculate QR using the Pythagorean theorem\n\n5. Calculations needed:\n   - Setting up and solving a quadratic equation\n   - Square root calculation for final QR length\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Algebraic manipulation of the equations\n   - Ensuring accuracy in calculations\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Check if the final answer satisfies both the angle bisector theorem and Pythagorean theorem\n\nThis plan should guide the team through the problem-solving process efficiently, leading to the determination of QR's length within the allotted 10 rounds.\n",
