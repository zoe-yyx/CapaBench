    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 225\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n   - Note that 225\u00b0 is equivalent to 180\u00b0 + 45\u00b0.\n\n2. Use angle addition formula:\n   - Recall the sine addition formula: sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B\n   - In this case, A = 180\u00b0 and B = 45\u00b0\n\n3. Simplify using known values:\n   - sin 180\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 180\u00b0 = -1\n   - sin 45\u00b0 = cos 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n\n4. Apply the formula:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = sin(180\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = sin 180\u00b0 cos 45\u00b0 + cos 180\u00b0 sin 45\u00b0\n\n5. Substitute known values:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = (0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) + (-1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2)\n\n6. Simplify:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2\n\n7. Optional: Rationalize the denominator if needed:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = -\u221a2/2\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense for an angle in the third quadrant.\n   - Confirm that the absolute value is correct (should be the same as sin 45\u00b0).\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2\n",

We have correctly calculated that sin 225\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2.\n\n2. This result is exact and should be presented in its current form without further simplification or decimal approximation.\n\n3. Both -1/\u221a2 and -\u221a2/2 are equivalent and correct representations of the answer.\n\n4. The negative sign is correct as 225\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n5. The magnitude (1/\u221a2 or \u221a2/2) is correct as it equals sin 45\u00b0, which is expected since 225\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 + 45\u00b0.\n\nTo guide the acting agent:\n\n1.

    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on why the acting agent confirmed a wrong answer:\n\n```\nFlaw: The acting agent correctly calculated the answer but included the problem statement in the final response, which was likely interpreted as part of the answer.\n\nImprovement: The acting agent should provide only the numerical value or expression as the final answer, without restating the problem or including any additional text or notation.\n```\n\nThe calculation and reasoning process was correct, arriving at the accurate result of -\u221a2/2 for sin 225\u00b0. However, the error occurred in the presentation of the final answer. \n\nThe acting agent included \"sin 225\u00b0 =\" in the response, which may have been interpreted as part of the answer itself rather than just a restatement of the problem. This inclusion could have caused the system to mark the answer as incorrect, even though the mathematical value provided was correct.\n\nFor future problems, the acting agent should be instructed to provide only the final calculated value or expression as the answer, without any additional context or problem restatement. In this case, the correct response should have been simply:\n\n-\u221a2/2\n\nor \n\n-1/\u221a2\n\nBy presenting just the value, without any additional text or notation, the agent can avoid potential misinterpretations and ensure the answer is evaluated solely on its mathematical correctness.",
