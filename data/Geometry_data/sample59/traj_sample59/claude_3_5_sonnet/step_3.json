    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 225\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n   - Note that 225\u00b0 is equivalent to 180\u00b0 + 45\u00b0.\n\n2. Use angle addition formula:\n   - Recall the sine addition formula: sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B\n   - In this case, A = 180\u00b0 and B = 45\u00b0\n\n3. Simplify using known values:\n   - sin 180\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 180\u00b0 = -1\n   - sin 45\u00b0 = cos 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n\n4. Apply the formula:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = sin(180\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = sin 180\u00b0 cos 45\u00b0 + cos 180\u00b0 sin 45\u00b0\n\n5. Substitute known values:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = (0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) + (-1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2)\n\n6. Simplify:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2\n\n7. Optional: Rationalize the denominator if needed:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = -\u221a2/2\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense for an angle in the third quadrant.\n   - Confirm that the absolute value is correct (should be the same as sin 45\u00b0).\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   sin 225\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2\n",

We have correctly determined that sin 225\u00b0 equals -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2.\n\n2. Both forms are mathematically equivalent and correct.\n\n3. The negative sign is crucial as 225\u00b0 is in the third quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n4. The magnitude (1/\u221a2 or \u221a2/2) is correct, matching sin 45\u00b0 as expected.\n\nTo ensure the answer is correctly interpreted:\n\n1.
