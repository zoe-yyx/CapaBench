    "problem": "A cylindrical drum has a base radius of 5 meters and a height of 10 meters. A right circular cone with the same base radius and height is placed inside the drum. What is the volume of the space in the drum not occupied by the cone?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of the cylinder is \\pi r^2 h = \\pi \\left(5^2\\right) \\times 10 = 250\\pi \\text{ cubic meters}. The volume of the cone is \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(5^2\\right) \\times 10 = 83.33\\pi \\text{ cubic meters}. The volume of the space not occupied by the cone is 250\\pi - 83.33\\pi = 166.67\\pi \\text{ cubic meters}. \\(\\boxed{\\frac{500}{3}\\pi}\\)",
