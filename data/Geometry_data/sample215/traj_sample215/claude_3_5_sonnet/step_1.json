    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we've made progress in finding the intersection point of the two lines. Let's continue with the next steps:\n\n1. Solve for the x-coordinate of the intersection point:\n   2.5x = 0\n   x = 0\n\n2. Find the y-coordinate by plugging x = 0 into either of the original equations:\n   y = 2(0) + 3 = 3\n   \n   So, the intersection point of the two lines is (0, 3).\n\n3.
