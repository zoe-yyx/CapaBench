Once we have that, we can plug it back into either equation to find the y-coordinate.\n\nNext, we'll need to find where each line intersects the x-axis. This occurs when y = 0 for each equation:\n\nFor y = 2x + 3:\n0 = 2x + 3\n\nFor y = -1/2x + 3:\n0 = -1/2x + 3\n\nSolving these equations will give us the x-intercepts.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to solve these equations and determine the coordinates of all intersection points.
