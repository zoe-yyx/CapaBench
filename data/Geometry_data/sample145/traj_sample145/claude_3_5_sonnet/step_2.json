Recalled the volume formula for a pyramid: V = (1/3) * B * h\n2. Identified the given information: base side length = 10 cm, height = 12 cm\n3. Calculated the area of the square base: B = 10^2 = 100 cm\u00b2\n4.

The next logical step in our problem-solving process is to review the result and ensure that the units are correct, as outlined in step 6 of our planning strategy.\n\nWe should confirm that:\n1. The calculation is correct\n2. The units are properly expressed as cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3)\n\nAfter this review, we can proceed to double-check our calculations if necessary (step 7) and then present the final answer (step 8).\n\nThe acting agent should now focus on reviewing and confirming the accuracy of our result, including its numerical value and units.\n",
