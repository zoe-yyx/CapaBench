    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Right Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify known information:\n   - Triangle ABC is a right triangle with \u2220B = 90\u00b0\n   - AB = 8 units\n   - cos C = 1/\u221a5\n\n2. Recall trigonometric relationships in right triangles:\n   - cos C = adjacent / hypotenuse\n   - Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n3. Determine the relationship between cos C and the sides:\n   - cos C = AB / AC (where AC is the hypotenuse)\n\n4. Use the given cos C value to set up an equation:\n   1/\u221a5 = 8 / AC\n\n5. Solve for AC (the hypotenuse):\n   - Isolate AC in the equation\n   - Perform necessary calculations\n\n6. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n\n7. Substitute known values and solve for BC:\n   - 8\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n   - Isolate BC\u00b2\n   - Take the square root to find BC\n\n8. Perform final calculations to determine BC:\n   - Use a calculator for precise computations\n\n9. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated BC satisfies the original conditions\n\n10. Present the final answer:\n    - State BC in appropriate units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on the relationship between cos C and the sides of the triangle. We know that cos C = 1/\u221a5, and in a right triangle, cos C = adjacent/hypotenuse. In this case, the adjacent side to angle C is AB, which we know is 8 units.\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\ncos C = AB / AC\n1/\u221a5 = 8 / AC\n\nThis equation allows us to solve for AC, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Once we have AC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BC.\n\nThe next logical step is to solve this equation for AC. We should guide the acting agent to perform the necessary algebraic manipulations and calculations to find the value of AC.\n",
