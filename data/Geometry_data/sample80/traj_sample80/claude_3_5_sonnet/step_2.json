    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Right Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify known information:\n   - Triangle ABC is a right triangle with \u2220B = 90\u00b0\n   - AB = 8 units\n   - cos C = 1/\u221a5\n\n2. Recall trigonometric relationships in right triangles:\n   - cos C = adjacent / hypotenuse\n   - Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n3. Determine the relationship between cos C and the sides:\n   - cos C = AB / AC (where AC is the hypotenuse)\n\n4. Use the given cos C value to set up an equation:\n   1/\u221a5 = 8 / AC\n\n5. Solve for AC (the hypotenuse):\n   - Isolate AC in the equation\n   - Perform necessary calculations\n\n6. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n\n7. Substitute known values and solve for BC:\n   - 8\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n   - Isolate BC\u00b2\n   - Take the square root to find BC\n\n8. Perform final calculations to determine BC:\n   - Use a calculator for precise computations\n\n9. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated BC satisfies the original conditions\n\n10. Present the final answer:\n    - State BC in appropriate units\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations and our progress so far, we now have the following information:\n\n1. AB = 8 units\n2. AC \u2248 17.8885438199983 units\n3. AC\u00b2 \u2248 319.999999999999\n\nOur next step is to use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for BC. We can set up the equation:\n\nAB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n\nWe already know AB\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 = 64, and we've calculated AC\u00b2. So we can proceed as follows:\n\n64 + BC\u00b2 = 319.999999999999\n\nTo isolate BC\u00b2, we need to subtract 64 from both sides:\n\nBC\u00b2 = 319.999999999999 - 64\n\nNow, we need to calculate this difference and then take the square root of the result to find BC.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations:\n\n1. First, calculate 319.999999999999 - 64\n2. Then, take the square root of the result\n\nThese steps will give us the value of BC, which is the side we're trying to find.\n",
