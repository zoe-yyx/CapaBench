    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Right Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify known information:\n   - Triangle ABC is a right triangle with \u2220B = 90\u00b0\n   - AB = 8 units\n   - cos C = 1/\u221a5\n\n2. Recall trigonometric relationships in right triangles:\n   - cos C = adjacent / hypotenuse\n   - Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\n3. Determine the relationship between cos C and the sides:\n   - cos C = AB / AC (where AC is the hypotenuse)\n\n4. Use the given cos C value to set up an equation:\n   1/\u221a5 = 8 / AC\n\n5. Solve for AC (the hypotenuse):\n   - Isolate AC in the equation\n   - Perform necessary calculations\n\n6. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n\n7. Substitute known values and solve for BC:\n   - 8\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AC\u00b2\n   - Isolate BC\u00b2\n   - Take the square root to find BC\n\n8. Perform final calculations to determine BC:\n   - Use a calculator for precise computations\n\n9. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated BC satisfies the original conditions\n\n10. Present the final answer:\n    - State BC in appropriate units\n",
