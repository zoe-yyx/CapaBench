    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - We need to find \u03b8 in degrees\n   - tan \u03b8 = -\u221a3\n   - \u03b8 is between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0\n\n2. Recall the properties of tangent function:\n   - tan \u03b8 is negative in the 4th quadrant (270\u00b0 to 360\u00b0)\n   - tan \u03b8 = -\u221a3 corresponds to a standard angle in the 4th quadrant\n\n3. Identify the related standard angle:\n   - The standard angle where tan \u03b8 = \u221a3 is 60\u00b0\n   - Our angle will be the negative of this in the 4th quadrant\n\n4. Calculate the angle in the 4th quadrant:\n   - Subtract the standard angle from 360\u00b0\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated angle is between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0\n   - Confirm that tan of this angle equals -\u221a3\n\n6. Express the final answer in degrees\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometric knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation results and our reasoning so far, we have strong evidence that 300\u00b0 is indeed the correct solution for \u03b8. Let's summarize our findings:\n\n1.

We used a calculator to verify this, obtaining tan(300\u00b0) \u2248 -1.73205080756888.\n\nNow, let's analyze this result further:\n\n- The calculated value -1.73205080756888 is indeed very close to -\u221a3.\n- We know that \u221a3 \u2248 1.732050807568877, so our calculated result matches -\u221a3 to a high degree of precision.\n\nTo complete our verification, we should confirm that this tiny difference is due to normal floating-point arithmetic limitations in calculators and computers, rather than an actual discrepancy.\n\nOur next step should be to calculate \u221a3 directly and compare it to the absolute value of our tan(300\u00b0) result. This will provide final confirmation of our solution.\n\nAfter this verification, if everything checks out, we can confidently state that 300\u00b0 is the correct solution for \u03b8.\n",
