Recall the properties of tangent function:\n   - tan \u03b8 is negative in the 4th quadrant (270\u00b0 to 360\u00b0)\n   - tan \u03b8 = -\u221a3 corresponds to a standard angle in the 4th quadrant\n\n3. Identify the related standard angle:\n   - The standard angle where tan \u03b8 = \u221a3 is 60\u00b0\n   - Our angle will be the negative of this in the 4th quadrant\n\n4. Calculate the angle in the 4th quadrant:\n   - Subtract the standard angle from 360\u00b0\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated angle is between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0\n   - Confirm that tan of this angle equals -\u221a3\n\n6. Express the final answer in degrees\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometric knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe calculation 360\u00b0 - 60\u00b0 = 300\u00b0 has been correctly performed, giving us our potential solution for \u03b8.
