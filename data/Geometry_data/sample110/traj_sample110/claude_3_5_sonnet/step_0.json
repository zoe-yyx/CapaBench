Recall the properties of tangent function:\n   - tan \u03b8 is negative in the 4th quadrant (270\u00b0 to 360\u00b0)\n   - tan \u03b8 = -\u221a3 corresponds to a standard angle in the 4th quadrant\n\n3. Identify the related standard angle:\n   - The standard angle where tan \u03b8 = \u221a3 is 60\u00b0\n   - Our angle will be the negative of this in the 4th quadrant\n\n4. Calculate the angle in the 4th quadrant:\n   - Subtract the standard angle from 360\u00b0\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated angle is between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0\n   - Confirm that tan of this angle equals -\u221a3\n\n6. Express the final answer in degrees\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometric knowledge and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should start by identifying the standard angle that corresponds to tan \u03b8 = \u221a3. This is a crucial step in our reasoning process.\n\nWe know that tan 60\u00b0 = \u221a3. This is a standard trigonometric value that's often memorized or can be easily verified.\n\nIn our problem, we're dealing with tan \u03b8 = -\u221a3, and \u03b8 is in the fourth quadrant (between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0). The negative sign indicates that we're dealing with the reflection of the standard 60\u00b0 angle in the fourth quadrant.\n\nTo find this angle in the fourth quadrant, we can subtract 60\u00b0 from 360\u00b0:\n\n360\u00b0 - 60\u00b0 = 300\u00b0\n\nThis reasoning suggests that our next step should be to calculate 360\u00b0 - 60\u00b0 to find the angle \u03b8 we're looking for. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this subtraction.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll need to verify that this angle indeed satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n",
