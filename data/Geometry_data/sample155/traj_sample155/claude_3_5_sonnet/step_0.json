    "observation": "A chord of length 8 cm is 6 cm away from the center of a circle. What is the radius of the circle?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Draw a circle with its center\n   - Draw a chord of 8 cm\n   - Draw a perpendicular line from the center to the chord, which is 6 cm\n\n2. Identify the key components:\n   - Chord length: 8 cm\n   - Distance from center to chord: 6 cm\n   - Radius: unknown (our goal)\n\n3. Recognize the geometric relationship:\n   - The perpendicular from the center to the chord forms a right triangle\n   - This triangle is formed by the radius, half of the chord, and the perpendicular line\n\n4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - The radius is the hypotenuse of the right triangle\n   - The other two sides are:\n     a) The perpendicular line (6 cm)\n     b) Half of the chord (8/2 = 4 cm)\n\n5. Set up the equation:\n   radius\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 4\u00b2\n\n6. Solve the equation:\n   - Calculate 6\u00b2 and 4\u00b2\n   - Add the results\n   - Take the square root of the sum\n\n7. Round the result if necessary\n\n8. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated radius satisfies the given conditions\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State the radius of the circle in cm\n",
