    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a square\n   - The area of the square is 64 square meters\n\n2. Recall the formula for the area of a square:\n   - Area = side length squared (A = s\u00b2)\n\n3. Solve for the side length:\n   - Use the given area to find the side length\n   - s\u00b2 = 64\n   - s = \u221a64\n\n4. Calculate the square root of 64:\n   - Use a calculator to compute \u221a64\n\n5. Recall the formula for the perimeter of a square:\n   - Perimeter = 4 * side length\n\n6. Calculate the perimeter:\n   - Multiply the side length by 4\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the perimeter in meters\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by focusing on finding the side length of the square. We know that the area of the square is 64 square meters, and we need to use this information to determine the side length.\n\nThe key relationship we need to use is that for a square, the area is equal to the side length squared. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as A = s\u00b2, where A is the area and s is the side length.\n\nGiven that the area is 64 square meters, we can set up the equation:\n\n64 = s\u00b2\n\nTo solve for s, we need to take the square root of both sides:\n\ns = \u221a64\n\nThe next logical step would be to calculate the square root of 64. This is a perfect square, so it should result in a whole number. \n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use a calculator to compute this square root. Once we have the side length, we can proceed to calculate the perimeter of the square.\n",
