    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have a square\n   - The area of the square is 64 square meters\n\n2. Recall the formula for the area of a square:\n   - Area = side length squared (A = s\u00b2)\n\n3. Solve for the side length:\n   - Use the given area to find the side length\n   - s\u00b2 = 64\n   - s = \u221a64\n\n4. Calculate the square root of 64:\n   - Use a calculator to compute \u221a64\n\n5. Recall the formula for the perimeter of a square:\n   - Perimeter = 4 * side length\n\n6. Calculate the perimeter:\n   - Multiply the side length by 4\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the perimeter in meters\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have successfully calculated the side length of the square, which is 8 meters, we can proceed to the next step in our plan: calculating the perimeter of the square.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We have found that the side length of the square is 8 meters.\n2. The next step in our plan is to recall and apply the formula for the perimeter of a square.\n3. The formula for the perimeter of a square is: Perimeter = 4 * side length\n4. We need to multiply the side length (8 meters) by 4 to get the perimeter.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we should guide the acting agent to perform a simple multiplication: 4 * 8. This will give us the perimeter of the square in meters.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have completed all the necessary steps to solve the problem, and we can present the final answer.\n",
