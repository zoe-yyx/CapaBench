    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we should start by focusing on the relationship between tan(\u03b8) and sin(\u03b8)/cos(\u03b8). We know that tan(\u03b8) = 3/4, so we can set up the equation:\n\n3/4 = sin(\u03b8) / cos(\u03b8)\n\nFrom this, we can derive a relationship between sin(\u03b8) and cos(\u03b8):\n\nsin(\u03b8) = (3/4) * cos(\u03b8)\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean identity sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1 to create an equation with just one variable. Let's substitute our expression for sin(\u03b8) into this identity:\n\n[(3/4) * cos(\u03b8)]\u00b2 + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1\n\nThis equation can be solved for cos(\u03b8), which will then allow us to find sin(\u03b8). The next step should be to expand this equation and solve it as a quadratic in terms of cos(\u03b8).\n",
