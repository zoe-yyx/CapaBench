Recall the trigonometric identity relating tan, sin, and cos:\n   - tan(\u03b8) = sin(\u03b8) / cos(\u03b8)\n\n3. Use the Pythagorean identity:\n   - sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1\n\n4. Strategy to solve:\n   a) Express cos(\u03b8) in terms of sin(\u03b8) using the tan identity\n   b) Substitute this into the Pythagorean identity\n   c) Solve the resulting equation for sin\u00b2(\u03b8)\n   d) Take the square root to find |sin(\u03b8)|\n\n5.
