Identify key information:\n   - Initial diameter: 10 meters\n   - Volume increase rate: 523.6 cubic meters per minute\n   - Goal: Find surface area increase rate when fully inflated\n\n2. Recall relevant formulas:\n   - Volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n   - Surface area of a sphere: A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n   - Rate of change relationship: dA/dt = (dA/dr) * (dr/dt)\n\n3. Calculate the radius of the fully inflated balloon:\n   - Use the diameter to find the radius (r = 5 meters)\n\n4. Determine the rate of change of radius (dr/dt):\n   - Use the volume formula and its derivative\n   - dV/dt = 4\u03c0r\u00b2 * dr/dt\n   - Solve for dr/dt using the given dV/dt and r\n\n5. Calculate dA/dr:\n   - Differentiate the surface area formula with respect to r\n\n6. Apply the rate of change relationship:\n   - dA/dt = (dA/dr) * (dr/dt)\n   - Use the results from steps 4 and 5\n\n7. Compute the final result:\n   - Calculate dA/dt\n   - Round to 1 decimal place\n\n8. Verify the answer:\n   - Check units and reasonableness of the result\n\n9. Prepare the final answer:\n   - Express the rate of increase of surface area in appropriate units\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider alternative methods if time allows\n",
