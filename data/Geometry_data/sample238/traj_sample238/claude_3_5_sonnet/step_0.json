Understand the given information:\n   - Triangle XYZ is divided by a line PQ\n   - The line divides the triangle into two equal areas\n   - PQ is parallel to XZ\n   - XZ = 10\n\n2. Recall relevant geometric principles:\n   - Parallel lines in a triangle create similar triangles\n   - The ratio of areas of similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides\n\n3. Set up the problem:\n   - Let the height of the triangle be h\n   - Let the distance of PQ from XZ be y\n\n4. Create equations:\n   - Area of whole triangle = (1/2) * XZ * h\n   - Area of smaller triangle (PQY) = (1/2) * PQ * y\n   - Area of PQY = (1/2) * Area of XYZ (given condition)\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the original problem, let's start reasoning through the solution:\n\n1. We need to set up our equations based on the given information. We know that the line PQ divides the triangle into two equal areas, and PQ is parallel to XZ.\n\n2. Let's denote the height of the triangle as h and the distance of PQ from XZ as y. \n\n3. We can express the areas of the triangles:\n   - Area of whole triangle XYZ = (1/2) * XZ * h\n   - Area of smaller triangle PQY = (1/2) * PQ * y\n\n4. Since PQ divides the triangle into two equal areas, we can say:\n   Area of PQY = (1/2) * Area of XYZ\n\n5. This gives us the equation:\n   (1/2) * PQ * y = (1/2) * (1/2) * XZ * h\n\n6. We also know that PQ and XZ are parallel, which means triangles PQY and XYZ are similar. In similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. So:\n   PQ / XZ = y / h\n\n7. From this, we can express PQ in terms of XZ:\n   PQ = XZ * (y/h)\n\n8. Substituting this into our area equation:\n   (1/2) * XZ * (y/h) * y = (1/4) * XZ * h\n\n9. Simplifying:\n   XZ * y^2 = (1/2) * XZ * h^2\n   y^2 = (1/2) * h^2\n   y/h = 1/\u221a2\n\n10. Now we can find PQ:\n    PQ = XZ * (y/h) = XZ * (1/\u221a2)\n\n11. We know XZ = 10, so:\n    PQ = 10 * (1/\u221a2) = 10/\u221a2 \u2248 7.071\n\nThe next step would be to calculate this value precisely. We should use a calculator to compute 10/\u221a2.\n",
