    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of the triangle is 24. Using the formula for the radius $r$ of the inscribed circle, $r = \\frac{A}{s}$, where $s$ is the semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{6+8+\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}}{2} = 12$, we find the radius of the inscribed circle is $r = \\frac{24}{12} = \\boxed{2}$.",
