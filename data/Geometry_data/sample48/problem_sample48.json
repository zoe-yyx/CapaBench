    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The shorter diagonal of a regular hexagon with side length 1 is found by placing vertices on the coordinate plane and using the distance formula between two non-adjacent vertices, yielding $d = 2 * 1 * sin(60\\circ) = \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$.",
