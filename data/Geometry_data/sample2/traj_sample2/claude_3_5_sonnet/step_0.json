    "observation": "In a circle with center $O$, diameter $AB = 12$ cm, find the circumference of the circle.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - The shape is a circle\n   - Center of the circle is O\n   - AB is a diameter of the circle\n   - Length of diameter AB = 12 cm\n\n2. Recall the relationship between diameter and radius:\n   - Diameter = 2 * Radius\n\n3. Calculate the radius of the circle:\n   - Radius = Diameter / 2\n   - Radius = 12 cm / 2 = 6 cm\n\n4. Recall the formula for circumference of a circle:\n   - Circumference = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\n\n5. Use the calculated radius to find the circumference:\n   - Substitute radius = 6 cm into the formula\n   - Circumference = 2 * \u03c0 * 6 cm\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator to multiply 2 * \u03c0 * 6\n   - Round the result to an appropriate number of decimal places\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the circumference in centimeters (cm)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we've identified the key information and recalled the necessary formulas. The next logical step is to calculate the radius of the circle.\n\nWe know that the diameter AB = 12 cm, and we recall that the diameter is twice the radius. Therefore, we need to divide the diameter by 2 to find the radius.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use a calculator to perform this simple division:\n\n12 \u00f7 2\n\nThis calculation will give us the radius of the circle, which is a crucial piece of information needed for the next steps in our solution process. Once we have the radius, we can proceed to use it in the circumference formula.\n",
