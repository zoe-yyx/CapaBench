    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Original point P is at (2,3)\n   - Reflection line is y = -x\n\n2. Recall the formula for reflection across y = -x:\n   - For a point (a,b), its reflection is (\u2212b,\u2212a)\n\n3. Apply the reflection formula:\n   - Substitute a = 2 and b = 3 into the formula\n\n4. Identify the reflected point coordinates:\n   - New x-coordinate will be -3\n   - New y-coordinate will be -2\n\n5. Extract the ordinate (y-coordinate) of the reflection point:\n   - The ordinate is -2\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the midpoint of the original and reflected points lies on y = -x\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The ordinate of the reflection point is -2\n\nThis plan should allow for a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have the original point P at (2,3) and we need to reflect it across the line y = -x.\n\n2. The formula for reflection across y = -x is crucial here. For a point (a,b), its reflection is (\u2212b,\u2212a). This is because the line y = -x acts as a mirror, swapping and negating the x and y coordinates.\n\n3. In our case, we have a = 2 and b = 3 for the original point P(2,3).\n\n4. Applying the reflection formula:\n   - The new x-coordinate will be -b = -3\n   - The new y-coordinate will be -a = -2\n\n5. Therefore, the reflected point will be at (-3, -2).\n\n6. The question specifically asks for the ordinate of the reflection point. The ordinate is the y-coordinate, which in this case is -2.\n\nThis reasoning leads us to the conclusion that the ordinate of the reflection point is -2. The acting agent should now proceed to confirm this result through calculation or geometric verification.\n",
