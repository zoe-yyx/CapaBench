Recall the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles in a circle:\n   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Circle Q\n   - XYZ is an inscribed angle\n   - Arc XZ measures 80\u00b0\n\n3. Apply the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles:\n   - The central angle corresponding to arc XZ would be 80\u00b0\n   - The inscribed angle XYZ will be half of this\n\n4. Calculate the measure of angle XYZ:\n   - Measure of angle XYZ = 80\u00b0 \u00f7 2\n\n5. Provide the final answer:\n   - State the measure of angle XYZ in degrees\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently, likely within 2-3 rounds at most. The acting agent will need to perform a simple division in step 4, which can be done using a calculator if needed.\n",
