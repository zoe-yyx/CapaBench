    "observation": "A rhombus $ABCD$ has diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ that intersect at $O$. If $AC=10$ units and $BD=24$ units, calculate the area of the rhombus.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the area of a rhombus:\n   - Area = (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Diagonal AC = 10 units\n   - Diagonal BD = 24 units\n\n3. Apply the area formula:\n   - Substitute the known diagonal lengths into the formula\n   - Calculate the result\n\n4. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the calculated area is reasonable for a rhombus with these diagonal lengths\n   - Consider if any alternative methods could confirm the result\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the area in square units\n   - Round to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n\nNote: This problem should be solvable in one or two steps using basic arithmetic operations. The acting agent can use a calculator for the multiplication and division if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we can proceed with the reasoning for solving this problem:\n\n1. We have been given the lengths of both diagonals of the rhombus:\n   - Diagonal AC = 10 units\n   - Diagonal BD = 24 units\n\n2. The formula for the area of a rhombus using its diagonals is:\n   Area = (d1 * d2) / 2\n   Where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals\n\n3. We can directly substitute the known values into this formula:\n   Area = (10 * 24) / 2\n\n4. The next step would be to perform this calculation. The acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 10 by 24, and then divide the result by 2.\n\n5. After calculating, the result should be expressed in square units, as it represents an area.\n\nThis reasoning should guide the acting agent to perform the necessary calculation to find the area of the rhombus.\n",
