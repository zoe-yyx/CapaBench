    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of a rhombus can be found using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2$ where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals. Plugging in the given values, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 24 = 120$ square units. \\(\\boxed{120}\\)",
