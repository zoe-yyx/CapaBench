    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving a 30-60-90 Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n   - The ratio of sides is 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n   - The shortest side is opposite to the 30\u00b0 angle\n   - The longest side is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - The shorter leg (opposite to 30\u00b0 angle) measures 5 units\n\n3. Set up the ratio equation:\n   - Let x be the length of the hypotenuse\n   - The ratio of shorter leg to hypotenuse is 1:2\n\n4. Solve for the hypotenuse:\n   - Use the ratio to create an equation\n   - Solve the equation for x\n\n5. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to compute the exact value\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the hypotenuse clearly\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nOur solution is progressing well, and we've successfully verified most aspects of our answer. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We've determined the hypotenuse is 10 units long.\n2. We've calculated the longer leg to be 5\u221a3 \u2248 8.66025403784439 units.\n3. We've confirmed that the sides follow the order: shorter leg (5) < longer leg (8.66...) < hypotenuse (10).\n4. We've verified that the ratio of the longer leg to the shorter leg is \u221a3 (1.73205080756888).\n\nTo complete our verification, we should:\n\n1. Calculate the ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg to confirm it's exactly 2.\n2. Check if the ratio of the hypotenuse to the longer leg is 2/\u221a3.\n\nThese final checks will ensure our solution fully satisfies the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. \n\nFor the next step, let's calculate the ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg.\n",
