    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving a 30-60-90 Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n   - The ratio of sides is 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n   - The shortest side is opposite to the 30\u00b0 angle\n   - The longest side is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - The shorter leg (opposite to 30\u00b0 angle) measures 5 units\n\n3. Set up the ratio equation:\n   - Let x be the length of the hypotenuse\n   - The ratio of shorter leg to hypotenuse is 1:2\n\n4. Solve for the hypotenuse:\n   - Use the ratio to create an equation\n   - Solve the equation for x\n\n5. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to compute the exact value\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the hypotenuse clearly\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nOur solution is progressing well. We've successfully determined that the hypotenuse of the 30-60-90 triangle is 10 units long. We've also calculated the length of the longer leg, which is 5\u221a3 \u2248 8.66025403784439 units.\n\nTo complete our solution and verify it, we should:\n\n1. Confirm that our results satisfy the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n   - The ratio of sides should be 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n   - The shorter leg (5) < longer leg (5\u221a3) < hypotenuse (10)\n\n2. Calculate the ratios between the sides to verify they match the 1 : \u221a3 : 2 ratio:\n   - Ratio of longer leg to shorter leg: (5\u221a3) / 5 = \u221a3\n   - Ratio of hypotenuse to shorter leg: 10 / 5 = 2\n\n3. Present the final answer clearly, stating that the hypotenuse is 10 units long.\n\nFor the next action, we should calculate these ratios to confirm our solution is correct. Let's start by calculating (5\u221a3) / 5 to verify it equals \u221a3.\n",
