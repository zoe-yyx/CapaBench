    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving a 30-60-90 Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n   - The ratio of sides is 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n   - The shortest side is opposite to the 30\u00b0 angle\n   - The longest side is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - The shorter leg (opposite to 30\u00b0 angle) measures 5 units\n\n3. Set up the ratio equation:\n   - Let x be the length of the hypotenuse\n   - The ratio of shorter leg to hypotenuse is 1:2\n\n4. Solve for the hypotenuse:\n   - Use the ratio to create an equation\n   - Solve the equation for x\n\n5. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to compute the exact value\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the hypotenuse clearly\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we have made good progress in solving the problem. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We correctly identified that in a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the shorter leg to the hypotenuse is 1:2.\n2. We set up the ratio equation: 5 : x = 1 : 2, where x is the hypotenuse.\n3. We solved this equation by cross-multiplication: 5 * 2 = 1 * x\n4. We calculated 5 * 2 using a calculator and confirmed it equals 10.\n\nOur reasoning so far is correct, and we have effectively found that the hypotenuse is 10 units long. \n\nTo complete our solution and follow the planning strategy, we should:\n\n1. Verify that this result makes sense given the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. We can do this by checking if the longer leg (which should be \u221a3 times the shorter leg) is indeed shorter than the hypotenuse.\n2. Present the final answer clearly.\n\nFor the next step, we should calculate the length of the longer leg to verify our solution. This involves multiplying the shorter leg (5) by \u221a3.\n",
