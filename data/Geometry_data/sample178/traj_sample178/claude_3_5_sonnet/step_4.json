    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving a 30-60-90 Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n   - The ratio of sides is 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n   - The shortest side is opposite to the 30\u00b0 angle\n   - The longest side is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - The shorter leg (opposite to 30\u00b0 angle) measures 5 units\n\n3. Set up the ratio equation:\n   - Let x be the length of the hypotenuse\n   - The ratio of shorter leg to hypotenuse is 1:2\n\n4. Solve for the hypotenuse:\n   - Use the ratio to create an equation\n   - Solve the equation for x\n\n5. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to compute the exact value\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the hypotenuse clearly\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our current progress and the results of our calculations, we can now confidently confirm our solution. Let's review and reason through our findings:\n\n1. We've determined that the hypotenuse is 10 units long.\n2. The shorter leg is given as 5 units.\n3. We calculated the longer leg to be 5\u221a3 \u2248 8.66025403784439 units.\n4. We've verified that the sides follow the correct order: shorter leg (5) < longer leg (8.66...) < hypotenuse (10).\n5. We confirmed that the ratio of the longer leg to the shorter leg is \u221a3 (1.73205080756888).\n6. We've just calculated that the ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg is exactly 2 (10 / 5 = 2.00000000000000).\n\nThese results perfectly align with the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n- The ratio of sides is 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n- The shortest side is opposite to the 30\u00b0 angle (which is our given 5 units)\n- The longest side is the hypotenuse (which we calculated to be 10 units)\n\nThe only remaining verification we could perform is to check if the ratio of the hypotenuse to the longer leg is 2/\u221a3. However, given that all other properties have been confirmed, this step is not strictly necessary.\n\nOur reasoning leads us to conclude that our solution is correct and fully verified. The acting agent can now proceed to present the final answer: The length of the hypotenuse in the given 30-60-90 triangle is 10 units.\n",
