    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving a 30-60-90 Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:\n   - The ratio of sides is 1 : \u221a3 : 2\n   - The shortest side is opposite to the 30\u00b0 angle\n   - The longest side is the hypotenuse\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - The shorter leg (opposite to 30\u00b0 angle) measures 5 units\n\n3. Set up the ratio equation:\n   - Let x be the length of the hypotenuse\n   - The ratio of shorter leg to hypotenuse is 1:2\n\n4. Solve for the hypotenuse:\n   - Use the ratio to create an equation\n   - Solve the equation for x\n\n5. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to compute the exact value\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the length of the hypotenuse clearly\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have a 30-60-90 triangle with the shorter leg measuring 5 units, we can use the known properties of this special right triangle to find the hypotenuse. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the shorter leg (opposite to the 30\u00b0 angle) to the hypotenuse is 1:2.\n\nSince we know the shorter leg is 5 units, we can set up the following ratio equation:\n\n5 : x = 1 : 2\n\nWhere x represents the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nTo solve this, we can use cross multiplication:\n\n5 * 2 = 1 * x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n10 = x\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 units.\n\nThe next step should be to verify this result using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n",
