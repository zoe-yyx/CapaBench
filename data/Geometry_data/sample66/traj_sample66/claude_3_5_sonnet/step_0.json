    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Triangle Side Length Problem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a triangle with sides 7 units, 10 units, and x units\n   - We need to find the maximum integer value for x\n\n2. Recall the Triangle Inequality Theorem:\n   - The sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side\n   - This applies to all three combinations of sides\n\n3. Set up inequalities based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem:\n   - 7 + 10 > x\n   - 7 + x > 10\n   - 10 + x > 7\n\n4. Simplify and solve the inequalities:\n   - x < 17\n   - x > 3\n   - x > -3 (which is always true for positive lengths)\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - 3 < x < 17\n\n6. Determine the maximum integer value:\n   - Since we're looking for the maximum integer value, it would be 16\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if 7, 10, and 16 can form a valid triangle\n   - Use the Triangle Inequality Theorem again for confirmation\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The maximum possible integer value for x is 16\n\nThis plan should guide the team to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit, using basic geometry principles and inequality solving.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem as outlined in the planning strategy. This theorem states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. We have three known pieces of information: two fixed side lengths (7 and 10 units) and one variable side length (x units).\n\nOur next logical step is to set up the inequalities based on this theorem. We need to create three inequalities:\n\n1. 7 + 10 > x\n2. 7 + x > 10\n3. 10 + x > 7\n\nThese inequalities will help us determine the range of possible values for x. Once we have these inequalities, we can solve them to find the constraints on x.\n\nI suggest that the acting agent write down these three inequalities and prepare to solve them in the next step. This will set the foundation for finding the maximum integer value of x.\n",
