    "observation": "In a regular pentagon, each side is 10 units long. What is the length of the diagonal of the pentagon? Give the answer in decimal and round to 2 decimal places",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key information about regular pentagons:\n   - All sides are equal in length\n   - All interior angles are equal\n   - Diagonals connect non-adjacent vertices\n\n2. Identify the formula for the length of a diagonal in a regular pentagon:\n   - The formula is: d = a * (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n   where d is the diagonal length and a is the side length\n\n3. Apply the given information:\n   - Side length (a) = 10 units\n\n4. Calculate the diagonal length:\n   - Substitute a = 10 into the formula\n   - Use a calculator to perform the computation\n\n5. Round the result:\n   - Round the calculated value to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result seems reasonable compared to the side length\n   - Consider using a different method (like trigonometry) to confirm if time allows\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the diagonal length in decimal form, rounded to 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated \u221a5 \u2248 2.23606797749979, we can proceed with the remaining steps of our calculation to find the diagonal length of the regular pentagon.\n\nThe next operations should be:\n\n1. Add 1 to \u221a5:\n   1 + 2.23606797749979\n\n2. Multiply the result by 10:\n   10 * (1 + 2.23606797749979)\n\n3. Divide the entire result by 2:\n   [10 * (1 + 2.23606797749979)] / 2\n\nThis will give us the value of d (diagonal length) according to our formula:\nd = a * (1 + \u221a5) / 2, where a = 10\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we'll have the exact value for the diagonal length. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform these operations in sequence, ensuring accuracy in the computation.\n\nOnce we have the final result, we'll need to round it to 2 decimal places as specified in the original problem.\n",
