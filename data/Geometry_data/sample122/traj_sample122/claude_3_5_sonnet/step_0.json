    "observation": "In a regular pentagon, each side is 10 units long. What is the length of the diagonal of the pentagon? Give the answer in decimal and round to 2 decimal places",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall key information about regular pentagons:\n   - All sides are equal in length\n   - All interior angles are equal\n   - Diagonals connect non-adjacent vertices\n\n2. Identify the formula for the length of a diagonal in a regular pentagon:\n   - The formula is: d = a * (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n   where d is the diagonal length and a is the side length\n\n3. Apply the given information:\n   - Side length (a) = 10 units\n\n4. Calculate the diagonal length:\n   - Substitute a = 10 into the formula\n   - Use a calculator to perform the computation\n\n5. Round the result:\n   - Round the calculated value to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result seems reasonable compared to the side length\n   - Consider using a different method (like trigonometry) to confirm if time allows\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the diagonal length in decimal form, rounded to 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the original problem, our next step should be to focus on the formula for calculating the diagonal length of a regular pentagon. The formula is:\n\nd = a * (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n\nWhere:\nd is the diagonal length\na is the side length\n\nWe know that the side length (a) is 10 units. Now, we need to substitute this value into the formula and perform the calculation. The acting agent should use a calculator to carry out this computation accurately.\n\nThe reasoning for the next operation is as follows:\n\n1. Substitute a = 10 into the formula:\n   d = 10 * (1 + \u221a5) / 2\n\n2. Calculate the value of \u221a5 first, as it's inside the parentheses.\n\n3. Add 1 to the result of \u221a5.\n\n4. Multiply the result by 10.\n\n5. Divide the entire result by 2.\n\n6. Round the final answer to 2 decimal places.\n\nThis sequence of calculations will give us the length of the diagonal of the regular pentagon with side length 10 units.\n",
