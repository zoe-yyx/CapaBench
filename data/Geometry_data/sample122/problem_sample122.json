    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Using the formula for the length of a diagonal in a regular pentagon, which is $d = s(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$, where $s$ is the side length. Substituting $s = 10$, we get $d = 10 \\times (1+\\sqrt{5})/2 = 10 \\times 1.618 = 16.18$ units. \\(\\boxed{16.18}\\)",
