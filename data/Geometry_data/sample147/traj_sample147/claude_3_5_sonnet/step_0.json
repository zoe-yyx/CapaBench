    "observation": "A hexagon is rotated clockwise around its center. What is the minimum number of degrees it must be rotated until it looks the same as its original position?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the properties of a hexagon:\n   - A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 vertices\n   - It has rotational symmetry\n\n2. Consider the concept of rotational symmetry:\n   - Rotational symmetry occurs when a shape looks the same after a certain amount of rotation\n   - The number of times a shape looks the same in a full 360\u00b0 rotation is its order of rotational symmetry\n\n3. Determine the order of rotational symmetry for a hexagon:\n   - A hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry\n\n4. Calculate the minimum rotation angle:\n   - Divide 360\u00b0 by the order of rotational symmetry\n   - 360\u00b0 \u00f7 6 = 60\u00b0\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Confirm that a 60\u00b0 rotation brings the hexagon back to a position indistinguishable from its original orientation\n\n6. State the final answer:\n   - The minimum number of degrees a hexagon must be rotated clockwise to look the same as its original position is 60\u00b0\n\n7. (Optional) Extend understanding:\n   - Consider how this relates to other regular polygons\n   - Discuss the relationship between the number of sides and the minimum rotation angle\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to focus on the rotational symmetry of a hexagon. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 vertices, which gives it 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n2. Rotational symmetry means the shape looks the same after a certain amount of rotation.\n3. To find the minimum rotation, we need to divide a full rotation (360\u00b0) by the order of rotational symmetry.\n\nGiven this information, the next logical step would be to perform the calculation:\n360\u00b0 \u00f7 6 = 60\u00b0\n\nThis calculation will give us the minimum number of degrees the hexagon must be rotated to look the same as its original position. The acting agent should use a calculator to confirm this division.\n\nAfter the calculation, we should verify that a 60\u00b0 rotation indeed brings the hexagon back to a position indistinguishable from its original orientation. This can be done by visualizing or drawing the rotation.\n",
