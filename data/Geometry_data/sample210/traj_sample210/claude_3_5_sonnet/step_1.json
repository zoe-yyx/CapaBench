    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - One of the angles is \u03b2\n   - cos(\u03b2) = 12/13\n\n2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find sin(\u03b2):\n   - In a right triangle, cos\u00b2(\u03b2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b2) = 1\n   - Calculate sin(\u03b2) using this relationship\n\n3. Recall the double angle formula for sin(2\u03b2):\n   - sin(2\u03b2) = 2sin(\u03b2)cos(\u03b2)\n\n4. Apply the double angle formula:\n   - Substitute the values of sin(\u03b2) and cos(\u03b2) into the formula\n\n5. Simplify and calculate the final result for sin(2\u03b2)\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense (should be between -1 and 1)\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the result\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical action and our planning strategy, we've made good progress. We've calculated 1 - (12/13)^2, which equals 0.147928994082840. This value represents sin\u00b2(\u03b2).\n\nNow, we need to continue with the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate sin(\u03b2) by taking the square root of 0.147928994082840.\n2. We already know cos(\u03b2) = 12/13.\n3. Use these values in the double angle formula: sin(2\u03b2) = 2sin(\u03b2)cos(\u03b2).\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate sin(\u03b2) by taking the square root of 0.147928994082840. This will give us the value we need to plug into the double angle formula along with cos(\u03b2) = 12/13.\n\nTherefore, we should instruct the acting agent to use a calculator to find the square root of 0.147928994082840.
