    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - One of the angles is \u03b2\n   - cos(\u03b2) = 12/13\n\n2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find sin(\u03b2):\n   - In a right triangle, cos\u00b2(\u03b2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b2) = 1\n   - Calculate sin(\u03b2) using this relationship\n\n3. Recall the double angle formula for sin(2\u03b2):\n   - sin(2\u03b2) = 2sin(\u03b2)cos(\u03b2)\n\n4. Apply the double angle formula:\n   - Substitute the values of sin(\u03b2) and cos(\u03b2) into the formula\n\n5. Simplify and calculate the final result for sin(2\u03b2)\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense (should be between -1 and 1)\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the result\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and our previous work, we need to adjust our approach to provide the exact answer rather than a decimal approximation.

We calculated sin\u00b2(\u03b2) = 1 - cos\u00b2(\u03b2) = 1 - (12/13)\u00b2 = 25/169\n\n3. Therefore, sin(\u03b2) = \u221a(25/169) = 5/13 (this is the exact form of 0.384615384615384)\n\n4. We need to apply the double angle formula: sin(2\u03b2) = 2sin(\u03b2)cos(\u03b2)\n\n5. Substituting the exact values:\n   sin(2\u03b2) = 2 * (5/13) * (12/13)\n\n6. Simplifying:\n   sin(2\u03b2) = (2 * 5 * 12) / (13 * 13) = 120/169\n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to perform this simplification to arrive at the exact fraction 120/169. This will give us the correct, exact answer in the form expected for trigonometric problems.\n\nTherefore, we should instruct the acting agent to simplify the expression:\n\n2 * (5/13) * (12/13)\n\nThis will lead us to the final, correct answer of sin(2\u03b2) = 120/169.\n",
