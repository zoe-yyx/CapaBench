    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - One of the angles is \u03b2\n   - cos(\u03b2) = 12/13\n\n2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find sin(\u03b2):\n   - In a right triangle, cos\u00b2(\u03b2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b2) = 1\n   - Calculate sin(\u03b2) using this relationship\n\n3. Recall the double angle formula for sin(2\u03b2):\n   - sin(2\u03b2) = 2sin(\u03b2)cos(\u03b2)\n\n4. Apply the double angle formula:\n   - Substitute the values of sin(\u03b2) and cos(\u03b2) into the formula\n\n5. Simplify and calculate the final result for sin(2\u03b2)\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense (should be between -1 and 1)\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the result\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these logical steps:\n\n1. We're given that cos(\u03b2) = 12/13 in a right triangle. This is our starting point.\n\n2. To find sin(2\u03b2), we'll need to use the double angle formula: sin(2\u03b2) = 2sin(\u03b2)cos(\u03b2). We already know cos(\u03b2), but we need to find sin(\u03b2).\n\n3.

Let's rearrange the Pythagorean identity to solve for sin(\u03b2):\n   sin\u00b2(\u03b2) = 1 - cos\u00b2(\u03b2)\n   sin\u00b2(\u03b2) = 1 - (12/13)\u00b2\n\n5.

Once we have sin(\u03b2), we can plug both sin(\u03b2) and cos(\u03b2) into the double angle formula to calculate sin(2\u03b2).\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to calculate (12/13)\u00b2 and then subtract it from 1.
