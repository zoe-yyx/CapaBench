    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components:\n   - Triangle with sides 13, 14, and 15\n   - Inscribed circle\n   - Goal: Calculate the radius of the inscribed circle\n\n2. Recall the formula for the radius of an inscribed circle:\n   r = A / s, where:\n   r = radius of inscribed circle\n   A = area of the triangle\n   s = semi-perimeter of the triangle\n\n3. Calculate the semi-perimeter (s):\n   s = (a + b + c) / 2, where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle\n\n4. Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n   A = \u221a[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]\n\n5. Apply the radius formula:\n   r = A / s\n\n6. Perform necessary calculations:\n   - Calculate semi-perimeter\n   - Calculate area using Heron's formula\n   - Calculate radius using the formula r = A / s\n\n7. Round the final answer to an appropriate number of decimal places\n\n8. Verify the result by checking if it makes sense within the context of the triangle's dimensions\n",

This formula uses the semi-perimeter we just calculated and the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\nHeron's formula states that the area (A) of a triangle is:\nA = \u221a[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]\n\nWhere:\ns = semi-perimeter (which we calculated as 21)\na, b, c = sides of the triangle (13, 14, and 15)\n\nTo proceed, we need to:\n1. Calculate the values inside the square root: s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)\n2. Take the square root of that result\n\nThis calculation will give us the area of the triangle, which is essential for determining the radius of the inscribed circle in the next step.\n\nTherefore, our next action should be to use a calculator to perform this calculation.\n",
