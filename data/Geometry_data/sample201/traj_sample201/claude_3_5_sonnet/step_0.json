    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components:\n   - Triangle with sides 13, 14, and 15\n   - Inscribed circle\n   - Goal: Calculate the radius of the inscribed circle\n\n2. Recall the formula for the radius of an inscribed circle:\n   r = A / s, where:\n   r = radius of inscribed circle\n   A = area of the triangle\n   s = semi-perimeter of the triangle\n\n3. Calculate the semi-perimeter (s):\n   s = (a + b + c) / 2, where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle\n\n4. Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n   A = \u221a[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]\n\n5. Apply the radius formula:\n   r = A / s\n\n6. Perform necessary calculations:\n   - Calculate semi-perimeter\n   - Calculate area using Heron's formula\n   - Calculate radius using the formula r = A / s\n\n7. Round the final answer to an appropriate number of decimal places\n\n8. Verify the result by checking if it makes sense within the context of the triangle's dimensions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the planning strategy. Let's start with calculating the semi-perimeter of the triangle, as it's the first step in both finding the area and the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe semi-perimeter (s) is given by the formula:\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\nWhere a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle: 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWe should calculate this value first, as it will be used in subsequent steps. After that, we can proceed to calculate the area using Heron's formula.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle using the given side lengths.\n",
