    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components:\n   - Triangle with sides 13, 14, and 15\n   - Inscribed circle\n   - Goal: Calculate the radius of the inscribed circle\n\n2. Recall the formula for the radius of an inscribed circle:\n   r = A / s, where:\n   r = radius of inscribed circle\n   A = area of the triangle\n   s = semi-perimeter of the triangle\n\n3. Calculate the semi-perimeter (s):\n   s = (a + b + c) / 2, where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle\n\n4. Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula:\n   A = \u221a[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]\n\n5. Apply the radius formula:\n   r = A / s\n\n6. Perform necessary calculations:\n   - Calculate semi-perimeter\n   - Calculate area using Heron's formula\n   - Calculate radius using the formula r = A / s\n\n7. Round the final answer to an appropriate number of decimal places\n\n8. Verify the result by checking if it makes sense within the context of the triangle's dimensions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated both the semi-perimeter (s = 21) and the area of the triangle (A = 84), we can proceed to the final step of our problem-solving strategy: calculating the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nWe recall from our planning that the formula for the radius of an inscribed circle is:\n\nr = A / s\n\nWhere:\nr = radius of the inscribed circle\nA = area of the triangle (which we calculated as 84)\ns = semi-perimeter of the triangle (which we calculated as 21)\n\nOur next logical step is to apply this formula using the values we have obtained. This will give us the radius of the inscribed circle, which is the final answer to our problem.\n\nTherefore, we should use a calculator to divide the area by the semi-perimeter:\n\nr = 84 / 21\n\nThis calculation will give us the radius of the inscribed circle. After obtaining this result, we should consider rounding it to an appropriate number of decimal places for a final, practical answer.\n",
