    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Right Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify the known information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - One leg measures 5 units\n   - The hypotenuse measures 13 units\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the legs\n\n3. Set up the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n   - 5\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 13\u00b2, where x is the unknown leg\n\n4. Simplify the known values:\n   - 25 + x\u00b2 = 169\n\n5. Isolate x\u00b2:\n   - x\u00b2 = 169 - 25\n   - x\u00b2 = 144\n\n6. Calculate the square root of both sides:\n   - x = \u221a144\n\n7. Simplify the square root:\n   - x = 12\n\n8. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - The length of the other leg is 12 units\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider alternative methods if time allows.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the Pythagorean theorem. We know one leg is 5 units and the hypotenuse is 13 units.

We should use a calculator to compute:\n\n1. 5\u00b2 (5 squared)\n2. 13\u00b2 (13 squared)\n\nThese calculations will allow us to simplify our equation and move forward with solving for x.\n",
