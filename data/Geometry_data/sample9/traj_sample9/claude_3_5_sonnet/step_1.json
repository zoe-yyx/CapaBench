Remember the special right triangle:\n   - 45-45-90 triangle is isosceles and has specific properties.\n\n3. Utilize the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle:\n   - The sides of this triangle have a ratio of 1 : 1 : \u221a2.\n\n4. Apply the definition of cosine in a right triangle:\n   - Cosine is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.\n\n5. Set up the cosine ratio:\n   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, both legs are equal and the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the leg length.\n\n6.

Present the final answer:\n   - Express cos 45\u00b0 in its exact form.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct calculation of cos 45\u00b0 within the given 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometric knowledge and properties of special right triangles.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action taken, we can now reason about the next step in computing cos 45\u00b0. \n\nWe've already expressed cos 45\u00b0 as a ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a 45-45-90 triangle. Now, we need to recall the specific properties of a 45-45-90 triangle to determine these side lengths.\n\nIn a 45-45-90 triangle:\n1. The two legs (sides adjacent to the right angle) are equal in length.\n2. If we assume each leg has a length of 1 unit, then the hypotenuse will have a length of \u221a2 units.\n\nThis is because in a 45-45-90 triangle, the ratio of a leg to the hypotenuse is 1 : \u221a2.\n\nTherefore, we can now set up the cosine ratio as:\n\ncos 45\u00b0 = adjacent side / hypotenuse = 1 / \u221a2\n\nThis fraction 1/\u221a2 is our next step in the computation. However, it's often preferred to rationalize the denominator to get a more standard form.\n\nThe next logical step would be to rationalize this fraction, which will give us the final, simplified form of cos 45\u00b0.\n",
