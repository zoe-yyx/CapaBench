Remember the special right triangle:\n   - 45-45-90 triangle is isosceles and has specific properties.\n\n3. Utilize the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle:\n   - The sides of this triangle have a ratio of 1 : 1 : \u221a2.\n\n4. Apply the definition of cosine in a right triangle:\n   - Cosine is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.\n\n5. Set up the cosine ratio:\n   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, both legs are equal and the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the leg length.\n\n6. Simplify the ratio:\n   - Express the cosine value in its simplest form.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Cross-check with known trigonometric values or use a calculator if necessary.\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - Express cos 45\u00b0 in its exact form.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct calculation of cos 45\u00b0 within the given 10-round limit, utilizing basic trigonometric knowledge and properties of special right triangles.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions taken, we can reason about the next step in computing cos 45\u00b0:\n\n1. We've correctly identified that cos 45\u00b0 can be expressed as a ratio in a 45-45-90 triangle.\n2. We've also rationalized the fraction 1/\u221a2 by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a2.\n\nThe next logical step in our reasoning process should be:\n\n3. Simplify the rationalized fraction. When we multiply 1/\u221a2 by \u221a2/\u221a2, we get (1 * \u221a2) / (\u221a2 * \u221a2) = \u221a2 / 2.\n\nThis simplification will lead us to the final, simplified form of cos 45\u00b0. The acting agent should focus on performing this simplification step to arrive at the standard representation of cos 45\u00b0.\n\nAfter this step, we should be ready to present the final answer in its exact form, which aligns with step 8 of our original planning strategy.\n",
