    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Right Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - The triangle is a right triangle\n   - The hypotenuse is 13 units long\n   - One leg is 12 units long\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   where c is the hypotenuse, and a and b are the legs\n\n3. Set up the Pythagorean equation:\n   12\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n   where x is the unknown leg\n\n4. Simplify the known values:\n   144 + x\u00b2 = 169\n\n5. Isolate x\u00b2:\n   x\u00b2 = 169 - 144\n\n6. Calculate the value of x\u00b2:\n   x\u00b2 = 25\n\n7. Take the square root of both sides:\n   x = \u221a25\n\n8. Simplify the final answer:\n   x = 5\n\n9. Verify the solution using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   12\u00b2 + 5\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n\n10. Present the final answer: The length of the other leg is 5 units.\n\nThis plan should allow the following agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit, using basic arithmetic operations and the Pythagorean theorem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should start by setting up the Pythagorean theorem equation. We know that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. We have the following information:\n\n- The hypotenuse is 13 units long\n- One leg is 12 units long\n- We need to find the length of the other leg, let's call it x\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n12\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\n\nThe next step would be to simplify the known values. We need to calculate 12\u00b2 and 13\u00b2. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations:\n\n1. Calculate 12\u00b2\n2. Calculate 13\u00b2\n\nOnce we have these values, we can substitute them into our equation and proceed with solving for x.\n",
