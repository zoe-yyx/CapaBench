    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Point A is at (-2, -3)\n   - Point B is at (4, 5)\n   - We need to construct a square ABCD\n   - Points C and D are in the fourth quadrant\n\n2. Calculate the length and slope of line segment AB:\n   - Use the distance formula to find the length of AB\n   - Calculate the slope of AB\n\n3. Determine the coordinates of point C:\n   - Use the fact that AB is a diagonal of the square\n   - Rotate AB by 90 degrees clockwise to find the direction of BC\n   - Use the length of AB to find the coordinates of C\n\n4. Determine the coordinates of point D:\n   - D will complete the square\n   - It can be found by translating A by the same vector as B to C\n\n5. Verify that C and D are in the fourth quadrant\n\n6. Find the midpoint of CD:\n   - Calculate the average of the x-coordinates of C and D\n   - Calculate the average of the y-coordinates of C and D\n\n7. Extract the abscissa (x-coordinate) of the midpoint of CD\n\n8. Double-check all calculations and reasoning\n\n9. Present the final answer: the abscissa of the midpoint of CD\n",

We've just calculated dx, which is 8.00000000000000.\n\nNow, we need to continue with the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate dy:\n   dy = -0.75 * dx = -0.75 * 8.00000000000000\n\n2. Find the coordinates of point C:\n   C_x = B_x + dx = 4 + 8.00000000000000\n   C_y = B_y + dy = 5 + (-0.75 * 8.00000000000000)\n\n3.
