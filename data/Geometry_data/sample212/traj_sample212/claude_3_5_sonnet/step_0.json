Calculate the length and slope of line segment AB:\n   - Use the distance formula to find the length of AB\n   - Calculate the slope of AB\n\n3. Determine the coordinates of point C:\n   - Use the fact that AB is a diagonal of the square\n   - Rotate AB by 90 degrees clockwise to find the direction of BC\n   - Use the length of AB to find the coordinates of C\n\n4. Determine the coordinates of point D:\n   - D will complete the square\n   - It can be found by translating A by the same vector as B to C\n\n5. Verify that C and D are in the fourth quadrant\n\n6. Find the midpoint of CD:\n   - Calculate the average of the x-coordinates of C and D\n   - Calculate the average of the y-coordinates of C and D\n\n7.

Calculate the length of AB:\n   We can use the distance formula: d = \u221a[(x\u2082-x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082-y\u2081)\u00b2]\n   Where (x\u2081,y\u2081) = (-2,-3) and (x\u2082,y\u2082) = (4,5)\n\n2. Calculate the slope of AB:\n   We can use the slope formula: m = (y\u2082-y\u2081)/(x\u2082-x\u2081)\n\nThese calculations will give us the essential information about the diagonal AB of our square.
