    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Point P: (3,4)\n   - Point Q: (3,10)\n   - Point R: (9,4)\n\n2. Recognize that we have a right-angled triangle:\n   - PQ is vertical (same x-coordinate)\n   - PR is horizontal (same y-coordinate)\n   - QR is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Calculate the lengths of the two perpendicular sides:\n   - Length of PQ = |y2 - y1| = |10 - 4| = 6\n   - Length of PR = |x2 - x1| = |9 - 3| = 6\n\n4. Apply the formula for the area of a triangle:\n   Area = (1/2) * base * height\n\n5. Substitute the values and calculate:\n   Area = (1/2) * 6 * 6 = 18\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculation is correct\n   - Ensure the units are square units\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The area of triangle PQR is 18 square units.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have verified the coordinates of points P(3,4), Q(3,10), and R(9,4), we can now proceed with analyzing the shape of the triangle. \n\nThe next logical step is to confirm that we indeed have a right-angled triangle. We can do this by observing the following:\n\n1. PQ is vertical because both P and Q have the same x-coordinate (3).\n2. PR is horizontal because both P and R have the same y-coordinate (4).\n3. QR forms the hypotenuse of this right-angled triangle.\n\nConfirming this right-angled structure is crucial because it simplifies our area calculation. In a right-angled triangle, we can use the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.\n\nOnce we've confirmed the right-angled nature of the triangle, we should proceed to calculate the lengths of PQ and PR, which will serve as the base and height for our area calculation.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on confirming the right-angled nature of the triangle and then calculate the lengths of PQ and PR.\n",
