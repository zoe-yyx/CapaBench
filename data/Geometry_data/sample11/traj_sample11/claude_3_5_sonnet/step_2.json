    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Point P: (3,4)\n   - Point Q: (3,10)\n   - Point R: (9,4)\n\n2. Recognize that we have a right-angled triangle:\n   - PQ is vertical (same x-coordinate)\n   - PR is horizontal (same y-coordinate)\n   - QR is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Calculate the lengths of the two perpendicular sides:\n   - Length of PQ = |y2 - y1| = |10 - 4| = 6\n   - Length of PR = |x2 - x1| = |9 - 3| = 6\n\n4. Apply the formula for the area of a triangle:\n   Area = (1/2) * base * height\n\n5. Substitute the values and calculate:\n   Area = (1/2) * 6 * 6 = 18\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculation is correct\n   - Ensure the units are square units\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The area of triangle PQR is 18 square units.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have confirmed the coordinates of the points and verified that we indeed have a right-angled triangle, we can proceed with calculating the area. We know that for a right-angled triangle, the area can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nWe have already determined that both PQ and PR have a length of 6 units. Either of these can serve as the base, with the other serving as the height. \n\nThe next logical step is to apply this formula using the lengths we've calculated. We should guide the acting agent to perform this calculation:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 6 * 6\n\nThis calculation will give us the final area of the triangle PQR.\n",
