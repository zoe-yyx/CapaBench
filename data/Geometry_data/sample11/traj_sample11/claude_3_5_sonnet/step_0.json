    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Point P: (3,4)\n   - Point Q: (3,10)\n   - Point R: (9,4)\n\n2. Recognize that we have a right-angled triangle:\n   - PQ is vertical (same x-coordinate)\n   - PR is horizontal (same y-coordinate)\n   - QR is the hypotenuse\n\n3. Calculate the lengths of the two perpendicular sides:\n   - Length of PQ = |y2 - y1| = |10 - 4| = 6\n   - Length of PR = |x2 - x1| = |9 - 3| = 6\n\n4. Apply the formula for the area of a triangle:\n   Area = (1/2) * base * height\n\n5. Substitute the values and calculate:\n   Area = (1/2) * 6 * 6 = 18\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculation is correct\n   - Ensure the units are square units\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The area of triangle PQR is 18 square units.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by confirming that we indeed have a right-angled triangle. This is a crucial step because it determines our approach to calculating the area.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to verify the coordinates of the points:\n1. Confirm that points P and Q have the same x-coordinate (3), forming a vertical line.\n2. Confirm that points P and R have the same y-coordinate (4), forming a horizontal line.\n\nThis verification will ensure that we have a right angle at point P, which is essential for using the simple area formula for a right triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height.\n\nOnce this is confirmed, we can proceed to calculate the lengths of PQ and PR, which will serve as the height and base of our triangle respectively.\n",
