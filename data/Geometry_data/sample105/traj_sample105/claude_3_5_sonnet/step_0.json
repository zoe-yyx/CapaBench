    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we should start by calculating the circumference of the circle. This will give us the total length of the circle, which we can then divide into three equal parts.\n\nTo calculate the circumference, we need to use the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius of the circle. We're given that the radius is 7 units.\n\nThe next logical step is to guide the acting agent to use a calculator to perform this calculation. We need to multiply 2 by \u03c0 and then by 7.\n\nAfter calculating the circumference, we'll need to divide it by 3 to find the length of each arc, as the circle is divided into three equal parts.\n\nSo, let's guide the acting agent to:\n1. Calculate 2 * \u03c0 * 7 to find the circumference\n2. Divide the result by 3 to find the length of each arc\n\nThis reasoning will allow us to directly solve for the required arc length.\n",
