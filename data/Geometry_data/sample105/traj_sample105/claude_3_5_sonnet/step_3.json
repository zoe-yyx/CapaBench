    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our planning strategy, we have successfully calculated the length of each arc and rounded it to two decimal places. The result we obtained is rounded(36651914291881/2500000000000, 2).\n\nTo complete our solution and ensure its accuracy, we need to take two final steps:\n\n1. Interpret the rounded result: The calculator has given us a fraction, which we need to convert to a decimal for easier interpretation. We should guide the acting agent to perform this conversion.\n\n2. Verify the solution: As mentioned in our planning strategy, we should check if multiplying our rounded arc length by 3 gives us back the original circumference (or a very close approximation, considering we rounded our result).\n\nTherefore, our next steps should be:\n\n1. Convert the fraction 36651914291881/2500000000000 to a decimal, rounded to two decimal places.\n2. Multiply this result by 3 and compare it to our original circumference calculation of 43.9822971502571.\n\nThese steps will allow us to present a clear, final answer and verify its correctness, completing our problem-solving process.\n",
