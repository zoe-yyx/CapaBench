    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the planning strategy, we have successfully completed the main calculations required to solve this problem. Let's review what we've done and determine the next steps:\n\n1. We calculated the circumference of the circle using C = 2\u03c0r, where r = 7. The result was 43.9822971502571 units.\n2. We then divided this circumference by 3 to find the length of each arc, resulting in 14.6607657167524 units.\n\nAt this point, we have effectively solved the problem. The length of each arc is 14.6607657167524 units. However, there are a couple of final steps we should consider:\n\n1. Rounding: In practical applications, it's often appropriate to round the result to a reasonable number of decimal places. For most geometric problems, rounding to two or three decimal places is usually sufficient.\n\n2. Verification: As mentioned in our planning strategy, it's a good practice to verify our solution by checking if multiplying our arc length by 3 gives us back the original circumference.\n\nTherefore, I suggest guiding the acting agent to:\n\n1. Round our result to two decimal places for a final, practical answer.\n2. Perform a verification calculation by multiplying our rounded arc length by 3 and comparing it to the original circumference.\n\nThese steps will complete our solution process and ensure the accuracy of our work.\n",
