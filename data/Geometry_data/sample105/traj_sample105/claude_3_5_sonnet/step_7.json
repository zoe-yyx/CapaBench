    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the reflection information. You're absolutely correct, and I apologize for the oversight in my previous reasoning. Let's adjust our approach to provide a more mathematically precise answer.\n\nGiven:\n- The circle has a radius of 7 units\n- The circle is divided into three equal arcs\n\nReasoning:\n1. The circumference of the circle is 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(7) = 14\u03c0 units.\n\n2. Since the circle is divided into three equal arcs, the length of each arc is:\n   (14\u03c0 / 3) units\n\n3. This expression, (14\u03c0 / 3) units, is the most accurate and mathematically precise way to represent the answer. It avoids any loss of precision that comes with decimal approximations.\n\n4. If a decimal approximation is required, we should provide it alongside the exact expression, clearly stating that it's an approximation.\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Express the final answer as (14\u03c0 / 3) units.\n2. If a decimal approximation is needed, calculate it to a specified number of decimal places (e.g., 4 or 5) and present it alongside the exact expression.\n3. Explain that the exact expression maintains mathematical precision, especially in problems involving \u03c0.\n\nThis approach provides a mathematically rigorous solution while also accommodating practical needs if a decimal approximation is required.\n",
