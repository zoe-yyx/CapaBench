    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our planning strategy, we have successfully calculated and rounded the length of each arc. Let's analyze our current progress:\n\n1. We calculated the circumference: 43.9822971502571 units\n2. We divided it by 3 to get the arc length: 14.6607657167524 units\n3. We attempted to round this to two decimal places, but the calculator returned a fraction\n\nNow, we need to interpret this fraction and complete our verification step. Here's the reasoning for our next actions:\n\n1. Interpret the rounded result:\n   The fraction 36651914291881/2500000000000 is actually the exact representation of 14.6607657167524. When we asked to round it to two decimal places, the calculator maintained precision. We need to manually round this to two decimal places.\n\n2. Verify the solution:\n   After rounding, we should multiply our result by 3 to check if it matches (or is very close to) our original circumference calculation.\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Manually round 14.6607657167524 to two decimal places.\n2. Multiply this rounded value by 3.\n3. Compare the result with our original circumference (43.9822971502571).\n\nThis will allow us to present a final, rounded answer and verify its correctness, completing our problem-solving process.\n",
