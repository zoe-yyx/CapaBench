    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our planning strategy, we've encountered a persistent issue with rounding using the calculator. Let's adjust our approach:\n\n1. Manual Rounding:\n   We know the exact value is 14.6607657167524. To round this to two decimal places manually:\n   - The third decimal place is 0, so we round down.\n   - This gives us 14.66 as our rounded value.\n\n2. Verification:\n   Now that we have our rounded value, we need to verify our solution by:\n   a) Multiplying 14.66 by 3 to check if it's close to our original circumference.\n   b) Comparing this result with our calculated circumference of 43.9822971502571.\n\n3. Final Answer Formulation:\n   After verification, we'll formulate our final answer, stating the length of each arc rounded to two decimal places.\n\nTherefore, our next steps should be:\n\n1. Guide the acting agent to multiply 14.66 by 3.\n2. Compare this result with our original circumference calculation.\n3. Formulate the final answer based on these calculations.\n\nThis approach will allow us to overcome the rounding issue and complete our problem-solving process accurately.\n",
