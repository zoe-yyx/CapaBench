    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection information and our previous steps, we need to revise our approach to provide a more precise answer. Let's reconsider our solution:\n\n1. We correctly calculated the circumference of the circle: 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0 * 7 = 14\u03c0 units.\n\n2. We then divided this by 3 to get the length of each arc: 14\u03c0 / 3 = (14/3)\u03c0 units.\n\nOur mistake was in prematurely rounding this result to a decimal approximation. For mathematical precision, especially in geometry problems, it's often better to leave the answer in terms of \u03c0 when possible.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning for the next step should be:\n\n1. Express the arc length as an exact fraction of \u03c0: (14/3)\u03c0 units.\n2. If a decimal approximation is needed, we can calculate it, but we should keep the exact form as our primary answer.\n3. Verify that this expression, when multiplied by 3, indeed gives us the full circumference of 14\u03c0.\n\nThis approach maintains mathematical accuracy and avoids the loss of precision that comes with decimal approximations. It also aligns better with typical expectations in geometric problem-solving, where expressions involving \u03c0 are often preferred over decimal approximations.\n",
