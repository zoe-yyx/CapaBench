    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The circle is divided into 3 equal arcs\n   - Points A, B, and C divide the circle\n   - The radius of the circle is 7 units\n\n2. Recall key concepts:\n   - The formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2\u03c0r\n   - The relationship between the full circle (360\u00b0) and its equal parts\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the circle:\n   - Use the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7\n\n4. Divide the circumference by 3:\n   - Since the circle is divided into 3 equal arcs, divide the total circumference by 3\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   - The length of each arc will be the result from step 4\n\n6. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the required precision, round the final answer appropriately\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if multiplying the arc length by 3 gives the total circumference\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the planning strategy, we have successfully calculated the circumference of the circle using the formula C = 2\u03c0r with r = 7. The result we obtained is 43.9822971502571 units.\n\nNow, we need to move to the next step in our plan, which is to divide this circumference into three equal parts to find the length of each arc. Since the circle is divided into three equal arcs by points A, B, and C, we need to divide the total circumference by 3.\n\nTherefore, our next logical step is to guide the acting agent to use the calculator again to perform this division:\n\n1. Take the circumference we calculated (43.9822971502571)\n2. Divide it by 3\n\nThis operation will give us the length of each arc, which is the final answer we're looking for in this problem.\n\nAfter this calculation, we may need to consider rounding the result to an appropriate number of decimal places, depending on the level of precision required. However, we'll make that decision after seeing the result of the division.\n",
