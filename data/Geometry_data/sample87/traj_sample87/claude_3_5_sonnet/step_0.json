    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rectangle Area Ratio Problem:\n\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Draw a mental image of rectangle ABCD with point E on side AB.\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - Rectangle dimensions: AB = 8 units, BC = 6 units\n   - Point E location: AE = 2 units\n\n3. Calculate the area of rectangle ABCD:\n   - Use the formula: Area of rectangle = length \u00d7 width\n   - Area ABCD = AB \u00d7 BC = 8 \u00d7 6\n\n4. Determine the height of triangle AEC:\n   - Recognize that the height of triangle AEC is the same as BC (6 units)\n\n5. Calculate the base of triangle AEC:\n   - Base of AEC = AE = 2 units\n\n6. Calculate the area of triangle AEC:\n   - Use the formula: Area of triangle = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\n   - Area AEC = (1/2) \u00d7 AE \u00d7 BC\n\n7. Set up the ratio:\n   - Ratio = Area of triangle AEC : Area of rectangle ABCD\n\n8. Simplify the ratio:\n   - Substitute the calculated values\n   - Simplify if possible\n\n9. Express the final answer as a simplified fraction or decimal\n\n10. Double-check calculations and reasoning\n",
