    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rectangle Area Ratio Problem:\n\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Draw a mental image of rectangle ABCD with point E on side AB.\n\n2. Identify known information:\n   - Rectangle dimensions: AB = 8 units, BC = 6 units\n   - Point E location: AE = 2 units\n\n3. Calculate the area of rectangle ABCD:\n   - Use the formula: Area of rectangle = length \u00d7 width\n   - Area ABCD = AB \u00d7 BC = 8 \u00d7 6\n\n4. Determine the height of triangle AEC:\n   - Recognize that the height of triangle AEC is the same as BC (6 units)\n\n5. Calculate the base of triangle AEC:\n   - Base of AEC = AE = 2 units\n\n6. Calculate the area of triangle AEC:\n   - Use the formula: Area of triangle = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\n   - Area AEC = (1/2) \u00d7 AE \u00d7 BC\n\n7. Set up the ratio:\n   - Ratio = Area of triangle AEC : Area of rectangle ABCD\n\n8. Simplify the ratio:\n   - Substitute the calculated values\n   - Simplify if possible\n\n9. Express the final answer as a simplified fraction or decimal\n\n10. Double-check calculations and reasoning\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress so far, we have successfully calculated two crucial pieces of information:\n\n1. The area of rectangle ABCD = 48 square units\n2. The area of triangle AEC = 6 square units\n\nNow that we have both these areas, we can proceed to set up the ratio as per our strategic plan. The ratio we're looking for is:\n\nArea of triangle AEC : Area of rectangle ABCD\n\nWe can express this as a fraction:\n\n(Area of triangle AEC) / (Area of rectangle ABCD)\n\nSubstituting our calculated values:\n\n6 / 48\n\nOur next step should be to simplify this fraction to its lowest terms. This will give us the final answer to our problem in the most concise form. To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6 and 48, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by this GCD.\n\nLet's proceed with simplifying this fraction 6/48 to its lowest terms.\n",
