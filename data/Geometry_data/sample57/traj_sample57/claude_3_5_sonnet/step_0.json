Recall trigonometric angle relationships:\n   - 150\u00b0 is in the second quadrant of the unit circle\n   - 150\u00b0 can be related to 30\u00b0 (which is a common angle)\n\n2. Use the supplementary angle formula:\n   sin(180\u00b0 - \u03b8) = sin \u03b8\n   150\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 30\u00b0\n\n3. Recall the value of sin 30\u00b0:\n   sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n4. Apply the supplementary angle formula:\n   sin 150\u00b0 = sin(180\u00b0 - 30\u00b0) = sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if 1/2 is a reasonable value for sin 150\u00b0\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   sin 150\u00b0 = 1/2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy, we should start by focusing on the relationship between 150\u00b0 and 30\u00b0, as this is key to solving the problem efficiently.\n\n1. We need to recognize that 150\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 are supplementary angles (they add up to 180\u00b0). This relationship is crucial because it allows us to use the supplementary angle formula for sine.\n\n2. The supplementary angle formula states that sin(180\u00b0 - \u03b8) = sin \u03b8. In our case, 150\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 30\u00b0, which means sin 150\u00b0 = sin 30\u00b0.\n\n3. Now, we need to recall the value of sin 30\u00b0. This is a common angle in trigonometry, and its sine value should be known or easily looked up.\n\n4. Once we have the value of sin 30\u00b0, we can directly state that this is equal to sin 150\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step for the acting agent should be to either recall or look up the value of sin 30\u00b0. This value is a fundamental trigonometric ratio that should be readily available.\n",
