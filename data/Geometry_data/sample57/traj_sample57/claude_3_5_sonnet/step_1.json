Recall trigonometric angle relationships:\n   - 150\u00b0 is in the second quadrant of the unit circle\n   - 150\u00b0 can be related to 30\u00b0 (which is a common angle)\n\n2. Use the supplementary angle formula:\n   sin(180\u00b0 - \u03b8) = sin \u03b8\n   150\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 30\u00b0\n\n3. Recall the value of sin 30\u00b0:\n   sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n4. Apply the supplementary angle formula:\n   sin 150\u00b0 = sin(180\u00b0 - 30\u00b0) = sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if 1/2 is a reasonable value for sin 150\u00b0\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   sin 150\u00b0 = 1/2\n",

We've used a calculator to compute sin(\u03c0/6), which is equivalent to sin 30\u00b0, and obtained the result 0.5.\n\nNow, we can reason about the next steps:\n\n1. The calculator result confirms our planning strategy's assertion that sin 30\u00b0 = 1/2.\n2. Since we've established that sin 150\u00b0 = sin 30\u00b0, and we now know the value of sin 30\u00b0, we can directly conclude that sin 150\u00b0 = 1/2.\n\nAt this point, we have effectively solved the problem. The next logical step would be to formally state our conclusion and potentially verify it for completeness.\n\nThe acting agent should now focus on:\n1. Explicitly stating the final answer: sin 150\u00b0 = 1/2 or 0.5.\n2. Optionally, verifying this result using a different method or tool to ensure accuracy.\n",
