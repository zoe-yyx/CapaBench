    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify and list the given information:\n   - Triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF\n   - In triangle ABC, AB is twice as long as BC\n   - BC = 7 cm\n   - In triangle DEF, DE is the longest side and DE = 28 cm\n\n2. Determine the lengths of sides in triangle ABC:\n   - BC = 7 cm\n   - AB = 2 * BC = 2 * 7 = 14 cm\n   - Calculate AC using the Pythagorean theorem\n\n3. Identify the corresponding sides between the similar triangles:\n   - DE (longest side in DEF) corresponds to AB (longest side in ABC)\n\n4. Set up the similarity ratio between triangles ABC and DEF:\n   - Ratio = DE / AB\n\n5. Use the similarity ratio to find EF:\n   - EF corresponds to BC in triangle ABC\n   - Set up the proportion: EF / BC = DE / AB\n\n6. Solve for EF using the proportion from step 5\n\n7. Verify the answer by checking if it makes sense within the context of the problem\n\n8. Summarize the solution and state the final answer for the length of EF\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on determining the lengths of all sides in triangle ABC. We already know that BC = 7 cm and AB = 2 * BC = 14 cm. The next logical step is to calculate the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We have a right-angled triangle ABC with known lengths of two sides.\n2. We can use the Pythagorean theorem: AC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2\n3. Substituting the known values: AC\u00b2 = 14\u00b2 + 7\u00b2\n4. To find AC, we need to calculate this expression and then take the square root.\n\nThis calculation will give us the complete set of side lengths for triangle ABC, which is crucial for setting up the similarity ratio with triangle DEF in the next steps. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation accurately.\n",
