    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify and list the given information:\n   - Triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF\n   - In triangle ABC, AB is twice as long as BC\n   - BC = 7 cm\n   - In triangle DEF, DE is the longest side and DE = 28 cm\n\n2. Determine the lengths of sides in triangle ABC:\n   - BC = 7 cm\n   - AB = 2 * BC = 2 * 7 = 14 cm\n   - Calculate AC using the Pythagorean theorem\n\n3. Identify the corresponding sides between the similar triangles:\n   - DE (longest side in DEF) corresponds to AB (longest side in ABC)\n\n4. Set up the similarity ratio between triangles ABC and DEF:\n   - Ratio = DE / AB\n\n5. Use the similarity ratio to find EF:\n   - EF corresponds to BC in triangle ABC\n   - Set up the proportion: EF / BC = DE / AB\n\n6. Solve for EF using the proportion from step 5\n\n7. Verify the answer by checking if it makes sense within the context of the problem\n\n8. Summarize the solution and state the final answer for the length of EF\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated all the side lengths of triangle ABC and established the similarity ratio between triangles ABC and DEF. The next logical step is to verify our calculation of EF and formulate the final answer.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We've determined that the similarity ratio between triangles ABC and DEF is 2.\n2. We've calculated that EF = 2 * BC = 2 * 7 = 14 cm.\n3. To ensure the accuracy of our solution, we should verify this result using the similarity ratio in a different way:\n   - We know DE (28 cm) corresponds to AB (14 cm)\n   - We can set up the proportion: EF / BC = DE / AB\n   - Substituting the known values: EF / 7 = 28 / 14\n4. Solving this proportion would confirm our calculation of EF = 14 cm.\n5. Once verified, we can confidently state the final answer.\n\nThe acting agent should use this reasoning to set up and solve the proportion EF / 7 = 28 / 14 to verify our result, and then formulate the final answer statement.\n",
