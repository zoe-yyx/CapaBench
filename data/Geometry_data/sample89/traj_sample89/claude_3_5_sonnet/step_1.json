    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify and list the given information:\n   - Triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF\n   - In triangle ABC, AB is twice as long as BC\n   - BC = 7 cm\n   - In triangle DEF, DE is the longest side and DE = 28 cm\n\n2. Determine the lengths of sides in triangle ABC:\n   - BC = 7 cm\n   - AB = 2 * BC = 2 * 7 = 14 cm\n   - Calculate AC using the Pythagorean theorem\n\n3. Identify the corresponding sides between the similar triangles:\n   - DE (longest side in DEF) corresponds to AB (longest side in ABC)\n\n4. Set up the similarity ratio between triangles ABC and DEF:\n   - Ratio = DE / AB\n\n5. Use the similarity ratio to find EF:\n   - EF corresponds to BC in triangle ABC\n   - Set up the proportion: EF / BC = DE / AB\n\n6. Solve for EF using the proportion from step 5\n\n7. Verify the answer by checking if it makes sense within the context of the problem\n\n8. Summarize the solution and state the final answer for the length of EF\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the length of AC (15.65 cm), we have all the side lengths of triangle ABC:\n- AB = 14 cm\n- BC = 7 cm\n- AC = 15.65 cm\n\nThe next logical step is to set up the similarity ratio between triangles ABC and DEF. We know that DE is the longest side in triangle DEF and corresponds to AB in triangle ABC. We can use this information to establish the similarity ratio.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The similarity ratio is DE / AB = 28 / 14 = 2\n2. This ratio tells us that all sides of triangle DEF are twice as long as the corresponding sides in triangle ABC\n3. We're looking for EF, which corresponds to BC in triangle ABC\n4. Since BC = 7 cm and the ratio is 2, we can deduce that EF = 2 * BC\n\nTo find the exact length of EF, we need to multiply BC by 2. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this simple multiplication for precision.\n",
