    "observation": "If a trapezoid has bases of 10 units and 14 units, and the height is 5 units, find the area of the trapezoid.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the area of a trapezoid:\n   Area = (a + b) * h / 2\n   Where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides (bases), and h is the height.\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Base 1 (a) = 10 units\n   - Base 2 (b) = 14 units\n   - Height (h) = 5 units\n\n3. Substitute the given values into the formula:\n   Area = (10 + 14) * 5 / 2\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Add the bases: 10 + 14 = 24\n   - Multiply by the height: 24 * 5 = 120\n   - Divide by 2: 120 / 2 = 60\n\n5. Calculate the final result using a calculator if needed.\n\n6. Verify the answer by ensuring it's a positive number and the units are square units.\n\n7. Present the final answer: The area of the trapezoid is 60 square units.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, our next step should be to apply the formula for the area of a trapezoid. We have all the necessary information to do this:\n\n1. We know the formula: Area = (a + b) * h / 2\n2. We have the values:\n   - a = 10 units (first base)\n   - b = 14 units (second base)\n   - h = 5 units (height)\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to substitute these values into the formula and perform the calculation. This will involve:\n\n1. Adding the two bases: 10 + 14\n2. Multiplying the result by the height: (10 + 14) * 5\n3. Dividing the result by 2: [(10 + 14) * 5] / 2\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these operations accurately. After calculation, we'll have the area of the trapezoid in square units.\n",
