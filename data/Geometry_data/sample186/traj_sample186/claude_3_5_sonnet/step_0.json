Understand the implications of similarity:\n   - All corresponding sides are proportional\n   - All corresponding angles are equal\n\n3. Identify the key steps to solve the problem:\n   a) Find the length of QR in Triangle STU\n   b) Determine which side in Triangle PQR corresponds to TU in Triangle STU\n\n4. Calculate the length of QR in Triangle STU:\n   - Use the similarity ratio to determine that QR in STU is twice the length of QR in PQR\n\n5. Determine the corresponding side to TU:\n   - Recognize that TU in STU likely corresponds to QR in PQR due to the given information\n\n6. Apply the similarity ratio to find TU:\n   - Use the proportion established by the similarity ratio to calculate TU\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated length of TU makes sense given the similarity ratio and original measurements\n\n8. Summarize the solution process and state the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should start by focusing on the similarity between triangles PQR and STU. The key point is that their similarity ratio is 1:2, which means that all corresponding sides in triangle STU are twice as long as those in triangle PQR.\n\nWe're given that QR in triangle PQR is 12 cm. This side corresponds to TU in triangle STU, which is what we're trying to find. Since the ratio is 1:2, we can deduce that TU will be twice the length of QR.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to calculate the length of TU by multiplying the length of QR by 2. This simple calculation will give us the answer we're looking for.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this multiplication:\n12 cm * 2 = TU\n",
