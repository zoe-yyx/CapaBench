    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze given information:\n   - Triangle PQR with altitude PS\n   - QR = 12 cm\n   - PS = 5 cm\n   - Triangle PQR is similar to Triangle STU with ratio 1:2\n\n2. Understand the implications of similarity:\n   - All corresponding sides are proportional\n   - All corresponding angles are equal\n\n3. Identify the key steps to solve the problem:\n   a) Find the length of QR in Triangle STU\n   b) Determine which side in Triangle PQR corresponds to TU in Triangle STU\n\n4. Calculate the length of QR in Triangle STU:\n   - Use the similarity ratio to determine that QR in STU is twice the length of QR in PQR\n\n5. Determine the corresponding side to TU:\n   - Recognize that TU in STU likely corresponds to QR in PQR due to the given information\n\n6. Apply the similarity ratio to find TU:\n   - Use the proportion established by the similarity ratio to calculate TU\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated length of TU makes sense given the similarity ratio and original measurements\n\n8. Summarize the solution process and state the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the reflection, we need to adjust our approach slightly:\n\n1. Our calculation of TU = 24 cm was correct, but we need to present the answer differently.\n\n2. The problem asks to \"find the length of TU\", so we should instruct the acting agent to provide only the numerical value without units or variable names.\n\n3. We've correctly used the similarity ratio of 1:2 between triangles PQR and STU to determine that TU is twice the length of QR (12 cm).\n\n4. The calculation 12 * 2 = 24 remains valid.\n\n5.

Confirm that 24 is the correct numerical value for the length of TU.\n2. Present this value as the final answer without any additional text, units, or variable names.\n3. If required to explain, mention that this value was derived from the similarity ratio between triangles PQR and STU, where TU in STU corresponds to QR in PQR, and is twice its length due to the 1:2 ratio.\n\nThe acting agent should now provide the final answer as just the number 24.\n",
