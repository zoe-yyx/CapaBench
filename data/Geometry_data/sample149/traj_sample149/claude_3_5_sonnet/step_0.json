    "observation": "You have an equilateral triangle and you perform a rotation about its centroid. What is the minimum degree of rotation needed for the triangle to coincide with its original position?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand key concepts:\n   - Define equilateral triangle\n   - Identify the centroid of an equilateral triangle\n   - Understand rotational symmetry\n\n2. Analyze the problem:\n   - Recognize that an equilateral triangle has 3-fold rotational symmetry\n   - Consider the symmetry of the triangle around its centroid\n\n3. Determine the rotation angle:\n   - Calculate the angle of rotation that brings the triangle back to its original position\n   - Understand that this angle is related to the symmetry of the triangle\n\n4. Calculate the minimum rotation:\n   - Recognize that the minimum rotation is the smallest non-zero angle that coincides with the original position\n   - Express this as a fraction of a full rotation (360\u00b0)\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated angle is indeed the minimum\n   - Ensure the triangle coincides with its original position after this rotation\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the minimum rotation in degrees\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on the key aspects of equilateral triangle geometry and rotational symmetry.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo determine the minimum degree of rotation needed for an equilateral triangle to coincide with its original position when rotated about its centroid, we need to consider the rotational symmetry of an equilateral triangle.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. An equilateral triangle has three-fold rotational symmetry.\n2. This means it will look the same after rotations of 360\u00b0/3 = 120\u00b0, 240\u00b0, and 360\u00b0.\n\nThe minimum non-zero rotation that brings the triangle back to its original position would be the smallest of these angles, which is 120\u00b0.\n\nTo verify this, we can consider:\n- A 120\u00b0 rotation will bring each vertex to the position of the next vertex.\n- Any rotation less than 120\u00b0 will not complete this transformation.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that 120\u00b0 is the minimum rotation needed for the triangle to coincide with its original position.\n\nThe next step should be to express this angle formally and verify if there are any smaller angles that could work (which there aren't, but it's good to confirm).\n",
