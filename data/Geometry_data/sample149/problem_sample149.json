    "problem": "You have an equilateral triangle and you perform a rotation about its centroid. What is the minimum degree of rotation needed for the triangle to coincide with its original position?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "An equilateral triangle has rotational symmetry of $120$ degrees around its centroid. Thus, rotating it by $\\boxed{120}$ degrees will make it coincide with its original position.",
