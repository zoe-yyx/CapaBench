    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the two fixed points are both on the x-axis, we only need to consider the distance from the third point to the x-axis. The maximum value of the sine function is 1, so the maximum distance to the x-axis is also 1. Therefore, the maximum area is $0.5 \\times 4 \\times 1 = \\boxed{2}$.",
