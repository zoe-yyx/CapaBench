Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 150\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Note that 150\u00b0 is in the second quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n2. Use angle addition formula:\n   - Recognize that 150\u00b0 can be written as 90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0.\n   - Recall the cosine addition formula: cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB.\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Set up the equation: cos 150\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0)\n   - Use the formula: cos(90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 60\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 60\u00b0\n\n4. Recall known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 60\u00b0 = 1/2\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - sin 60\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n\n5. Substitute and calculate:\n   - Replace the known values in the equation.\n   - Perform the multiplication and subtraction.\n\n6. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms if necessary.\n   - Express the final answer in its simplest form.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense (should be negative in the second quadrant).\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the decimal approximation.\n",
