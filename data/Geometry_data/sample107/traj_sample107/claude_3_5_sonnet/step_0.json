    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 150\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Note that 150\u00b0 is in the second quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n2. Use angle addition formula:\n   - Recognize that 150\u00b0 can be written as 90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0.\n   - Recall the cosine addition formula: cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB.\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Set up the equation: cos 150\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0)\n   - Use the formula: cos(90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 60\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 60\u00b0\n\n4. Recall known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 60\u00b0 = 1/2\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - sin 60\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n\n5. Substitute and calculate:\n   - Replace the known values in the equation.\n   - Perform the multiplication and subtraction.\n\n6. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms if necessary.\n   - Express the final answer in its simplest form.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense (should be negative in the second quadrant).\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the decimal approximation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we should start by applying the angle addition formula as outlined in step 2 of the planning strategy. This is because 150\u00b0 is not a standard angle with a known cosine value, but we can break it down into the sum of two angles we're more familiar with: 90\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.\n\nLet's set up the equation using the cosine addition formula:\n\ncos 150\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 60\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 60\u00b0\n\nThis step aligns with both steps 2 and 3 of our planning strategy. It allows us to express cos 150\u00b0 in terms of trigonometric functions of angles we know well (90\u00b0 and 60\u00b0).\n\nThe next logical step would be to recall the known values for these trigonometric functions, as mentioned in step 4 of our strategy. This will prepare us for the substitution and calculation phase.\n",
