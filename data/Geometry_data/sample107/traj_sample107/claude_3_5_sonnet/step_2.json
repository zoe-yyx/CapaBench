Recognize the angle:\n   - Identify that 150\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Note that 150\u00b0 is in the second quadrant of the unit circle.\n\n2. Use angle addition formula:\n   - Recognize that 150\u00b0 can be written as 90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0.\n   - Recall the cosine addition formula: cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB.\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Set up the equation: cos 150\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0)\n   - Use the formula: cos(90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 60\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 60\u00b0\n\n4. Recall known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 60\u00b0 = 1/2\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - sin 60\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n\n5. Substitute and calculate:\n   - Replace the known values in the equation.\n   - Perform the multiplication and subtraction.\n\n6. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms if necessary.\n   - Express the final answer in its simplest form.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense (should be negative in the second quadrant).\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to confirm the decimal approximation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe acting agent has successfully calculated the result of the cosine addition formula for cos 150\u00b0. Let's analyze the current progress:\n\n1. We correctly identified that 150\u00b0 = 90\u00b0 + 60\u00b0.\n2. We applied the cosine addition formula: cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB.\n3. We substituted the known values:\n   cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   cos 60\u00b0 = 1/2\n   sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   sin 60\u00b0 = \u221a3/2\n4. The calculation 0 * (1/2) - 1 * (\u221a3/2) was performed, resulting in -0.866025403784439.\n\nThis decimal result is correct, but we can express it in a more precise mathematical form. The \u221a3/2 in the calculation suggests that our final answer can be written as a fraction involving \u221a3.\n\nThe next logical step is to recognize that -0.866025403784439 is very close to -\u221a3/2. In fact, it is exactly -\u221a3/2.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should:\n1. Confirm that the decimal result -0.866025403784439 is indeed equal to -\u221a3/2.\n2. Express the final answer for cos 150\u00b0 as -\u221a3/2.\n3. Verify that this result makes sense, as cos 150\u00b0 should be negative (since 150\u00b0 is in the second quadrant) and have a magnitude less than 1.\n",
