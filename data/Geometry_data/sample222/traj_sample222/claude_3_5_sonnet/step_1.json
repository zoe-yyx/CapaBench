    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of internal angles of a polygon:\n   - Identify the formula: (n - 2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides\n\n2. Apply the formula to our nonagon:\n   - Substitute n = 9 into the formula\n   - Calculate the result\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Consider the properties of an equiangular polygon\n   - Check if the result makes sense for a 9-sided polygon\n\n4. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate the measure of each internal angle\n   - Confirm that this matches the equiangular property\n\n5. Summarize the solution:\n   - State the final answer clearly\n   - Explain why the side lengths don't affect the sum of internal angles\n\nNote: This problem can be solved in fewer than 10 rounds as it primarily involves applying a known formula and basic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation performed by the acting agent, we now have the sum of the internal angles of the nonagon. Let's analyze this result:\n\n1. The calculation (9 - 2) * 180\u00b0 = 1260\u00b0 gives us the total sum of the internal angles of the nonagon.\n\n2. This result aligns with our expectations for a 9-sided polygon. It's greater than the sum for an octagon (1080\u00b0) and less than that of a decagon (1440\u00b0).\n\n3. The fact that the nonagon is equiangular is important for our next step. In an equiangular polygon, all internal angles are equal.\n\n4. To further verify our solution and gain more insight, we should calculate the measure of each internal angle.\n\n5. Since there are 9 equal angles that sum to 1260\u00b0, we need to divide 1260\u00b0 by 9 to find the measure of each angle.\n\nTherefore, our next logical step is to calculate the measure of each internal angle of this equiangular nonagon. This will help us confirm that the polygon is indeed equiangular and provide a complete solution to the problem.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation: 1260 \u00f7 9\n",
