    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of internal angles of a polygon:\n   - Identify the formula: (n - 2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides\n\n2. Apply the formula to our nonagon:\n   - Substitute n = 9 into the formula\n   - Calculate the result\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Consider the properties of an equiangular polygon\n   - Check if the result makes sense for a 9-sided polygon\n\n4. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate the measure of each internal angle\n   - Confirm that this matches the equiangular property\n\n5. Summarize the solution:\n   - State the final answer clearly\n   - Explain why the side lengths don't affect the sum of internal angles\n\nNote: This problem can be solved in fewer than 10 rounds as it primarily involves applying a known formula and basic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, our first step should be to recall and apply the formula for the sum of internal angles of a polygon. This formula is crucial for solving the problem and doesn't require any complex calculations or external information.\n\nThe formula we need is: (n - 2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides in the polygon.\n\nIn this case, we have a nonagon, which is a 9-sided polygon. Therefore, n = 9.\n\nOur next step should be to substitute this value into the formula and perform the calculation. This will give us the sum of the internal angles of the nonagon.\n\nIt's important to note that the varying side lengths (2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, and 2 units) do not affect the sum of the internal angles. The sum depends only on the number of sides in the polygon.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation: (9 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n",
