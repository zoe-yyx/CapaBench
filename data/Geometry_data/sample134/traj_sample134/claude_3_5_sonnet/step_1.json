    "planning_context": "\n1. Review the given information:\n   - Base = 10 units\n   - Height = 7 units\n   - One angle = 60\u00b0\n\n2. Recall the formula for the area of a parallelogram:\n   Area = base * height\n\n3. Calculate the area of the parallelogram using the given base and height.\n\n4. Recall the trigonometric relationship in a parallelogram:\n   sin(angle) = height / side\n\n5. Use the sine of 60\u00b0 (which is a known value) and the calculated height to find the length of the other side.\n\n6. Apply the sine formula:\n   sin(60\u00b0) = 7 / side\n\n7. Solve the equation for 'side'.\n\n8. Use a calculator to compute the final value.\n\n9. Round the result to 2 decimal places.\n\n10. Verify the answer by checking if it satisfies all given conditions.\n",
