    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the special angle values:\n   - Identify that 135\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Remember that 135\u00b0 can be expressed as 90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0.\n\n2. Use the cosine of the sum of angles formula:\n   - Recall the formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n   - In this case, A = 90\u00b0 and B = 45\u00b0\n\n3. Simplify using known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2 (or \u221a2/2)\n\n4. Apply the formula:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 45\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 45\u00b0\n\n5. Substitute known values and calculate:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = (0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) - (1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) = -1/\u221a2\n\n7. Simplify if necessary:\n   - The result -1/\u221a2 can also be expressed as -\u221a2/2\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the value makes sense (should be negative and between -1 and 0)\n   - Use a calculator to confirm the decimal approximation if needed\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the problem, we should start by applying the cosine of the sum of angles formula. This is a crucial step in solving for cos 135\u00b0.\n\nLet's reason through this:\n\n1. We know that 135\u00b0 can be expressed as 90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0. This is important because we have known values for cos 90\u00b0 and cos 45\u00b0.\n\n2. The cosine of the sum of angles formula states:\n   cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n\n3. In our case, A = 90\u00b0 and B = 45\u00b0, so we can rewrite our problem as:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 45\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 45\u00b0\n\n4. Now, we need to recall some special angle values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2 (or \u221a2/2)\n\n5. The next step would be to substitute these known values into our equation.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on substituting these known values into the cosine of the sum of angles formula and simplifying the expression.\n",
