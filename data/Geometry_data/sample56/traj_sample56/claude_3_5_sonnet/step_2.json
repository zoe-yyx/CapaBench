    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the special angle values:\n   - Identify that 135\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Remember that 135\u00b0 can be expressed as 90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0.\n\n2. Use the cosine of the sum of angles formula:\n   - Recall the formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n   - In this case, A = 90\u00b0 and B = 45\u00b0\n\n3. Simplify using known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2 (or \u221a2/2)\n\n4. Apply the formula:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 45\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 45\u00b0\n\n5. Substitute known values and calculate:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = (0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) - (1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) = -1/\u221a2\n\n7. Simplify if necessary:\n   - The result -1/\u221a2 can also be expressed as -\u221a2/2\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the value makes sense (should be negative and between -1 and 0)\n   - Use a calculator to confirm the decimal approximation if needed\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the result from the calculator, we can proceed with the final steps of our solution:\n\n1. We have calculated that cos 135\u00b0 = -0.707106781186548\n\n2. This decimal result is very close to -1/\u221a2, which aligns with our expected result from the planning strategy.\n\n3. To express this in a more precise mathematical form, we should convert the decimal back to the fraction -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2.\n\n4. We should also verify that this result makes sense:\n   - It's negative, which is correct for cos 135\u00b0 (in the second quadrant)\n   - Its absolute value is between 0 and 1, which is always true for cosine\n   - It's equal to -cos 45\u00b0, which is geometrically correct\n\n5. The final step is to present this result in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the next logical action for the acting agent should be to express the result as a fraction and present it as the final answer. The agent should state that cos 135\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2, and explain that this is equivalent to the decimal approximation we calculated.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on why the acting agent confirmed a wrong answer:\n\n```\nFlaw: The acting agent correctly calculated the value but incorrectly expressed the final answer by adding unnecessary notation.\n\nImprovement: The acting agent should provide only the numerical value or expression requested, without repeating the original problem statement or including additional mathematical notation.\n```\n\nThe reasoning and calculation process was correct, leading to the right value of -\u221a2/2. However, the final answer was presented as \"cos 135\u00b0 = -\u221a2/2\", which includes the original problem statement. This can be interpreted as part of the answer, leading to it being marked incorrect.\n\nFor future problems:\n\n1. The acting agent should focus on providing only the requested value or expression as the final answer.\n\n2. Unless specifically asked, avoid restating the problem or including additional mathematical notation in the answer.\n\n3. When dealing with trigonometric functions or other mathematical concepts, maintain fractions, radicals, and constants (like \u03c0) in their exact form rather than decimal approximations, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n\n4. Double-check that the answer format matches exactly what the question is asking for, without any extraneous information.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the acting agent can improve the accuracy and clarity of future responses, ensuring that correct calculations lead to correctly formatted answers.",
