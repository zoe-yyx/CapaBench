    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the special angle values:\n   - Identify that 135\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Remember that 135\u00b0 can be expressed as 90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0.\n\n2. Use the cosine of the sum of angles formula:\n   - Recall the formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n   - In this case, A = 90\u00b0 and B = 45\u00b0\n\n3. Simplify using known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2 (or \u221a2/2)\n\n4. Apply the formula:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 45\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 45\u00b0\n\n5. Substitute known values and calculate:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = (0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) - (1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) = -1/\u221a2\n\n7. Simplify if necessary:\n   - The result -1/\u221a2 can also be expressed as -\u221a2/2\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the value makes sense (should be negative and between -1 and 0)\n   - Use a calculator to confirm the decimal approximation if needed\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we should proceed with the substitution of known values into the cosine of the sum of angles formula. Let's guide the acting agent through this process:\n\n1. We've established that cos 135\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0)\n2. We're using the formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n3. We need to substitute the known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n   - sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n\n4. Let's substitute these values into our formula:\n   cos(90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = (cos 90\u00b0 \u00d7 cos 45\u00b0) - (sin 90\u00b0 \u00d7 sin 45\u00b0)\n                  = (0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) - (1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2)\n\nThe next logical step is to perform this calculation. The acting agent should use a calculator to:\na) Confirm that 0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2 = 0\nb) Calculate 1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2\nc) Subtract the result of (b) from 0\n\nThis calculation will lead us to the final result of cos 135\u00b0.\n",
