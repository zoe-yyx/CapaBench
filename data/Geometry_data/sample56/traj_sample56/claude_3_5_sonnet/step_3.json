    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the special angle values:\n   - Identify that 135\u00b0 is not a common angle with a known cosine value.\n   - Remember that 135\u00b0 can be expressed as 90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0.\n\n2. Use the cosine of the sum of angles formula:\n   - Recall the formula: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B\n   - In this case, A = 90\u00b0 and B = 45\u00b0\n\n3. Simplify using known values:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2 (or \u221a2/2)\n\n4. Apply the formula:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = cos(90\u00b0 + 45\u00b0) = cos 90\u00b0 cos 45\u00b0 - sin 90\u00b0 sin 45\u00b0\n\n5. Substitute known values and calculate:\n   - cos 90\u00b0 = 0\n   - sin 90\u00b0 = 1\n   - cos 45\u00b0 = sin 45\u00b0 = 1/\u221a2\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = (0 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) - (1 \u00d7 1/\u221a2) = -1/\u221a2\n\n7. Simplify if necessary:\n   - The result -1/\u221a2 can also be expressed as -\u221a2/2\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the value makes sense (should be negative and between -1 and 0)\n   - Use a calculator to confirm the decimal approximation if needed\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   cos 135\u00b0 = -1/\u221a2 or -\u221a2/2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe calculation and reasoning process we followed was correct, leading to the accurate value of -\u221a2/2 for cos 135\u00b0. However, the final presentation of the answer included unnecessary information that caused it to be marked as incorrect. To address this issue and provide the correct answer in the proper format, we should:\n\n1. Retain the correctly calculated value: -\u221a2/2\n\n2. Present this value as the final answer without restating the problem or including additional mathematical notation.\n\n3. Provide an alternative, equivalent form of the answer for completeness: -1/\u221a2\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should simply state the final answer as:\n\n-\u221a2/2 or -1/\u221a2\n\nThis presentation focuses solely on the requested value, avoiding any extraneous information that could be misinterpreted as part of the answer. It also provides the answer in two equivalent forms, which is often appreciated in mathematical contexts.\n",
