Determine the approach:\n   - Calculate how many small cubes can fit along each dimension of the larger cube\n   - Use this information to find the total number of small cubes\n\n3. Calculate the number of small cubes that fit along one side of the larger cube:\n   - Divide the side length of the larger cube by the side length of the smaller cube\n\n4. Compute the total number of small cubes:\n   - Use the result from step 3 to calculate the volume occupied by small cubes\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the calculated number makes sense given the dimensions\n   - Double-check calculations if necessary\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the total number of small cubes used to fill the larger cube\n",

Since we're dealing with a three-dimensional object, we need to consider all three dimensions.\n\nThe next step should be to calculate 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, which will give us the total number of small cubes that can fit in the larger cube.\n",
