    "planning_context": "\n1. Review and understand the given information:\n   - ABCD is a parallelogram\n   - Diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O\n   - AB = 10 units\n   - BC = 15 units\n   - Area of triangle AOB = 30 square units\n\n2. Recall key properties of parallelograms:\n   - Opposite sides are parallel and equal\n   - Diagonals bisect each other\n\n3. Determine the relationship between triangle AOB and the whole parallelogram:\n   - Triangle AOB is exactly half of triangle ABC\n   - The area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle AOB\n\n4. Calculate the area of triangle ABC:\n   - Area of triangle ABC = 2 \u00d7 Area of triangle AOB\n   - Area of triangle ABC = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60 square units\n\n5. Recall the relationship between a triangle's area and a parallelogram's area with the same base and height:\n   - Area of parallelogram = 2 \u00d7 Area of triangle with same base and half height\n\n6. Apply this relationship to find the area of parallelogram ABCD:\n   - Area of ABCD = 2 \u00d7 Area of triangle ABC\n   - Area of ABCD = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120 square units\n\n7. Verify the result by calculating the area using the formula: Area = base \u00d7 height\n   - We know AB and BC, but need to calculate the height\n   - Use the area of triangle ABC to find its height, then use this for the parallelogram\n\n8. Final answer: The area of parallelogram ABCD is 120 square units\n\n9. Reflect on the problem-solving process and check for any potential errors or alternative methods\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by focusing on the relationship between triangle AOB and the whole parallelogram ABCD.

In a parallelogram, the area is twice the area of a triangle formed by one of its diagonals.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\nArea of parallelogram ABCD = 2 \u00d7 Area of triangle ABC\n\nTo find the final answer, we should guide the acting agent to perform the following calculation:\nArea of parallelogram ABCD = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120 square units\n\nThis reasoning aligns with steps 3 through 6 in our planning strategy and should lead us directly to the solution.\n",
