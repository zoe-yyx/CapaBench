    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Hexagon Angle Problem:\n\n1. Recall key information:\n   - A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 angles\n   - The sum of interior angles in a hexagon is (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n = 6\n   - Two consecutive angles are right angles (90\u00b0 each)\n   - The remaining four angles are equal\n\n2. Calculate the sum of interior angles in a hexagon:\n   - Use the formula: (6-2) * 180\u00b0 = 4 * 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\n\n3. Subtract the known angles:\n   - Two right angles = 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   - Remaining angle sum = 720\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n\n4. Divide the remaining angle sum by 4:\n   - Since the four unknown angles are equal, divide 540\u00b0 by 4\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Ensure that the sum of all angles (2 right angles + 4 equal angles) equals 720\u00b0\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of each of the four equal angles\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds of calculation and verification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the measure of each of the four equal angles to be 135\u00b0, we should proceed to step 5 of our plan: verifying the solution.\n\nTo verify the solution, we need to ensure that the sum of all angles in the hexagon equals 720\u00b0. We can do this by adding:\n\n- Two right angles (90\u00b0 each)\n- Four equal angles (135\u00b0 each)\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this calculation:\n\n(90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0) + (135\u00b0 * 4)\n\nThis calculation will add up all the angles in the hexagon. If our solution is correct, the result should equal 720\u00b0, which is the total sum of interior angles in a hexagon that we calculated in the first step.\n\nIf this verification is successful, we can move to the final step of presenting the answer. If not, we'll need to review our calculations and reasoning.\n",
