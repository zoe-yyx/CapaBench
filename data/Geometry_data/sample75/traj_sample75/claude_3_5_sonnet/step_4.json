    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Hexagon Angle Problem:\n\n1. Recall key information:\n   - A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 angles\n   - The sum of interior angles in a hexagon is (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n = 6\n   - Two consecutive angles are right angles (90\u00b0 each)\n   - The remaining four angles are equal\n\n2. Calculate the sum of interior angles in a hexagon:\n   - Use the formula: (6-2) * 180\u00b0 = 4 * 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\n\n3. Subtract the known angles:\n   - Two right angles = 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   - Remaining angle sum = 720\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n\n4. Divide the remaining angle sum by 4:\n   - Since the four unknown angles are equal, divide 540\u00b0 by 4\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Ensure that the sum of all angles (2 right angles + 4 equal angles) equals 720\u00b0\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of each of the four equal angles\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds of calculation and verification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations we've performed and verified, we can now confidently move to the final step of our plan: presenting the answer to the original problem.\n\nLet's review what we've established:\n\n1. We calculated the total sum of interior angles in a hexagon: 720\u00b0\n2. We subtracted the two right angles (90\u00b0 each): 720\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n3. We divided the remaining sum by 4 to find each equal angle: 540\u00b0 \u00f7 4 = 135\u00b0\n4. We verified our solution by adding all angles: (90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0) + (135\u00b0 * 4) = 720\u00b0\n\nOur verification in the last step confirms that our solution is correct. The sum of all angles equals 720\u00b0, which matches the total sum of interior angles in a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that in this hexagon where two consecutive angles are right angles (90\u00b0 each), the measure of each of the other four equal angles is 135\u00b0.\n\nThe acting agent should now present this final answer clearly and concisely, stating that each of the four equal angles in the hexagon measures 135\u00b0.\n",
