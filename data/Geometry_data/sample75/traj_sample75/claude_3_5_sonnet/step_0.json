    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Hexagon Angle Problem:\n\n1. Recall key information:\n   - A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 angles\n   - The sum of interior angles in a hexagon is (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n = 6\n   - Two consecutive angles are right angles (90\u00b0 each)\n   - The remaining four angles are equal\n\n2. Calculate the sum of interior angles in a hexagon:\n   - Use the formula: (6-2) * 180\u00b0 = 4 * 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\n\n3. Subtract the known angles:\n   - Two right angles = 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   - Remaining angle sum = 720\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n\n4. Divide the remaining angle sum by 4:\n   - Since the four unknown angles are equal, divide 540\u00b0 by 4\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Ensure that the sum of all angles (2 right angles + 4 equal angles) equals 720\u00b0\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of each of the four equal angles\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds of calculation and verification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, our first step should be to calculate the sum of interior angles in a hexagon. This is a fundamental geometric fact that we need to establish before we can proceed with the problem.\n\nThe plan provides us with the formula: (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides in the polygon. In this case, n = 6 for a hexagon.\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to perform the following calculation:\n(6-2) * 180\u00b0 = 4 * 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\n\nThis calculation will give us the total sum of interior angles in a hexagon, which is crucial for the subsequent steps in our problem-solving process. Once we have this value, we can move on to subtracting the known right angles and determining the measure of the remaining equal angles.\n",
