    "observation": "In a hexagon, two consecutive angles are right angles. If the other four angles are equal, what is the measure of each of these four angles?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Hexagon Angle Problem:\n\n1. Recall key information:\n   - A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 angles\n   - The sum of interior angles in a hexagon is (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n = 6\n   - Two consecutive angles are right angles (90\u00b0 each)\n   - The remaining four angles are equal\n\n2. Calculate the sum of interior angles in a hexagon:\n   - Use the formula: (6-2) * 180\u00b0 = 4 * 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\n\n3. Subtract the known angles:\n   - Two right angles = 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   - Remaining angle sum = 720\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n\n4. Divide the remaining angle sum by 4:\n   - Since the four unknown angles are equal, divide 540\u00b0 by 4\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Ensure that the sum of all angles (2 right angles + 4 equal angles) equals 720\u00b0\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the measure of each of the four equal angles\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 rounds of calculation and verification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have confirmed the total sum of interior angles in a hexagon is 720\u00b0, we should move on to step 3 of our plan: subtracting the known angles.\n\nWe know that two consecutive angles are right angles, each measuring 90\u00b0. Therefore, we need to subtract these known angles from the total:\n\n720\u00b0 - (90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0) = 720\u00b0 - 180\u00b0\n\nThis calculation will give us the sum of the remaining four equal angles. Once we have this value, we can proceed to step 4, which involves dividing this sum by 4 to find the measure of each of the four equal angles.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this subtraction using a calculator.\n",
