    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Problem:\n\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have two externally tangent circles\n   - Radius of first circle = 5 units\n   - Radius of second circle = 3 units\n   - Goal: Find the distance between their centers\n\n2. Recall the formula for externally tangent circles:\n   - The distance between the centers of externally tangent circles is equal to the sum of their radii\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Distance = Radius of circle 1 + Radius of circle 2\n\n4. Perform the calculation:\n   - Add the radii: 5 + 3\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the calculation is correct\n   - Check if the answer makes geometric sense\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the distance between the centers of the circles\n\nThis plan should lead to a straightforward solution within 1-2 rounds, as the problem requires a simple application of a geometric principle and basic addition.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have two externally tangent circles, which means they touch each other at exactly one point on their outer edges.\n\n2. The key principle to solve this problem is that for externally tangent circles, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii.\n\n3. We are given the radii of the two circles:\n   - Radius of the first circle = 5 units\n   - Radius of the second circle = 3 units\n\n4. To find the distance between their centers, we simply need to add these two radii together.\n\n5. The next logical step is to perform this addition: 5 + 3\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to add 5 and 3 to determine the distance between the centers of the two externally tangent circles.\n",
