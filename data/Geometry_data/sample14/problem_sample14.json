    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since $X$ and $Z$ share the same $x$-coordinate, the line $XZ$ can be treated as the height of the triangle, which is $5 - 1 = 4$ units. The base of the triangle, $XY$, has a length of $4 - 1 = 3$ units as $Y$ and $X$ share the same $y$-coordinate. The area of $\\triangle XYZ$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = \\boxed{6}$ square units.",
