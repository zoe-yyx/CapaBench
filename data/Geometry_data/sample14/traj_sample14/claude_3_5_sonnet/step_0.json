    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem: We need to calculate the area of triangle XYZ given the coordinates of its vertices.\n\n2. Recall the formula: The area of a triangle can be calculated using the coordinates of its vertices with the formula:\n   Area = (1/2) * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\n3. Organize the given information:\n   X(1,1), Y(4,5), Z(1,5)\n   x1 = 1, y1 = 1\n   x2 = 4, y2 = 5\n   x3 = 1, y3 = 5\n\n4. Substitute the values into the formula:\n   Area = (1/2) * |1(5 - 5) + 4(5 - 1) + 1(1 - 5)|\n\n5. Simplify the expression inside the absolute value bars.\n\n6. Calculate the result of the simplified expression.\n\n7. Multiply by 1/2 to get the final area.\n\n8. Round the result if necessary and present the final answer.\n\n9. Verify the result by using an alternative method (e.g., calculating the base and height of the triangle) if time permits.\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider any potential optimizations or alternative approaches.\n",
