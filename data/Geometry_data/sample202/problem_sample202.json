    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The centers of the smaller circles form an equilateral triangle with side length 8. The circumradius of this triangle plus the radius of the small circle is the radius of the larger circle. Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{3} + 4}$.",
