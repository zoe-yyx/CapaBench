    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Triangle Problem:\n\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Triangle LMN with two altitudes\n   - Ratio of altitudes from L to MN and M to LN is 4:3\n   - Area of triangle LMN is 84\n\n2. Recall the formula for the area of a triangle:\n   Area = (1/2) * base * height\n\n3. Use the area formula to set up two equations:\n   - One using the altitude from L to MN\n   - One using the altitude from M to LN\n\n4. Express the altitudes in terms of a variable, using the given ratio\n\n5. Solve the equations to find the lengths of sides MN and LN\n\n6. Calculate the ratio of LN to MN\n\n7. Simplify the ratio if possible\n\n8. Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies all given conditions\n\n9. Present the final ratio of sides LN to MN\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider alternative methods if time allows\n",

This result (1.33333...) represents the ratio 4:3, which is the correct ratio of LN to MN.\n\n4. The original question asks for the ratio of sides LN and MN, and we have determined this ratio to be 4:3.\n\n5. No further simplification or manipulation of this ratio is necessary.\n\nThe acting agent should now present this answer as a simple numeric ratio without any additional text or notation: 4:3\n\nThis reasoning directly addresses the original question, provides the answer in the correct and simplest ratio format, and avoids any unnecessary explanations or notations that could lead to misinterpretation.\n",
