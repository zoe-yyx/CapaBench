    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron is $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{12}a^3$, where $a$ is the edge length. Substituting $a = 12$ cm, we get $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{12}(12)^3 = 144\\sqrt{2}$ cubic cm. \\(\\boxed{144\\sqrt{2}}\\)",
