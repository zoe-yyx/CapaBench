Reflect the shape:\n   - Explain the concept of reflection over the line y=x\n   - Determine the new coordinates of each point after reflection\n\n3. Identify the furthest point:\n   - Calculate the distance of each reflected point from the origin (0,0)\n   - Compare the distances to find the point furthest from the origin\n\n4. Find the abscissa:\n   - Identify the x-coordinate (abscissa) of the furthest point\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Double-check calculations and reasoning\n   - Ensure the answer makes sense geometrically\n\nKey formulas and concepts to use:\n- Reflection over y=x: (x,y) becomes (y,x)\n- Distance formula: d = \u221a((x\u2082-x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082-y\u2081)\u00b2)\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator for distance calculations and coordinate transformations if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, let's guide the acting agent through the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to reflect the given square over the line y=x. The reflection rule states that for any point (x,y), its reflection over y=x is (y,x). Let's apply this to our four points:\n\n   (0,0) reflects to (0,0)\n   (2,0) reflects to (0,2)\n   (2,2) reflects to (2,2)\n   (0,2) reflects to (2,0)\n\n2. Now that we have the reflected points, we need to find which one is furthest from the origin (0,0). To do this, we'll need to calculate the distance of each point from (0,0) using the distance formula: d = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n3. The acting agent should use a calculator to compute these distances:\n\n   For (0,0): d = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = 0\n   For (0,2): d = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = 2\n   For (2,2): d = \u221a(2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = \u221a8 \u2248 2.83\n   For (2,0): d = \u221a(2\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = 2\n\n4. After calculating these distances, we can see that the point (2,2) is furthest from the origin.\n\n5. The question asks for the abscissa (x-coordinate) of the furthest point. The abscissa of (2,2) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should conclude that the abscissa of the point furthest from the origin in the reflected shape is 2.\n",
