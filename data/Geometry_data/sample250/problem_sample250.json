    "problem": "A rectangle is reflected across its longer side to form a new rectangle. What is the ratio between the area of the original rectangle and the new rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The reflection of a rectangle across its longer side results in a rectangle of the same dimensions as the original rectangle. Therefore, the area of the new rectangle is equal to the area of the original rectangle, as reflection is a rigid transformation that preserves area. \\(\\boxed{1}\\)",
