    "observation": "A kite has diagonals of lengths 18 cm and 24 cm. What is the area of the kite?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the area of a kite:\n   - Area of a kite = (d1 * d2) / 2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals\n\n2. Identify the given information:\n   - Diagonal 1 (d1) = 18 cm\n   - Diagonal 2 (d2) = 24 cm\n\n3. Apply the area formula:\n   - Substitute the known values into the formula\n   - Calculate (18 * 24) / 2\n\n4. Perform the calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to multiply 18 by 24\n   - Then divide the result by 2\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in square centimeters (cm\u00b2)\n   - Round to the nearest whole number if necessary\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the answer seems reasonable given the dimensions of the kite\n   - Ensure all units are correctly stated in the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have the formula for the area of a kite: Area = (d1 * d2) / 2\n2. We know the lengths of both diagonals: d1 = 18 cm and d2 = 24 cm\n3. The next logical step is to substitute these values into the formula and perform the calculation\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to:\na) Multiply 18 by 24\nb) Divide the result by 2\n\nThis calculation will give us the area of the kite in square centimeters. After performing this calculation, we can move on to presenting and verifying the final answer.\n",
