    "problem": "A kite has diagonals of lengths 18 cm and 24 cm. What is the area of the kite?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of a kite is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals. Substituting the given values, $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 \\times 24 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 432 = 216$. Thus, the area of the kite is $\\boxed{216}$.",
