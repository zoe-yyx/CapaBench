    "observation": "The vertices of the square are located at $A(1,1), B(4,1), C(4,4), D(1,4)$. If the square is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin, what is the abscissa of the new position of point $C$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - Square vertices: A(1,1), B(4,1), C(4,4), D(1,4)\n   - Rotation: 90 degrees counterclockwise\n   - Rotation center: Origin (0,0)\n   - Goal: Find the x-coordinate (abscissa) of the new position of point C\n\n2. Recall the formula for 90-degree counterclockwise rotation about the origin:\n   (x, y) \u2192 (-y, x)\n\n3. Apply the rotation formula to point C(4,4):\n   - Original C(x, y) = (4, 4)\n   - Rotated C(x', y') = (-y, x) = (-4, 4)\n\n4. Identify the new x-coordinate (abscissa) of point C after rotation:\n   - New x-coordinate = -4\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the new position makes sense geometrically\n   - Optionally, apply the rotation to other points to confirm consistency\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   The abscissa of point C after a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation about the origin is -4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we can guide the acting agent through the following reasoning:\n\n1. We need to focus on point C, which has the original coordinates (4, 4).\n\n2. The key to solving this problem is applying the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation formula about the origin. This formula states that for any point (x, y), after a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation about the origin, its new coordinates will be (-y, x).\n\n3. Let's apply this formula to point C(4, 4):\n   - The original x-coordinate (4) will become the new y-coordinate\n   - The original y-coordinate (4) will become the negative of the new x-coordinate\n\n4. Therefore, the new coordinates of point C after rotation will be (-4, 4).\n\n5. The question specifically asks for the abscissa (x-coordinate) of the new position of point C.\n\n6. From our calculation, we can see that the new x-coordinate (abscissa) is -4.\n\nThe acting agent should verify this result by using a calculator to apply the rotation formula to the point (4, 4), confirming that it indeed results in (-4, 4).\n",
