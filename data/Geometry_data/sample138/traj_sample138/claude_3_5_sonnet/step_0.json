    "planning_context": "\n1. Review the given information:\n   - Triangle GHI is similar to triangle JKL\n   - Length of GH = 8 cm\n   - Length of JK = 12 cm\n   - Height from J to KL = 16 cm\n\n2. Recall the properties of similar triangles:\n   - Corresponding angles are equal\n   - Corresponding sides are proportional\n\n3. Establish the scale factor between the triangles:\n   - Scale factor = GH : JK = 8 : 12\n   - Simplify this ratio if possible\n\n4. Use the scale factor to set up a proportion:\n   - The heights of the triangles will be in the same ratio as their corresponding sides\n\n5. Set up an equation to solve for the unknown height from G to HI:\n   - Let x be the height from G to HI\n   - Create a proportion using the scale factor and known height\n\n6. Solve the equation for x:\n   - Use algebraic methods to isolate x\n\n7. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Use a calculator if necessary\n\n8. Round the answer to 2 decimal places as requested\n\n9. Double-check the solution:\n   - Ensure the answer makes sense given the original triangle sizes\n   - Verify that all steps of the problem have been addressed\n\n10. Present the final answer in the required format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should start by establishing the scale factor between the two similar triangles. This will be crucial for setting up the proportion to find the unknown height.\n\nLet's reason through this:\n\n1. We know that GH = 8 cm and JK = 12 cm.\n2. The scale factor between these triangles is GH : JK = 8 : 12.\n3. This ratio can be simplified to 2 : 3.\n\nNow that we have the scale factor, we can set up a proportion to find the unknown height. Let's call the height from G to HI 'x'.\n\nSince the triangles are similar, we know that:\nGH : JK = x : 16\n\nUsing our simplified scale factor, this becomes:\n2 : 3 = x : 16\n\nThis proportion will allow us to solve for x, which is the height we're looking for. The next step would be to set up an equation based on this proportion and solve for x.\n\nThe acting agent should use this reasoning to set up the equation and solve for x using a calculator if needed.\n",
