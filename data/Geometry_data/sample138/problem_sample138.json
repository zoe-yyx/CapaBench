    "problem": "Triangle $GHI$ is similar to triangle $JKL$, with the length of $GH$ being 8 cm and $JK$ being 12 cm. If the height from $J$ to $KL$ is 16 cm, what is the height from $G$ to $HI$? Give the answer in decimal and round to 2 decimal places",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding heights is equal to the ratio of corresponding bases. Therefore, the height from $G$ to $HI$ is $\\frac{8}{12} \\times 16 = \\boxed{10.67} \\text{ cm}$.",
