    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Imagine a square ABCD inscribed in a circle with center O\n   - We need to find the measure of angle AOB\n\n2. Recall key properties:\n   - In a square, all sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees\n   - The diagonal of a square bisects its angles\n   - The diagonal of a square forms two 45-45-90 triangles\n\n3. Analyze the geometry:\n   - Triangle AOB is formed by connecting the center to two adjacent vertices of the square\n   - This triangle contains half of the square's diagonal\n\n4. Apply trigonometric reasoning:\n   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the non-hypotenuse sides are equal\n   - The angle at the center (angle AOB) will be twice the angle at the circumference\n\n5. Calculate the angle:\n   - Determine that angle OAB is 45 degrees\n   - Conclude that angle AOB must be 90 degrees\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if this answer makes sense given the properties of inscribed squares in circles\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State that m\u2220AOB = 90\u00b0\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the given 10-round limit, utilizing geometric properties and logical deduction without requiring complex calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Let's start by visualizing the square ABCD inscribed in circle O.\n\n2. Key geometric properties to consider:\n   - The sides of the square are chords of the circle.\n   - The diagonal of the square is not the diameter of the circle.\n   - Angle AOB is a central angle that corresponds to one side of the square.\n\n3. Relationship between the square and the circle:\n   - The square divides the circle into four equal arcs.\n   - Each side of the square subtends a quarter of the circle's circumference.\n\n4. Central angle theorem:\n   - The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc.\n   - In this case, the central angle AOB corresponds to one side of the square, which is a quarter of the circle.\n\n5. Calculation:\n   - A full circle is 360\u00b0.\n   - One quarter of 360\u00b0 is 90\u00b0.\n   - Therefore, the central angle AOB must measure 90\u00b0.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - This result makes sense because the four congruent central angles (AOB, BOC, COD, and DOA) should add up to 360\u00b0.\n   - 90\u00b0 \u00d7 4 = 360\u00b0, which confirms our reasoning.\n\nBased on this revised reasoning, we can confidently conclude that the measure of angle AOB is indeed 90\u00b0.\n",
