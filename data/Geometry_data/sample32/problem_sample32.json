    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since $ABCD$ is a square, all angles are $90^{\\circ}$. The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect the square's angles, thus forming four right triangles. Each angle at the center $O$ is half the total $360^{\\circ}$, hence $m\\angle AOB = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{4} = \\boxed{90^{\\circ}}$.",
