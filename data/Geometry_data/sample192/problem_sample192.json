    "problem": "A cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a base radius of 3 cm. A cone is inside the cylinder such that its vertex is at the center of the top of the cylinder and its base is the same as the base of the cylinder. What is the volume of the space between the cone and the cylinder?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of the cylinder is $V_c = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi (3)^2 (10) = 90\\pi$. The volume of the cone is $V_{cn} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (3)^2 (10) = 30\\pi$. The volume of the space between them is $V_c - V_{cn} = 90\\pi - 30\\pi = 60\\pi$ cubic cm. \\(\\boxed{60\\pi}\\)",
