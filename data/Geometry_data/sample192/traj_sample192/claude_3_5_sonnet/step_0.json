    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Cylinder-Cone Volume Problem:\n\n1. Identify the known information:\n   - Cylinder height: 10 cm\n   - Cylinder base radius: 3 cm\n   - Cone base is the same as cylinder base\n   - Cone vertex is at the center of the cylinder's top\n\n2. Recall necessary formulas:\n   - Volume of a cylinder: V_cylinder = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n   - Volume of a cone: V_cone = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\n3. Calculate the volume of the cylinder:\n   - Use the formula V_cylinder = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n   - Substitute known values and calculate\n\n4. Calculate the volume of the cone:\n   - Note that the cone has the same radius as the cylinder\n   - The height of the cone is the same as the cylinder's height\n   - Use the formula V_cone = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n   - Substitute known values and calculate\n\n5. Find the volume of the space between:\n   - Subtract the volume of the cone from the volume of the cylinder\n\n6. Round the final answer to an appropriate number of decimal places\n\n7. Check the reasonableness of the result:\n   - Ensure the difference in volumes is less than the cylinder's volume\n   - Verify that the units are in cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3)\n\n8. If needed, use a calculator for complex calculations or a search engine to verify formulas\n\n9. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider alternative methods if time permits\n",
