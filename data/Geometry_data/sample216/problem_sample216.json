    "problem": "Consider a rectangle with a perimeter of 100 units. Find the maximum area a rectangle can have if its length is at most 5 units more than twice its width and at least twice its width.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 100 units, given the length is between 2w and 2w+5, we express the length as \\( l = 50 - w \\) from the perimeter equation, substitute into the area formula \\( A = l \times w \\), and evaluate the area at the boundary values \\( w = 15 \\) and \\( w = \\frac{50}{3} \\), finding the maximum area to be approximately $\\boxed{\\frac{5000}{9}}$ square units.",
