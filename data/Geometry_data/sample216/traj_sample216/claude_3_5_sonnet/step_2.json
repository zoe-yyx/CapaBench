    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rectangle Area Optimization Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let w = width of the rectangle\n   - Let l = length of the rectangle\n\n2. Express the constraints:\n   - Perimeter constraint: 2w + 2l = 100\n   - Length constraint: 2w \u2264 l \u2264 2w + 5\n\n3. Derive the area function:\n   - Area A = w * l\n\n4. Express length in terms of width using the perimeter constraint:\n   - l = 50 - w\n\n5. Substitute this into the area function:\n   - A = w(50 - w) = 50w - w\u00b2\n\n6. Consider the length constraints:\n   - 2w \u2264 50 - w \u2264 2w + 5\n   - Solve these inequalities to find the range of w\n\n7. Find the maximum of the quadratic function A = 50w - w\u00b2 within the valid range of w:\n   - Use calculus or the vertex formula for a parabola\n\n8. Calculate the maximum area:\n   - Substitute the optimal w into the area function\n\n9. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the optimal dimensions satisfy all constraints\n\n10. Present the final answer:\n    - Maximum area and the corresponding dimensions of the rectangle\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to solve the problem systematically, using algebraic manipulation, constraint analysis, and optimization techniques.\n",
