    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rectangle Area Optimization Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let w = width of the rectangle\n   - Let l = length of the rectangle\n\n2. Express the constraints:\n   - Perimeter constraint: 2w + 2l = 100\n   - Length constraint: 2w \u2264 l \u2264 2w + 5\n\n3. Derive the area function:\n   - Area A = w * l\n\n4. Express length in terms of width using the perimeter constraint:\n   - l = 50 - w\n\n5. Substitute this into the area function:\n   - A = w(50 - w) = 50w - w\u00b2\n\n6. Consider the length constraints:\n   - 2w \u2264 50 - w \u2264 2w + 5\n   - Solve these inequalities to find the range of w\n\n7. Find the maximum of the quadratic function A = 50w - w\u00b2 within the valid range of w:\n   - Use calculus or the vertex formula for a parabola\n\n8. Calculate the maximum area:\n   - Substitute the optimal w into the area function\n\n9. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the optimal dimensions satisfy all constraints\n\n10. Present the final answer:\n    - Maximum area and the corresponding dimensions of the rectangle\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to solve the problem systematically, using algebraic manipulation, constraint analysis, and optimization techniques.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations, we have found that the vertex of our quadratic function A = 50w - w\u00b2 occurs at w = 25. However, we need to consider this result in the context of our constraints.\n\nFrom our previous steps, we determined that the valid range for w is:\n15 \u2264 w \u2264 16.6666666666667\n\nThe vertex at w = 25 falls outside this range. This means that the maximum area within our constrained range will occur at one of the endpoints of our valid w interval.\n\nGiven that our area function A = 50w - w\u00b2 is a downward-facing parabola (because the coefficient of w\u00b2 is negative), and our valid range is to the left of the vertex, the maximum area will occur at the rightmost point of our valid range.\n\nTherefore, we should use w = 16.6666666666667 (rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places) to calculate the maximum area.\n\nThe next step should be to:\n\n1. Calculate the length l using the perimeter constraint: l = 50 - w\n2. Calculate the area A using A = w * l\n\nThis will give us the maximum area within the given constraints.\n",
