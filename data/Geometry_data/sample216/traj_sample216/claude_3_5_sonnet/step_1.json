    "observation": "Consider a rectangle with a perimeter of 100 units. Find the maximum area a rectangle can have if its length is at most 5 units more than twice its width and at least twice its width.",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Rectangle Area Optimization Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let w = width of the rectangle\n   - Let l = length of the rectangle\n\n2. Express the constraints:\n   - Perimeter constraint: 2w + 2l = 100\n   - Length constraint: 2w \u2264 l \u2264 2w + 5\n\n3. Derive the area function:\n   - Area A = w * l\n\n4. Express length in terms of width using the perimeter constraint:\n   - l = 50 - w\n\n5. Substitute this into the area function:\n   - A = w(50 - w) = 50w - w\u00b2\n\n6. Consider the length constraints:\n   - 2w \u2264 50 - w \u2264 2w + 5\n   - Solve these inequalities to find the range of w\n\n7. Find the maximum of the quadratic function A = 50w - w\u00b2 within the valid range of w:\n   - Use calculus or the vertex formula for a parabola\n\n8. Calculate the maximum area:\n   - Substitute the optimal w into the area function\n\n9. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the optimal dimensions satisfy all constraints\n\n10. Present the final answer:\n    - Maximum area and the corresponding dimensions of the rectangle\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to solve the problem systematically, using algebraic manipulation, constraint analysis, and optimization techniques.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we've already expressed the area function in terms of w and determined the constraints on w. The next logical step is to find the valid range for w by solving the inequalities from the length constraints. This will help us identify the domain within which we need to find the maximum area. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. We have the length constraints: 2w \u2264 l \u2264 2w + 5\n2. We know that l = 50 - w (from the perimeter constraint)\n3. Substituting this into the length constraints:\n   2w \u2264 50 - w \u2264 2w + 5\n\n4. We need to solve these inequalities to find the range of w:\n   For the left inequality: 2w \u2264 50 - w\n   For the right inequality: 50 - w \u2264 2w + 5\n\n5. Solving these will give us the valid range for w, which is crucial for finding the maximum area within the given constraints.\n\nThe next operation should focus on solving these inequalities to determine the valid range for w. This will set up the foundation for finding the maximum of the quadratic function A = 50w - w\u00b2 within this range in the subsequent steps.\n",
