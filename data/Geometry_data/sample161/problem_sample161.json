    "problem": "Given a triangle with vertices A(-3, 1), B(4, 5), and C(2, -4), determine the ordinate of the triangle's center of mass.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The centroid of a triangle is the point where the medians intersect. It can be calculated by averaging the coordinates of the vertices. Thus, the centroid G has coordinates: \\[ G\\left(\\frac{-3+4+2}{3}, \\frac{1+5-4}{3}\\right) = G\\left(1, \\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\]. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$",
