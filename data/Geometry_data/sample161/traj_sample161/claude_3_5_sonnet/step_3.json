    "planning_context": "\n1. Review the given information:\n   - Triangle vertices: A(-3, 1), B(4, 5), C(2, -4)\n   - Goal: Find the ordinate (y-coordinate) of the triangle's center of mass\n\n2. Recall the formula for the center of mass of a triangle:\n   - x_cm = (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3\n   - y_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3\n   Where (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) are the coordinates of the three vertices\n\n3. Extract the y-coordinates from the given vertices:\n   - y1 = 1 (from point A)\n   - y2 = 5 (from point B)\n   - y3 = -4 (from point C)\n\n4. Apply the formula for y_cm:\n   y_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3\n   \n5. Substitute the values and perform the calculation:\n   y_cm = (1 + 5 + (-4)) / 3\n\n6. Use a calculator to compute the final result\n\n7. Round the result to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n\n8. Present the final answer as the ordinate of the triangle's center of mass\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection information and our previous steps, we need to revise our approach. Here's the reasoning for the correct solution:\n\n1. We correctly identified the formula for the y-coordinate of the center of mass: y_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3\n\n2. We correctly substituted the values: y_cm = (1 + 5 + (-4)) / 3\n\n3. The calculation (1 + 5 + (-4)) / 3 simplifies to 2/3\n\n4. The fraction 2/3 is the exact and most appropriate form of the answer for this mathematical problem\n\nTherefore, we should conclude that the ordinate (y-coordinate) of the triangle's center of mass is 2/3. This fractional representation is more precise and mathematically sound than the decimal approximation we previously considered.\n\nThe acting agent should present this final answer of 2/3 without any further calculations or conversions.\n",
