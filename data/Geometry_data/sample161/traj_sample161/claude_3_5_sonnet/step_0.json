    "planning_context": "\n1. Review the given information:\n   - Triangle vertices: A(-3, 1), B(4, 5), C(2, -4)\n   - Goal: Find the ordinate (y-coordinate) of the triangle's center of mass\n\n2. Recall the formula for the center of mass of a triangle:\n   - x_cm = (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3\n   - y_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3\n   Where (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) are the coordinates of the three vertices\n\n3. Extract the y-coordinates from the given vertices:\n   - y1 = 1 (from point A)\n   - y2 = 5 (from point B)\n   - y3 = -4 (from point C)\n\n4. Apply the formula for y_cm:\n   y_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3\n   \n5. Substitute the values and perform the calculation:\n   y_cm = (1 + 5 + (-4)) / 3\n\n6. Use a calculator to compute the final result\n\n7. Round the result to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n\n8. Present the final answer as the ordinate of the triangle's center of mass\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo determine the ordinate (y-coordinate) of the triangle's center of mass, we need to focus on applying the formula for y_cm as outlined in the planning strategy. We have already identified the y-coordinates of the three vertices:\n\ny1 = 1 (from point A)\ny2 = 5 (from point B)\ny3 = -4 (from point C)\n\nThe next logical step is to substitute these values into the formula:\n\ny_cm = (y1 + y2 + y3) / 3\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\ny_cm = (1 + 5 + (-4)) / 3\n\nNow, we need to perform this calculation to find the exact value of y_cm. The acting agent should use a calculator to compute this sum and division accurately. After obtaining the result, we may need to consider rounding it to an appropriate number of decimal places, depending on the precision required for the problem.\n",
