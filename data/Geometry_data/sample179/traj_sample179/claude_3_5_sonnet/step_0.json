    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - One angle is 45 degrees\n   - One leg measures 7\u221a2 units\n\n2. Recall key properties of 45-45-90 triangles:\n   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs are equal\n   - The hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg\n\n3. Determine if this is a 45-45-90 triangle:\n   - Since one angle is 45\u00b0 and it's a right triangle, the other non-right angle must also be 45\u00b0\n   - Confirm that this is indeed a 45-45-90 triangle\n\n4. Use the properties of 45-45-90 triangles:\n   - The given leg (7\u221a2) represents both legs of the triangle\n   - No need to find the other leg length\n\n5. Apply the relationship between leg and hypotenuse in a 45-45-90 triangle:\n   - Hypotenuse = leg * \u221a2\n\n6. Calculate the hypotenuse:\n   - Substitute the leg length (7\u221a2) into the formula\n   - Simplify the expression\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the hypotenuse length in simplest form\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the calculated hypotenuse is correct\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have a right triangle with one angle measuring 45 degrees and one leg measuring 7\u221a2 units, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. Since one angle is 45\u00b0 and it's a right triangle, we can deduce that this is a 45-45-90 triangle. In such a triangle, both legs are equal, and we already know one leg's length.\n\n2. The key property we need to use is that in a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg.\n\n3. We have the leg length, which is 7\u221a2 units. To find the hypotenuse, we need to multiply this by \u221a2.\n\n4. The next step should be to calculate 7\u221a2 * \u221a2. This will give us the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n5. After calculating, we should simplify the result if possible to express the hypotenuse length in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 7\u221a2 by \u221a2 and then simplify the result if needed.\n",
