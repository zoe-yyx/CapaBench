    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - One angle is 45 degrees\n   - One leg measures 7\u221a2 units\n\n2. Recall key properties of 45-45-90 triangles:\n   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs are equal\n   - The hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg\n\n3. Determine if this is a 45-45-90 triangle:\n   - Since one angle is 45\u00b0 and it's a right triangle, the other non-right angle must also be 45\u00b0\n   - Confirm that this is indeed a 45-45-90 triangle\n\n4. Use the properties of 45-45-90 triangles:\n   - The given leg (7\u221a2) represents both legs of the triangle\n   - No need to find the other leg length\n\n5. Apply the relationship between leg and hypotenuse in a 45-45-90 triangle:\n   - Hypotenuse = leg * \u221a2\n\n6. Calculate the hypotenuse:\n   - Substitute the leg length (7\u221a2) into the formula\n   - Simplify the expression\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the hypotenuse length in simplest form\n\n8. Verify the result:\n   - Use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the calculated hypotenuse is correct\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result from the previous action, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. The calculation 7\u221a2 * \u221a2 resulted in 14. This is a crucial step in solving our problem.\n\n2. Let's break down what this result means:\n   - We started with a leg length of 7\u221a2 units.\n   - We multiplied this by \u221a2 to find the hypotenuse.\n   - The result is 14, which is our hypotenuse length.\n\n3. This result makes sense because:\n   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the leg length.\n   - 7\u221a2 * \u221a2 = 7 * 2 = 14\n\n4. We now have our answer: the hypotenuse length is 14 units.\n\n5. To verify this result, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - In a right triangle, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse.\n   - We know both legs are 7\u221a2 units (as it's a 45-45-90 triangle).\n   - We should check if (7\u221a2)\u00b2 + (7\u221a2)\u00b2 = 14\u00b2\n\nThe next logical step would be to verify our result using the Pythagorean theorem. This will ensure our solution is correct and complete our problem-solving process.\n",
