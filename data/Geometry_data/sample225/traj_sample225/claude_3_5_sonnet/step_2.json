    "observation": "A hexagon is formed by removing an equilateral triangle of length 1 from each corner of an equilateral triangle. If each side of the original equilateral triangle is 10 cm long, find the total length of all the sides of the hexagon.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Start with an equilateral triangle with side length 10 cm\n   - Imagine removing a smaller equilateral triangle from each corner\n\n2. Identify key information:\n   - Original triangle side length: 10 cm\n   - Removed triangle side length: 1 cm\n\n3. Determine the hexagon's structure:\n   - The hexagon will have 6 sides\n   - 3 sides from the original triangle (but shorter)\n   - 3 sides from the cut corners\n\n4. Calculate the length of one side of the hexagon from the original triangle:\n   - Original side length minus twice the removed triangle's side length\n   - 10 - (2 \u00d7 1) = 8 cm\n\n5. Calculate the total length of the three longer sides:\n   - 3 \u00d7 8 cm\n\n6. Calculate the length of one side from the cut corners:\n   - This is equal to the side length of the removed triangle: 1 cm\n\n7. Calculate the total length of the three shorter sides:\n   - 3 \u00d7 1 cm\n\n8. Sum up the total length of all sides:\n   - Add the results from steps 5 and 7\n\n9. Double-check the calculation and ensure all units are in cm\n\n10. Present the final answer as the total length of all sides of the hexagon\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and current progress, we have successfully calculated the total length of all sides of the hexagon. Let's review and confirm our reasoning:\n\n1. We calculated the length of the longer sides:\n   - Each longer side is 10 cm - (2 \u00d7 1 cm) = 8 cm\n   - Total length of three longer sides = 3 \u00d7 8 cm = 24 cm\n\n2. We calculated the length of the shorter sides:\n   - Each shorter side is 1 cm (the side of the removed equilateral triangle)\n   - Total length of three shorter sides = 3 \u00d7 1 cm = 3 cm\n\n3. We added the lengths of all sides:\n   - Total perimeter = 24 cm + 3 cm = 27 cm\n\nThe calculation 3 * 1 + 24 = 27 confirms that the total length of all sides of the hexagon is 27 cm.\n\nAt this point, we have successfully solved the problem. The next step should be to present the final answer clearly, ensuring that the units (cm) are included.\n\nThe acting agent should formulate a clear and concise answer statement that summarizes the solution to the original problem.\n",
