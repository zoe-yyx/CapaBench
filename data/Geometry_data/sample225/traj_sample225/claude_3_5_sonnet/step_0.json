    "observation": "A hexagon is formed by removing an equilateral triangle of length 1 from each corner of an equilateral triangle. If each side of the original equilateral triangle is 10 cm long, find the total length of all the sides of the hexagon.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Start with an equilateral triangle with side length 10 cm\n   - Imagine removing a smaller equilateral triangle from each corner\n\n2. Identify key information:\n   - Original triangle side length: 10 cm\n   - Removed triangle side length: 1 cm\n\n3. Determine the hexagon's structure:\n   - The hexagon will have 6 sides\n   - 3 sides from the original triangle (but shorter)\n   - 3 sides from the cut corners\n\n4. Calculate the length of one side of the hexagon from the original triangle:\n   - Original side length minus twice the removed triangle's side length\n   - 10 - (2 \u00d7 1) = 8 cm\n\n5. Calculate the total length of the three longer sides:\n   - 3 \u00d7 8 cm\n\n6. Calculate the length of one side from the cut corners:\n   - This is equal to the side length of the removed triangle: 1 cm\n\n7. Calculate the total length of the three shorter sides:\n   - 3 \u00d7 1 cm\n\n8. Sum up the total length of all sides:\n   - Add the results from steps 5 and 7\n\n9. Double-check the calculation and ensure all units are in cm\n\n10. Present the final answer as the total length of all sides of the hexagon\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should guide the acting agent to focus on calculating the lengths of the hexagon's sides. We'll start with the longer sides, which are derived from the original triangle's sides.\n\n1. Calculate the length of one longer side of the hexagon:\n   - Original side length: 10 cm\n   - Removed from each end: 1 cm\n   - Length of one longer side = 10 - (2 \u00d7 1) = 8 cm\n\n2. Calculate the total length of the three longer sides:\n   - Length of one longer side: 8 cm\n   - Number of longer sides: 3\n   - Total length of longer sides = 3 \u00d7 8 cm\n\n3. Identify the length of one shorter side:\n   - This is equal to the side length of the removed triangle: 1 cm\n\n4. Calculate the total length of the three shorter sides:\n   - Length of one shorter side: 1 cm\n   - Number of shorter sides: 3\n   - Total length of shorter sides = 3 \u00d7 1 cm\n\n5. Sum up the total length of all sides:\n   - Add the results from steps 2 and 4\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations accurately, starting with the longer sides, then the shorter sides, and finally summing up all sides to get the total length of the hexagon's perimeter.\n",
