    "observation": "A hexagon is formed by removing an equilateral triangle of length 1 from each corner of an equilateral triangle. If each side of the original equilateral triangle is 10 cm long, find the total length of all the sides of the hexagon.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Start with an equilateral triangle with side length 10 cm\n   - Imagine removing a smaller equilateral triangle from each corner\n\n2. Identify key information:\n   - Original triangle side length: 10 cm\n   - Removed triangle side length: 1 cm\n\n3. Determine the hexagon's structure:\n   - The hexagon will have 6 sides\n   - 3 sides from the original triangle (but shorter)\n   - 3 sides from the cut corners\n\n4. Calculate the length of one side of the hexagon from the original triangle:\n   - Original side length minus twice the removed triangle's side length\n   - 10 - (2 \u00d7 1) = 8 cm\n\n5. Calculate the total length of the three longer sides:\n   - 3 \u00d7 8 cm\n\n6. Calculate the length of one side from the cut corners:\n   - This is equal to the side length of the removed triangle: 1 cm\n\n7. Calculate the total length of the three shorter sides:\n   - 3 \u00d7 1 cm\n\n8. Sum up the total length of all sides:\n   - Add the results from steps 5 and 7\n\n9. Double-check the calculation and ensure all units are in cm\n\n10. Present the final answer as the total length of all sides of the hexagon\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe've successfully calculated the total length of the three longer sides of the hexagon, which is 24 cm. Now, we need to focus on the shorter sides and complete the calculation for the total perimeter of the hexagon.\n\n1. We already know that the length of each shorter side is 1 cm (the side length of the removed equilateral triangle).\n\n2. We need to calculate the total length of the three shorter sides:\n   - Length of one shorter side: 1 cm\n   - Number of shorter sides: 3\n   - Total length of shorter sides = 3 \u00d7 1 cm\n\n3. After calculating the total length of the shorter sides, we'll need to add this to the total length of the longer sides (24 cm) to get the full perimeter of the hexagon.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to:\na) Multiply 3 by 1 to get the total length of the shorter sides\nb) Add the result to 24 cm to get the total perimeter of the hexagon\n",
