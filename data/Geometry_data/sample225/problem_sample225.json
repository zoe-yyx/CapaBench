    "problem": "A hexagon is formed by removing an equilateral triangle of length 1 from each corner of an equilateral triangle. If each side of the original equilateral triangle is 10 cm long, find the total length of all the sides of the hexagon.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The original equilateral triangle has sides of 10 cm, and after removing a smaller triangle with side length 1 cm from each corner, each side of the hexagon becomes 4.5 cm long, resulting in a total length of 6 * 4.5 = 27 cm, so the answer is \\boxed{27}.",
