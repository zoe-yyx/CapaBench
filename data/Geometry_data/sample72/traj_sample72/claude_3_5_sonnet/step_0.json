Identify the key information:\n   - We have a 20-sided polygon\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute n = 20 into the formula\n   - Calculate (20 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\n4. Perform the calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to ensure accuracy\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in degrees\n\n6. Optional: Verify the result\n   - Consider dividing the total by 20 to find the measure of each interior angle\n   - Check if this makes sense for a 20-sided polygon\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 1-2 rounds, as it's a straightforward application of a known formula followed by simple arithmetic.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should proceed with applying the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:\n\nSum = (n - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\nWhere n is the number of sides in the polygon. In this case, we have a 20-sided polygon, so n = 20.\n\nLet's substitute this into the formula:\n\nSum = (20 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\nOur next step should be to perform this calculation. We need to:\n\n1. Subtract 2 from 20\n2. Multiply the result by 180\n\nThis calculation will give us the sum of all interior angles of the 20-sided polygon. \n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation accurately. After obtaining the result, we can express it in degrees as our final answer.\n",
