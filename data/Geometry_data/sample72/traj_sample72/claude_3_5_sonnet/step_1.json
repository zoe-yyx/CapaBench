    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:\n   - Formula: Sum = (n - 2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides\n\n2. Identify the key information:\n   - We have a 20-sided polygon\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute n = 20 into the formula\n   - Calculate (20 - 2) * 180\u00b0\n\n4. Perform the calculation:\n   - Use a calculator if needed to ensure accuracy\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in degrees\n\n6. Optional: Verify the result\n   - Consider dividing the total by 20 to find the measure of each interior angle\n   - Check if this makes sense for a 20-sided polygon\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 1-2 rounds, as it's a straightforward application of a known formula followed by simple arithmetic.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation performed by the acting agent, we now have the result for the sum of all interior angles of a 20-sided polygon. Let's analyze this result:\n\n1. The calculation (20 - 2) * 180 = 3240.00000000000 is correct.\n2. This means the sum of all interior angles of a 20-sided polygon is 3240 degrees.\n\nNow that we have this result, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. The answer seems reasonable, as we expect the sum of interior angles to increase with the number of sides in a polygon.\n2. To further verify this result, we can calculate the measure of each interior angle by dividing the total by the number of sides:\n   3240 \u00f7 20 = 162 degrees per interior angle\n\nThis additional calculation can help us confirm the reasonableness of our answer, as each interior angle of a regular 20-sided polygon (icosagon) should indeed be 162 degrees.\n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to present this final answer clearly, stating both the total sum and, if desired, the measure of each interior angle for additional context.\n",
