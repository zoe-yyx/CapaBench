    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Triangle ABC with point D on side AC\n   - AD:DC = 3:2\n   - Point E on side BC\n   - DE is parallel to AB\n   - Area of triangle CDE is 4\n\n2. Recognize that DE parallel to AB creates similar triangles:\n   - Triangle ABC is similar to triangle CDE\n\n3. Determine the ratio of similarity:\n   - Use the fact that AD:DC = 3:2 to find the ratio of similarity\n   - This ratio will be key in relating the areas of the triangles\n\n4. Apply the area ratio theorem for similar triangles:\n   - The ratio of areas of similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides\n\n5. Set up an equation:\n   - Use the area of CDE (4) and the ratio found in step 3 to create an equation for the area of ABC\n\n6. Solve the equation:\n   - Calculate the area of triangle ABC\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the original proportions\n\n8. If needed, use a calculator for any complex calculations\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on the key geometric relationships and area ratios.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the result from the calculator, we can now proceed with the final steps of our solution. \n\nThe calculator result of 25 confirms our reasoning about the area ratio. Let's break down what this means:\n\n1. We set up the proportion: 4 : x = (2/5)\u00b2\n2. The calculator computed 4 / (2/5)\u00b2 = 25\n\nThis result directly gives us the area of triangle ABC. Here's why:\n\n- The ratio (2/5)\u00b2 represents (Area of CDE) : (Area of ABC)\n- We know the Area of CDE is 4\n- So, 4 : x = (2/5)\u00b2\n- Cross multiplying, we get: x * (2/5)\u00b2 = 4\n- Solving for x: x = 4 / (2/5)\u00b2 = 25\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is 25 square units.\n\nTo verify this result, we can check if it aligns with our original ratio:\n- Area of CDE : Area of ABC = 4 : 25\n- This simplifies to 1 : 6.25\n- The square root of this ratio (\u221a(1/6.25) = 2/5) matches our original side ratio of 2:5\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct and consistent with the given information.\n\nThe acting agent should now state the final answer: The area of triangle ABC is 25 square units.\n",
