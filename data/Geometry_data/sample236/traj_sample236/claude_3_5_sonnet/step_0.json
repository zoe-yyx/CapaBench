    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by focusing on the similarity between triangles ABC and CDE. The key to solving this problem lies in determining the ratio of similarity and then applying the area ratio theorem.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the ratio AD:DC = 3:2. This ratio is crucial because it directly relates to the ratio of similarity between the two triangles. Since D divides AC in the ratio 3:2, we can deduce that:\n\nAD : AC = 3 : 5\nDC : AC = 2 : 5\n\nNow, because DE is parallel to AB, we know that triangle CDE is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of similarity will be the same as the ratio of DC to AC, which is 2:5.\n\nThe next step is to apply the area ratio theorem. This theorem states that the ratio of the areas of similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. \n\nLet's denote the area of triangle ABC as x. We know the area of triangle CDE is 4. We can set up the following proportion:\n\nArea of CDE : Area of ABC = (DC/AC)\u00b2\n4 : x = (2/5)\u00b2\n\nThis proportion will allow us to calculate the area of triangle ABC. The acting agent should use this information to set up and solve an equation to find x.\n",
