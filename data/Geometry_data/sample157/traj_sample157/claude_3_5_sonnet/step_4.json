    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the periodic nature of sine function:\n   - Recall that sine has a period of 360\u00b0.\n   - Understand that we can simplify the angle by adding or subtracting 360\u00b0 without changing the sine value.\n\n2. Simplify the angle:\n   - Divide -405\u00b0 by 360\u00b0 to find how many full rotations are included.\n   - Calculate the remaining angle after removing full rotations.\n\n3. Identify the reference angle:\n   - Determine if the simplified angle is in the first, second, third, or fourth quadrant.\n   - Find the acute reference angle.\n\n4. Determine the sign of the result:\n   - Based on the quadrant, decide if the sine will be positive or negative.\n\n5. Calculate the sine of the reference angle:\n   - Use a calculator or trigonometric identities to find the sine of the reference angle.\n\n6. Apply the sign to the result:\n   - Combine the sign determined in step 4 with the value calculated in step 5.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the final answer makes sense given the original angle.\n   - Confirm that the value is between -1 and 1, as all sine values must be.\n\n8. Express the final answer:\n   - State the computed value of $\\sin(-405\u00b0)$.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the reflection. You're absolutely right that we should express the answer in its exact form for standard angles in trigonometry. Let's adjust our reasoning accordingly:\n\n1. We correctly simplified -405\u00b0 to -45\u00b0, which is in the fourth quadrant.\n2. We recognized that sin(-45\u00b0) = -sin(45\u00b0).\n3. For the standard 45\u00b0 angle, we should recall that sin(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2.\n4. Therefore, sin(-405\u00b0) = sin(-45\u00b0) = -sin(45\u00b0) = -(\u221a2/2).\n\nOur next step should be to express this final answer in its exact form, rather than as a decimal approximation. We should guide the acting agent to present the answer as a fraction involving a square root.\n\nThe acting agent should state the final answer as:\n\nsin(-405\u00b0) = -\u221a2/2\n\nAlternatively, if we want to avoid the square root in the numerator, we could also express it as:\n\nsin(-405\u00b0) = -1/\u221a2\n\nBoth of these forms are equivalent and exact, preserving the precise value without resorting to decimal approximation. This presentation maintains the mathematical elegance and precision expected in trigonometric solutions involving standard angles.\n",
