    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the periodic nature of sine function:\n   - Recall that sine has a period of 360\u00b0.\n   - Understand that we can simplify the angle by adding or subtracting 360\u00b0 without changing the sine value.\n\n2. Simplify the angle:\n   - Divide -405\u00b0 by 360\u00b0 to find how many full rotations are included.\n   - Calculate the remaining angle after removing full rotations.\n\n3. Identify the reference angle:\n   - Determine if the simplified angle is in the first, second, third, or fourth quadrant.\n   - Find the acute reference angle.\n\n4. Determine the sign of the result:\n   - Based on the quadrant, decide if the sine will be positive or negative.\n\n5. Calculate the sine of the reference angle:\n   - Use a calculator or trigonometric identities to find the sine of the reference angle.\n\n6. Apply the sign to the result:\n   - Combine the sign determined in step 4 with the value calculated in step 5.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the final answer makes sense given the original angle.\n   - Confirm that the value is between -1 and 1, as all sine values must be.\n\n8. Express the final answer:\n   - State the computed value of $\\sin(-405\u00b0)$.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the results from our previous calculations, we have made significant progress in solving this problem. Let's analyze our current position and determine the next steps:\n\n1. We have simplified -405\u00b0 to -45\u00b0, which is in the fourth quadrant.\n2. We have calculated sin(45\u00b0) = sin(\u03c0/4) \u2248 0.707106781186548.\n\nNow, our reasoning should focus on finalizing the solution:\n\n1. Since -45\u00b0 is in the fourth quadrant, we know that the sine of this angle is negative.\n2. The sine of a negative angle is equal to the negative of the sine of the positive angle: sin(-\u03b8) = -sin(\u03b8).\n3. Therefore, sin(-45\u00b0) = -sin(45\u00b0).\n\nOur next step is to apply the negative sign to our calculated value of sin(45\u00b0). This will give us our final answer for sin(-405\u00b0).\n\nThe acting agent should now perform the following operation:\nMultiply the previously calculated value of sin(45\u00b0) by -1 to get the final result for sin(-405\u00b0).\n\nThis operation will complete our solution process, giving us the correct value of sin(-405\u00b0).\n",
