    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the periodic nature of sine function:\n   - Recall that sine has a period of 360\u00b0.\n   - Understand that we can simplify the angle by adding or subtracting 360\u00b0 without changing the sine value.\n\n2. Simplify the angle:\n   - Divide -405\u00b0 by 360\u00b0 to find how many full rotations are included.\n   - Calculate the remaining angle after removing full rotations.\n\n3. Identify the reference angle:\n   - Determine if the simplified angle is in the first, second, third, or fourth quadrant.\n   - Find the acute reference angle.\n\n4. Determine the sign of the result:\n   - Based on the quadrant, decide if the sine will be positive or negative.\n\n5. Calculate the sine of the reference angle:\n   - Use a calculator or trigonometric identities to find the sine of the reference angle.\n\n6. Apply the sign to the result:\n   - Combine the sign determined in step 4 with the value calculated in step 5.\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the final answer makes sense given the original angle.\n   - Confirm that the value is between -1 and 1, as all sine values must be.\n\n8. Express the final answer:\n   - State the computed value of $\\sin(-405\u00b0)$.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we are at the beginning of solving this problem, our reasoning should focus on simplifying the angle -405\u00b0 to an equivalent angle within the standard 360\u00b0 range. This is crucial because it will make the subsequent steps easier and more intuitive.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent through the following thought process:\n\n1. We need to simplify -405\u00b0 by adding or subtracting multiples of 360\u00b0 until we get an equivalent angle between -360\u00b0 and 0\u00b0.\n\n2. To do this systematically, we should divide -405 by 360 and focus on the remainder. This will tell us how many full rotations we need to remove and what angle remains.\n\n3. After simplification, we'll need to identify which quadrant this angle falls into, as this will determine the sign of the sine function and help us find the reference angle.\n\n4. Once we have the simplified angle and know its quadrant, we can proceed to find its reference angle and calculate its sine value.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to use a calculator to divide -405 by 360 and determine the remainder. This will give us the simplified angle to work with for the rest of the problem.\n",
