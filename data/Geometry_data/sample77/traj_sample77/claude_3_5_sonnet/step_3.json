    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify known information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - Longer leg = 16 units\n   - Hypotenuse = 20 units\n   - We need to find the length of the shorter leg\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the legs\n\n3. Set up the Pythagorean equation:\n   16\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 20\u00b2, where x is the unknown shorter leg\n\n4. Simplify the known squares:\n   256 + x\u00b2 = 400\n\n5. Isolate x\u00b2:\n   x\u00b2 = 400 - 256\n\n6. Calculate the value of x\u00b2 using a calculator\n\n7. Take the square root of the result to find x\n\n8. Round the answer to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n\n9. Verify the solution by plugging the values back into the Pythagorean theorem\n\n10. Present the final answer: The length of the shorter leg\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, we have successfully set up and simplified the Pythagorean equation. We now have:\n\nx\u00b2 = 144\n\nWhere x represents the length of the shorter leg that we're trying to find.\n\nOur next logical step is to solve for x by taking the square root of both sides of the equation. This operation will give us the actual length of the shorter leg.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to calculate the square root of 144 using a calculator. This will provide us with the value of x, which is the length of the shorter leg we're seeking.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have our answer, but it would be wise to verify the solution by plugging the values back into the original Pythagorean theorem to ensure accuracy.\n",
