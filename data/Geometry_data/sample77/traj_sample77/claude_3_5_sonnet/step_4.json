    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify known information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - Longer leg = 16 units\n   - Hypotenuse = 20 units\n   - We need to find the length of the shorter leg\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the legs\n\n3. Set up the Pythagorean equation:\n   16\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 20\u00b2, where x is the unknown shorter leg\n\n4. Simplify the known squares:\n   256 + x\u00b2 = 400\n\n5. Isolate x\u00b2:\n   x\u00b2 = 400 - 256\n\n6. Calculate the value of x\u00b2 using a calculator\n\n7. Take the square root of the result to find x\n\n8. Round the answer to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n\n9. Verify the solution by plugging the values back into the Pythagorean theorem\n\n10. Present the final answer: The length of the shorter leg\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated the length of the shorter leg, which is 12 units. This result was obtained by taking the square root of 144, which we derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nNow, as per our planning strategy, it's crucial to verify our solution by plugging all the values back into the original Pythagorean theorem. This step will ensure the accuracy of our calculations and confirm that our answer satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\nTo verify, we need to check if:\n\n(shorter leg)\u00b2 + (longer leg)\u00b2 = (hypotenuse)\u00b2\n\nWe know:\n- Shorter leg = 12 units\n- Longer leg = 16 units\n- Hypotenuse = 20 units\n\nTherefore, our next operation should be to calculate:\n\n12\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 = 20\u00b2\n\nIf this equation holds true, it will confirm that our solution is correct.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations and verify if the left side of the equation equals the right side.\n",
