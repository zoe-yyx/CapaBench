    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify known information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - Longer leg = 16 units\n   - Hypotenuse = 20 units\n   - We need to find the length of the shorter leg\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the legs\n\n3. Set up the Pythagorean equation:\n   16\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 20\u00b2, where x is the unknown shorter leg\n\n4. Simplify the known squares:\n   256 + x\u00b2 = 400\n\n5. Isolate x\u00b2:\n   x\u00b2 = 400 - 256\n\n6. Calculate the value of x\u00b2 using a calculator\n\n7. Take the square root of the result to find x\n\n8. Round the answer to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n\n9. Verify the solution by plugging the values back into the Pythagorean theorem\n\n10. Present the final answer: The length of the shorter leg\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we have successfully calculated 16\u00b2 = 256 and 20\u00b2 = 400. Now we can set up the simplified Pythagorean equation:\n\n256 + x\u00b2 = 400\n\nOur next step is to isolate x\u00b2. To do this, we need to subtract 256 from both sides of the equation. This operation will give us:\n\nx\u00b2 = 400 - 256\n\nNow, we need to perform this subtraction to find the value of x\u00b2. This step is crucial as it will bring us closer to determining the length of the shorter leg.\n\nTherefore, the next logical operation is to use a calculator to subtract 256 from 400. This calculation will give us the value of x\u00b2, which represents the square of the length of the shorter leg.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be ready to take the square root of the result to find the actual length of the shorter leg.\n",
