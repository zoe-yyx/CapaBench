    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify known information:\n   - We have a right triangle\n   - Longer leg = 16 units\n   - Hypotenuse = 20 units\n   - We need to find the length of the shorter leg\n\n2. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:\n   a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the legs\n\n3. Set up the Pythagorean equation:\n   16\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 20\u00b2, where x is the unknown shorter leg\n\n4. Simplify the known squares:\n   256 + x\u00b2 = 400\n\n5. Isolate x\u00b2:\n   x\u00b2 = 400 - 256\n\n6. Calculate the value of x\u00b2 using a calculator\n\n7. Take the square root of the result to find x\n\n8. Round the answer to an appropriate number of decimal places if necessary\n\n9. Verify the solution by plugging the values back into the Pythagorean theorem\n\n10. Present the final answer: The length of the shorter leg\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have identified the known information and recalled the Pythagorean theorem, our next logical step is to set up the Pythagorean equation using the known values. We know that the longer leg is 16 units and the hypotenuse is 20 units. Let's denote the unknown shorter leg as x.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, we can set up the equation:\n\n16\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 20\u00b2\n\nThis equation represents the relationship between the three sides of our right triangle. By solving this equation, we will be able to determine the value of x, which is the length of the shorter leg.\n\nThe next operation should focus on simplifying the known squares in this equation. Specifically, we need to calculate 16\u00b2 and 20\u00b2. This will prepare us for isolating x\u00b2 in the subsequent step.\n",
