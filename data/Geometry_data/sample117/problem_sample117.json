    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The maximum area of a rectangle inscribed in a right triangle is when the vertices of the rectangle touch the midpoints of the hypotenuse. The area of such a rectangle is half the area of the triangle. The area of the triangle is 1/2 * 6 * 8 = 24 square units. Therefore, the maximum area of the rectangle is 24/2 = \\boxed{12} square units.",
