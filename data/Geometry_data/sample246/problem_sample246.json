    "problem": "An equilateral triangle with side length 6 cm is rotated about its center by 120 degrees. Calculate the area of the region swept out by this rotation.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The radius of the circumscribed circle of the equilateral triangle is $2\\sqrt{3}$. After rotating 120 degrees, the swept area is exactly the area of the circumscribed circle. Thus the answer is $\\pi \\times (2\\sqrt{3})^2 = \\boxed{12\\pi}$.",
