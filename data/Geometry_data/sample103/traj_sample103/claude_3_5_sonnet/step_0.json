    "planning_context": "\n1. Visualize the problem:\n   - Picture a circle with radius 6 units\n   - Imagine a chord that is 4 units away from the center\n\n2. Identify the key components:\n   - Radius (r) = 6 units\n   - Distance from center to chord (h) = 4 units\n   - Length of the chord (to be calculated)\n\n3. Recall relevant geometric principles:\n   - In a circle, a perpendicular line from the center to a chord bisects the chord\n   - This creates a right triangle\n\n4. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - The right triangle formed has:\n     * Hypotenuse = radius (6 units)\n     * One side = distance from center to chord (4 units)\n     * The other side = half of the chord length\n\n5. Set up the equation:\n   - Let x be half the length of the chord\n   - Use Pythagorean theorem: x^2 + 4^2 = 6^2\n\n6. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify: x^2 + 16 = 36\n   - Subtract 16 from both sides: x^2 = 20\n   - Take the square root of both sides: x = \u221a20\n\n7. Calculate the final result:\n   - The full length of the chord is 2x\n   - Chord length = 2\u221a20\n\n8. Simplify if necessary:\n   - Simplify \u221a20 to 2\u221a5 if needed\n\n9. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the circle's dimensions\n\n10. Present the final answer:\n    - State the chord length in simplified form\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the problem, here's the reasoning to guide the next step:\n\n1. We have identified that we need to use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The key components we have are:\n   - Radius (r) = 6 units\n   - Distance from center to chord (h) = 4 units\n\n2. We need to set up the equation using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's call half the length of the chord 'x'. \n\n3. The equation will be: x^2 + 4^2 = 6^2\n\n4. To proceed, we need to solve this equation for x. This will involve the following steps:\n   a) Simplify the equation\n   b) Isolate x^2\n   c) Take the square root of both sides\n   d) Multiply the result by 2 to get the full chord length\n\n5. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n6. After finding x, we'll need to simplify the result if possible, particularly if it involves a square root.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to set up the Pythagorean theorem equation and solve it step by step using a calculator.\n",
