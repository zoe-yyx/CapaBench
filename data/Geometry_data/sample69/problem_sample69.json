    "problem": "Two sides of a triangle are 4 units and 6 units. What is the maximum possible integer length for the third side?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "According to the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Therefore, 4 + 6 > x implies x < 10. Thus, the maximum possible integer length for the third side is \\boxed{9}.",
