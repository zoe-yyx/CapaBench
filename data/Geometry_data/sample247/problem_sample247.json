    "problem": "A regular hexagon is reflected across one of its diagonals across opposite vertices. How many of the original vertices match with their reflected image?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "In a regular hexagon, a diagonal across opposite vertices divides the hexagon into two equal trapezoids and is a line of symmetry. When the hexagon is reflected across this diagonal, the vertices on the diagonal line (the ends of the diagonal) remain unchanged. Thus, 2 vertices out of the 6 vertices match with their reflected image. \\(\\boxed{2}\\)",
