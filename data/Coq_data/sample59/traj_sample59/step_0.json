    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem \"four_is_even\" states that there exists a number n such that 4 = n + n.\n   - This is essentially asking to prove that 4 is an even number.\n\n2. Identify the key concept:\n   - An even number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of a number with itself.\n\n3. Choose the witness:\n   - We need to find a value for n that satisfies the equation 4 = n + n.\n   - The obvious choice is n = 2, as 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n4. Outline the proof structure:\n   a. Use the 'exists' tactic to introduce the witness (2).\n   b. Simplify the equation to show that 4 = 2 + 2.\n\n5. Proof steps:\n   a. Apply the 'exists 2' tactic to introduce the witness.\n   b. Use 'reflexivity' or 'simpl' to prove that 4 = 2 + 2.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that the proof is complete and Coq accepts it without any remaining goals.\n\n7. Optional optimization:\n   - The proof is straightforward and likely doesn't need further optimization.\n   - However, we could consider using 'lia' (Linear Integer Arithmetic) tactic if we want a more automated approach.\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates a basic example of proving the existence of a number with a certain property.\n   - It also showcases how to work with simple arithmetic equalities in Coq.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe theorem \"four_is_even\" states that there exists a number n such that 4 = n + n. This is a straightforward proof that demonstrates the concept of evenness in integers. \n\nGiven the planning strategy, we should proceed as follows:\n\n1. Use the 'exists' tactic to introduce our witness. The natural choice for n is 2, as 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n2. After introducing the witness, we'll need to prove that 4 is indeed equal to 2 + 2.\n\n3. The equality 4 = 2 + 2 is a simple arithmetic fact that Coq should be able to recognize automatically.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following approach for the acting agent:\n\n1. Start by using the 'exists 2' tactic. This will introduce 2 as our witness for n.\n\n2. After applying 'exists 2', the goal should change to proving that 4 = 2 + 2.\n\n3. For this simple equality, we can use the 'reflexivity' tactic, which should automatically recognize and prove the equality.\n\nIf 'reflexivity' doesn't work for any reason, we could alternatively use the 'simpl' tactic followed by 'reflexivity', or even the 'lia' tactic for a more powerful automated approach.\n\nThis approach directly follows our planning strategy and should provide a concise and clear proof of the theorem.\n",
