    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem requires proving that plus_one 1 = 2.\n   - The plus_one function is defined as x + 1 for any input x of type Z.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   - Unfold the definition of plus_one.\n   - Simplify the resulting expression.\n   - Use basic arithmetic properties of Z.\n\n3. Step-by-step plan:\n   a. Begin the proof.\n   b. Unfold the definition of plus_one using the 'unfold' tactic.\n   c. The goal should now be 1 + 1 = 2.\n   d. Use the 'reflexivity' tactic to prove the equality.\n   e. If 'reflexivity' doesn't work directly, consider using 'simpl' before 'reflexivity'.\n   f. If still unsuccessful, try using the 'lia' tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) from the Psatz library.\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - Once the equality is proven, use 'Qed' to complete the proof.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The problem imports ZArith and Psatz, which provide powerful tactics for integer arithmetic.\n   - If any step fails, consider using 'auto' or 'omega' tactics as alternatives.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no historical actions have been taken yet, we should start by following our planned strategy. The first step is to begin the proof and then unfold the definition of plus_one.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to start the proof by using the 'Proof.' command.\n2. After starting the proof, we should immediately unfold the definition of plus_one using the 'unfold' tactic. This will expose the underlying arithmetic operation.\n3. Unfolding the definition will transform the goal from 'plus_one 1 = 2' to '1 + 1 = 2'.\n4. Once the definition is unfolded, we can proceed with simplification or direct proof tactics in the next step.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin by starting the proof and then using the unfold tactic on plus_one. This will set up the goal in a form that's ready for further simplification or direct proof methods.\n",
