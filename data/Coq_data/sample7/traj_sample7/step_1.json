    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem requires proving that plus_one 1 = 2.\n   - The plus_one function is defined as x + 1 for any input x of type Z.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   - Unfold the definition of plus_one.\n   - Simplify the resulting expression.\n   - Use basic arithmetic properties of Z.\n\n3. Step-by-step plan:\n   a. Begin the proof.\n   b. Unfold the definition of plus_one using the 'unfold' tactic.\n   c. The goal should now be 1 + 1 = 2.\n   d. Use the 'reflexivity' tactic to prove the equality.\n   e. If 'reflexivity' doesn't work directly, consider using 'simpl' before 'reflexivity'.\n   f. If still unsuccessful, try using the 'lia' tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) from the Psatz library.\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - Once the equality is proven, use 'Qed' to complete the proof.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The problem imports ZArith and Psatz, which provide powerful tactics for integer arithmetic.\n   - If any step fails, consider using 'auto' or 'omega' tactics as alternatives.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation, we can see that the 'unfold plus_one' tactic has successfully transformed the goal from 'plus_one 1 = 2' to '1 + 1 = 2'. This aligns perfectly with our planning strategy.\n\nNow, we have a simple arithmetic equality to prove: 1 + 1 = 2. This is a basic fact in integer arithmetic, and Coq should be able to handle it easily.\n\nGiven that we have imported the ZArith and Psatz libraries, which provide powerful tactics for integer arithmetic, we have several options to proceed:\n\n1. We could use the 'reflexivity' tactic, which should be able to solve this simple equality automatically.\n\n2. If 'reflexivity' doesn't work for some reason, we could try the 'simpl' tactic followed by 'reflexivity'.\n\n3. As a more powerful alternative, we could use the 'lia' tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) from the Psatz library, which can solve more complex integer arithmetic problems.\n\nConsidering the simplicity of the current goal, I recommend trying the 'reflexivity' tactic first. If that doesn't work, we can then move on to 'lia'.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in our proof should be to apply the 'reflexivity' tactic.\n",
