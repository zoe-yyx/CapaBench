Unfold definitions:\n   - Unfold the definition of is_fixpoint in the goal\n   - Unfold the definition of Zcomp\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nThe proof attempt so far has failed because we started with tactics that were not applicable at that stage of the proof. We need to begin by properly introducing the variables and hypothesis, and then unfold the necessary definitions. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Use 'intros f x H' to bring the function f, the value x, and the hypothesis H (which states that x is a fixpoint of f) into the context.\n\n2. Unfold the definition of 'is_fixpoint' in both the hypothesis and the goal using 'unfold is_fixpoint in *'. This will make the fixpoint property explicit.\n\n3. Unfold the definition of 'Zcomp' in the goal using 'unfold Zcomp'. This will expand the composition of f with itself.\n\n4. After these steps, the goal should look something like:\n   f (f x) = x\n\n   And we should have a hypothesis H: f x = x\n\n5. We can then use 'rewrite H' to replace 'f x' with 'x' in the goal.\n\n6. After the rewrite, the goal should be exactly the same as our hypothesis H, which we can prove using 'apply H'.\n\nThis approach systematically breaks down the theorem and uses the definitions and hypothesis to construct a valid proof.\n",
