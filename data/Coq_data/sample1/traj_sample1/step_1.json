Understand the problem:\n   - We have two equations representing a system:\n     a) C + R = 35 (total number of animals)\n     b) 2C + 4R = 94 (total number of legs)\n   - We need to prove that C = 23 (number of chickens)\n\n2. Plan the proof steps:\n   a) Introduce the variables C and R\n   b) Introduce the two given equations as hypotheses\n   c) Use algebraic manipulation to solve for C\n   d) Show that C = 23 satisfies both equations\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a) Use 'intros' to bring C, R, and the equations into context\n   b) Substitute the first equation (C + R = 35) into the second equation\n   c) Solve the resulting equation for C\n   d) Verify that C = 23 and R = 12 satisfy both original equations\n   e) Use 'lia' (Linear Integer Arithmetic) tactic to handle algebraic manipulations\n\n4. Key tactics to use:\n   - intros\n   - subst\n   - replace\n   - assert\n   - lia\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring all algebraic steps are properly justified\n   - Handling integer arithmetic in Coq\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After proving C = 23, double-check that it satisfies both original equations\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound and well-justified\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any lemmas that could be extracted to make the proof more modular\n   - Think about how this proof technique could be generalized for similar problems\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have introduced our variables C and R, as well as our hypotheses H1 and H2, we need to manipulate these equations to solve for C. Our goal is to show that C = 23.\n\nLet's start by using H1 to substitute R in H2:\n\n1. From H1, we know that R = 35 - C\n2. We can substitute this into H2\n\nAfter this substitution, we'll have an equation with only C as the variable. We can then solve this equation for C and show that it equals 23.\n\nThe next steps should be:\n\n1. Use the 'replace' tactic to substitute R with (35 - C) in H2\n2. Simplify the resulting equation\n3. Solve for C\n4. Show that C = 23 satisfies this equation\n\nWe'll use the 'lia' tactic to handle the arithmetic operations and prove the equality.\n",
