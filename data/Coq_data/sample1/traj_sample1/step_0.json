Proof strategy:\n   a) Use 'intros' to bring C, R, and the equations into context\n   b) Substitute the first equation (C + R = 35) into the second equation\n   c) Solve the resulting equation for C\n   d) Verify that C = 23 and R = 12 satisfy both original equations\n   e) Use 'lia' (Linear Integer Arithmetic) tactic to handle algebraic manipulations\n\n4.

Potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring all algebraic steps are properly justified\n   - Handling integer arithmetic in Coq\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After proving C = 23, double-check that it satisfies both original equations\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound and well-justified\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any lemmas that could be extracted to make the proof more modular\n   - Think about how this proof technique could be generalized for similar problems\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem \"chickens_and_rabbits\", we should follow the planned strategy. Since we're at the starting point of the proof, our first step should be to introduce the variables and hypotheses into the context.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to introduce the variables C and R, which represent the number of chickens and rabbits respectively.\n2. We also need to introduce the two equations given in the problem statement as hypotheses:\n   - C + R = 35 (total number of animals)\n   - 2 * C + 4 * R = 94 (total number of legs)\n\nThese introductions will set up our proof environment with all the necessary components to proceed with the algebraic manipulations.\n\nThe next logical step after this introduction would be to start manipulating these equations to solve for C. However, for now, we should focus on properly setting up the proof context.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent use the 'intros' tactic to bring C, R, and the two equations into the proof context. This will allow us to reference and work with these variables and hypotheses in subsequent steps of the proof.\n",
