    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem mul_1_l:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that for any natural number n, multiplying 1 (represented as S O) by n equals n.\n   - We have definitions for natural numbers (nat), addition (add), and multiplication (mul).\n   - We also have an admitted lemma add_0_r that states adding 0 to any number on the right gives the same number.\n\n2. Analyze the definition of mul:\n   - The mul function is defined recursively.\n   - For S O (which represents 1), it will match the second case of mul.\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Start with induction on n:\n      - Base case: Prove for n = O\n      - Inductive case: Prove for n = S n', assuming it holds for n'\n\n   b. For the base case (n = O):\n      - Simplify mul (S O) O\n      - Show that it evaluates to O\n\n   c. For the inductive case (n = S n'):\n      - Expand the definition of mul\n      - Use the definition of add\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use the admitted lemma add_0_r if necessary\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce the variable n\n   - induction n: to start the induction on n\n   - simpl: to simplify expressions\n   - rewrite: to use equalities or the induction hypothesis\n   - reflexivity: to prove trivial equalities\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Confirm that the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem mul_1_l, considering the given definitions and the admitted lemma. It breaks down the proof into manageable steps, making it easier for the player to construct a valid proof in Coq.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem mul_1_l, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing the variable n, as it's a universally quantified statement.\n\n2. Initiate induction on n. This is crucial because the multiplication function is defined recursively, and we need to prove the property for all natural numbers.\n\n3. For the base case (n = O):\n   - We need to show that mul (S O) O = O\n   - This should simplify directly based on the definition of mul\n\n4. For the inductive case (n = S n'):\n   - We need to prove that mul (S O) (S n') = S n'\n   - This will involve expanding the definitions of mul and add\n   - We'll likely need to use the induction hypothesis\n\n5. Throughout the proof, we should use simplification tactics to reduce complex expressions and rewrite tactics to apply known equalities or hypotheses.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by introducing n and applying induction. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it did not correctly handle the recursive definition of multiplication and addition for the successor case.\n\nImprovement: We need to unfold the definitions of mul and add explicitly, then use the add_0_r lemma to simplify add n' O to n' before applying the induction hypothesis.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights two key points:\n\n1. The current proof strategy didn't properly account for how mul and add are defined for successor cases. When we reached mul (S O) (S n'), we needed to unfold these definitions manually.\n\n2. We overlooked the use of the add_0_r lemma, which is crucial for simplifying the expression after unfolding the definitions.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. After the induction step, use 'simpl' or explicitly unfold the mul and add functions.\n2. Apply the add_0_r lemma to simplify add n' O to n'.\n3. Then rewrite using the induction hypothesis.\n\nThe acting agent should modify the proof strategy as follows:\n- For the base case: Keep it as is, it's correct.\n- For the inductive case:\n  * Use 'simpl' or 'unfold mul, add'.\n  * Rewrite using add_0_r.\n  * Rewrite using the induction hypothesis (IHn').\n  * Use reflexivity to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach should properly handle the definitions and use all available information to complete the proof successfully.",
