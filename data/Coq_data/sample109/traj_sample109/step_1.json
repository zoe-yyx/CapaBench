Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that for any natural number n, multiplying 1 (represented as S O) by n equals n.\n   - We have definitions for natural numbers (nat), addition (add), and multiplication (mul).\n   - We also have an admitted lemma add_0_r that states adding 0 to any number on the right gives the same number.\n\n2. Analyze the definition of mul:\n   - The mul function is defined recursively.\n   - For S O (which represents 1), it will match the second case of mul.\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Start with induction on n:\n      - Base case: Prove for n = O\n      - Inductive case: Prove for n = S n', assuming it holds for n'\n\n   b. For the base case (n = O):\n      - Simplify mul (S O) O\n      - Show that it evaluates to O\n\n   c. For the inductive case (n = S n'):\n      - Expand the definition of mul\n      - Use the definition of add\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use the admitted lemma add_0_r if necessary\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce the variable n\n   - induction n: to start the induction on n\n   - simpl: to simplify expressions\n   - rewrite: to use equalities or the induction hypothesis\n   - reflexivity: to prove trivial equalities\n\n5. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Confirm that the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem mul_1_l, considering the given definitions and the admitted lemma. It breaks down the proof into manageable steps, making it easier for the player to construct a valid proof in Coq.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the inductive case (n = S n'), we need to carefully unfold the definitions of mul and add, then use the available lemmas and induction hypothesis. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We start with the goal: mul (S O) (S n') = S n'\n\n2. We should first unfold the definition of mul. This will give us:\n   add (S n') (mul O n') = S n'\n\n3. We can simplify mul O n' to O, resulting in:\n   add (S n') O = S n'\n\n4. Now we can apply the add_0_r lemma, which states that for all n, add n O = n. \n   This will simplify our goal to:\n   S n' = S n'\n\n5. At this point, we can use reflexivity to complete the proof.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with the following steps:\n- Use 'simpl.' or 'unfold mul, add.' to expand the definitions.\n- Apply 'rewrite add_0_r.' to use the lemma.\n- Finally, use 'reflexivity.' to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the issues highlighted in the reflection and should lead to a successful proof completion.\n",
