Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any proposition P, the double negation of P is equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Use 'intros P' to introduce the proposition P.\n   - Use 'split' to separate the proof into two parts: (~ ~ P -> P) and (P -> ~ ~ P).\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (~ ~ P -> P):\n   - This direction requires classical logic, as it's not provable in constructive logic.\n   - Use the 'classical_prop' tactics from the imported Classical_Prop library.\n   - Apply the principle of excluded middle (P \\/ ~P).\n   - For each case, derive a contradiction or prove P directly.\n\n4. Prove the reverse direction (P -> ~ ~ P):\n   - This direction is straightforward in constructive logic.\n   - Assume P and ~P, then derive a contradiction.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - Both directions should be proven automatically after applying the appropriate tactics.\n   - Use 'Qed' to complete the proof.\n\nKey considerations:\n- The use of classical logic is crucial for the forward direction.\n- The reverse direction is provable in constructive logic and should be relatively simple.\n- Familiarity with double negation elimination in classical logic will be helpful.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem double_negation_iff, we should follow the planning strategy outlined. Let's start with the following steps:\n\n1. Introduce the proposition P:\n   We should use the 'intros' tactic to bring the universal quantifier into the context.\n\n2. Split the proof into two directions:\n   After introducing P, we should use the 'split' tactic to separate the proof into the two directions of the bi-implication.\n\n3. Start with the forward direction (~ ~ P -> P):\n   This direction requires classical logic, so we should prepare to use tactics from the Classical_Prop library.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start with these initial steps:\n\n1. Use 'intros P' to introduce the proposition P into the context.\n2. Use 'split' to separate the proof into the two directions.\n3. For the forward direction, prepare to use classical reasoning, possibly by applying the principle of excluded middle.\n\nThese steps will set up the structure of the proof and allow us to tackle each direction separately.\n",
