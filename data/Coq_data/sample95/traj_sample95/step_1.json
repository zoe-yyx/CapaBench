    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and the planning strategy, we have successfully split the bidirectional implication into two separate goals. Now, we need to focus on proving each direction individually.\n\nFor the first goal (left-to-right direction):\n1. We need to assume the left side of the implication.\n2. Then, we'll destructure this assumption to get specific x and y values.\n3. Finally, we'll use these values to construct the right side of the implication.\n\nTo achieve this, we should guide the acting agent to:\n1. Use the \"intros\" tactic to introduce the hypothesis for the left side.\n2. Use the \"destruct\" tactic to break down the existential quantifiers.\n3. Use the \"exists\" tactic to construct the right side with the obtained values.\n\nFor the second goal (right-to-left direction), we'll follow a similar process but in reverse order.\n\nLet's start with the first goal. The acting agent should be instructed to use the following tactics in order:\n1. intros H.\n2. destruct H as [x [y H]].\n3. exists y, x.\n4. exact H.\n\nThis sequence of tactics should prove the first direction of the implication.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The current approach incorrectly treated the universally quantified variables as existentially quantified, leading to errors in the proof steps.\n\nImprovement: We should use 'intros' to introduce all universally quantified variables (X, Y, P) before attempting to prove the bidirectional implication, then split the goal into two separate implications to prove each direction individually.\n```\n\nThe reflection identifies that our current approach was fundamentally flawed. We incorrectly tried to destruct the type variables and use 'exists' tactics, which are not appropriate for proving universally quantified statements. \n\nTo improve our proof strategy, we should:\n\n1. Use 'intros' to introduce all universally quantified variables (X, Y, P) into the context.\n2. Use 'split' to separate the bidirectional implication into two goals.\n3. For each direction:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis of the implication.\n   b. Destruct the existential quantifiers in the hypothesis.\n   c. Use 'exists' to construct the conclusion with the appropriate values.\n   d. Prove the final proposition using the destructed hypothesis.\n\nThe acting agent should be instructed to start with these tactics:\n\n1. intros X Y P.\n2. split.\n3. - intros [x [y H]].\n     exists y, x.\n     exact H.\n4. - intros [y [x H]].\n     exists x, y.\n     exact H.\n\nThis approach should correctly handle the universal quantification and prove both directions of the equivalence.",
