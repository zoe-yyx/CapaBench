    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the original problem statement, we need to restructure our approach to prove the theorem correctly. The theorem states a bidirectional implication between two existential statements, where the order of variables is swapped. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should start by introducing all universally quantified variables into our context. This will give us a concrete predicate P to work with.\n\n2. Then, we need to split the bidirectional implication into two separate implications to prove each direction.\n\n3. For the left-to-right direction:\n   a. We'll assume the left side of the implication.\n   b. We'll destruct this assumption to get concrete values for x and y.\n   c. We'll then use these values to prove the right side.\n\n4. For the right-to-left direction:\n   a. We'll assume the right side of the implication.\n   b. We'll destruct this assumption to get concrete values for y and x.\n   c. We'll then use these values to prove the left side.\n\n5. In both directions, after destructing the existential quantifiers, we can directly use the 'exists' tactic to construct the other side, and then use the exact tactic to prove the final proposition.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the universal quantification over X, Y, and P, and properly proves the equivalence of the two existential statements. The acting agent should proceed with these steps to construct a valid proof.\n",
