    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by following the planned structure. The first step is to split the bidirectional implication into two separate implications. This will allow us to prove each direction independently.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. Use the 'split' tactic to separate the bidirectional implication (<->) into two implications.\n2. This will create two subgoals, one for each direction of the implication.\n3. After splitting, we should focus on proving the left-to-right direction first, as per our plan.\n\nThe acting agent should use the 'split' tactic to begin the proof. This will set up the structure for proving both directions of the equivalence.\n\nAfter splitting, we'll need to handle the left-to-right direction. For this, we should:\n1. Introduce the hypothesis for the left side of the implication.\n2. Destruct the existential quantifiers to get concrete values.\n3. Use these values to construct the right side of the implication.\n\nThese steps will be addressed in subsequent reasoning phases after we see the result of the 'split' tactic.\n",
