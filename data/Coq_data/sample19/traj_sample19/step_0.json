    "reasoning": "\nTo prove that the function 'plus_one' is monotonic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin by unfolding the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one'. This will expose the actual goal we need to prove based on these definitions.\n\n2. After unfolding, we'll need to introduce the variables and hypothesis from the definition of 'mono'. This will give us concrete values to work with in our proof.\n\n3. Once we have our variables and hypothesis, we'll need to rewrite the goal using the definition of 'plus_one'. This will transform our goal into a statement about integer inequalities.\n\n4. At this point, our goal should be in a form that can be solved using integer arithmetic properties. The Linear Integer Arithmetic (lia) tactic should be able to handle this automatically.\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, the acting agent should start by unfolding the definitions and introducing the variables. Therefore, the next operation should be to use the 'unfold' tactic followed by the 'intros' tactic.\n",
