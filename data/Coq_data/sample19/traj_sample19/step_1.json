    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof, we have successfully unfolded the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one', and introduced the variables and hypothesis. The current goal is to prove that 'n + 1 <= m + 1', given that 'n <= m'.\n\nThis goal is a straightforward arithmetic inequality that follows directly from the hypothesis. We can solve this using the 'lia' tactic, which is part of the Linear Integer Arithmetic solver. The 'lia' tactic is particularly useful for solving goals involving linear inequalities over integers, which is exactly what we have here.\n\nThe 'lia' tactic will automatically use the hypothesis 'H: n <= m' and apply the necessary arithmetic reasoning to prove that 'n + 1 <= m + 1'.\n\nTherefore, the next step in our proof should be to apply the 'lia' tactic. This single step should complete the proof, as it will solve the remaining goal.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The 'lia' tactic was applied prematurely without first unfolding the definitions and introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses.\n\nImprovement: We should start by unfolding the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one', then introduce the variables and hypothesis before applying the 'lia' tactic.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that we attempted to use the 'lia' tactic too early in the proof process. This tactic is indeed powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals, but it needs the goal to be in the right form to work effectively.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Unfold the definition of 'mono' to expose its internal structure.\n2. Unfold the definition of 'plus_one' to reveal the actual function we're working with.\n3. Introduce the variables n and m, and the hypothesis that n <= m.\n4. Only after these steps should we apply the 'lia' tactic.\n\nBy following this more structured approach, we'll set up the goal in a way that 'lia' can understand and solve. This method ensures that all the necessary information is available and in the correct form for the tactic to work effectively.\n\nFor the next action, we should start with unfolding the definitions. This will give us a clearer view of what we need to prove and allow us to introduce the appropriate variables and hypotheses before attempting to solve the goal.",
