Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that the function 'plus_one' is monotonic (Example plus_one_mono: mono plus_one).\n   - We need to use the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'mono'.\n\n2. Analyze the definitions:\n   - plus_one (x: Z): Z := x + 1\n   - mono (f: Z -> Z): Prop := forall n m, n <= m -> f n <= f m\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a.

Proof outline:\n   - Start with 'unfold mono, plus_one.'\n   - Introduce variables: 'intros n m H.'\n   - Rewrite the goal using the definition of plus_one\n   - The goal should become: n + 1 <= m + 1\n   - Use the hypothesis H: n <= m\n   - Apply integer arithmetic properties\n\n5.

Possible challenges:\n   - Ensuring all necessary libraries are imported (already done in the given code)\n   - Correctly applying the definitions and arithmetic properties\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are solved\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Coq without any errors\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start by unfolding the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one' to reveal the structure of our goal.\n\n2. After unfolding, we should introduce the variables and hypothesis that are part of the 'mono' definition.\n\n3. Once we have the goal in its expanded form with all variables introduced, we can then apply arithmetic reasoning.\n\n4. The 'lia' tactic should be more effective after these steps, as it will have a concrete arithmetic inequality to work with.\n\n5. If 'lia' still doesn't solve the goal immediately, we may need to do some manual rewriting or apply some arithmetic lemmas before using 'lia'.\n\nTherefore, the next proving operation should focus on unfolding definitions and introducing variables. This will set up the goal in a form that's more amenable to automated solving tactics like 'lia'.\n",
