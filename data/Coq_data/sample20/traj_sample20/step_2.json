We need to start the proof properly by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses. This will set up our context correctly.\n\n2. After introducing the variables and hypotheses, we should unfold the definitions of 'mono' and 'Zcomp'. This will allow us to work with their explicit forms.\n\n3. Once the definitions are unfolded, we can then apply the monotonicity properties of f and g in the correct order.\n\n4. Finally, we can use the assumption about the inequality between n and m.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Start the proof with 'Proof.'\n\n2. Use 'intros' to bring all necessary variables and hypotheses into the context:\n   - f and g (the two functions)\n   - Hf (monotonicity of f)\n   - Hg (monotonicity of g)\n   - n and m (the input values)\n   - Hnm (the hypothesis that n <= m)\n\n3. Unfold the definitions of 'mono' and 'Zcomp' using the 'unfold' tactic. This will expose the underlying logical structure we need to work with.\n\n4. Apply the monotonicity of f (Hf) to the goal. This will transform the goal to show that g n <= g m.\n\n5. Apply the monotonicity of g (Hg) to the new goal.\n\n6. Use the 'assumption' tactic to prove the final goal, which should match our hypothesis Hnm.\n\nThis approach should provide a clear path to proving the lemma, addressing the issues we encountered in the previous attempt.\n",
