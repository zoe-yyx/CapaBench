    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully set up the proof, introduced the necessary variables and hypotheses, and unfolded the definitions. Now we need to prove that f (g n) <= f (g m).\n\nTo do this, we can use the monotonicity of both f and g. We know that:\n1. n <= m (from our hypothesis Hnm)\n2. g is monotonic (from Hg)\n3. f is monotonic (from Hf)\n\nOur strategy will be:\n1. First, prove that g n <= g m using the monotonicity of g.\n2. Then, use this result along with the monotonicity of f to prove f (g n) <= f (g m).\n\nTo implement this, we should:\n1. Apply the monotonicity of g to our hypothesis Hnm to get g n <= g m.\n2. Then apply the monotonicity of f to this new inequality.\n\nThe acting agent should use the 'apply' tactic to use the monotonicity properties of f and g. If needed, we might also use the 'transitivity' tactic to chain these inequalities together.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because we tried to use hypotheses (Hf and Hg) that haven't been introduced yet, and we didn't properly set up the proof structure.\n\nImprovement: We need to start the proof by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses, then unfold the definitions before applying the monotonicity properties of f and g.\n```\n\nThe current approach was flawed because we jumped directly into trying to apply hypotheses that weren't yet available in our context. This indicates that we skipped some crucial steps in setting up our proof.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start the proof with the 'Proof.' command.\n2. Introduce the variables and hypotheses using 'intros' tactic.\n3. Unfold the definitions of 'mono' and 'Zcomp' using the 'unfold' tactic.\n4. Only then should we start applying our hypotheses and reasoning about inequalities.\n\nA suggested structure for the next attempt could be:\n\n1. Proof.\n2. intros f g Hf Hg n m Hnm.\n3. unfold mono, Zcomp in *.\n4. apply Hf.\n5. apply Hg.\n6. assumption.\n\nThis structure introduces all necessary variables and hypotheses, unfolds the relevant definitions, and then applies the monotonicity properties in the correct order. The reasoning agent should consider this structure and adjust their plan accordingly. The acting agent should then implement these steps one by one, verifying the state of the proof after each command.",
