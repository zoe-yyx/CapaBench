Choose the proof method:\n   - Induction on n seems appropriate, as the multiplication is defined recursively on n\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros n m\" to introduce the variables\n   - Use \"induction n\" to set up induction on n\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem mul_succ_r, we should follow the plan step by step. Since we're at the starting point, we need to set up the proof structure and introduce the variables.\n\n1. First, we should introduce the variables n and m. This will allow us to work with these variables throughout the proof.\n\n2. After introducing the variables, we should set up induction on n. This is crucial because the multiplication function is defined recursively on n, and induction will allow us to prove the theorem for all natural numbers.\n\n3. Once induction is set up, we'll have two cases to prove: the base case (n = O) and the inductive case (n = S p).\n\n4. For the base case, we'll need to simplify the expressions using the definitions of mul and add. This should lead to a trivial equality.\n\n5. For the inductive case, we'll need to expand the expressions using the definitions of mul and add, and then use the induction hypothesis along with the add_succ_r lemma and add_assoc theorem to manipulate the equations.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by introducing the variables and setting up induction on n. This will provide the framework for the rest of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The inductive step failed because we didn't properly use the induction hypothesis (IHp) to rewrite the goal before applying add_succ_r.\n\nImprovement: We should rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis (IHp) before applying add_succ_r, and then use the associativity of addition (add_assoc) to complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe proof attempt was on the right track, but it stumbled in the inductive case. Let's break down why:\n\n1. We correctly introduced the variables and set up the induction.\n2. The base case was handled correctly with simplification and reflexivity.\n3. In the inductive case, we simplified the goal, which was good.\n4. However, we then tried to rewrite with IHp, which failed because the left-hand side of IHp (mul p (S m)) didn't appear in our goal.\n5. We then applied add_succ_r, which made some progress but didn't complete the proof.\n\nTo improve:\n\n1. After simplification in the inductive case, we should rewrite the goal using IHp. This will replace mul p (S m) with add (mul p m) p.\n2. Then, we can apply add_succ_r as we did before.\n3. Finally, we'll need to use the associativity of addition (add_assoc) to rearrange the terms and complete the proof.\n\nFor the next round, the acting agent should follow these steps:\n\n1. Undo the last two steps (rewrite add_succ_r and the failed reflexivity).\n2. Rewrite the goal using IHp.\n3. Apply add_succ_r.\n4. Use add_assoc to rearrange the terms.\n5. Try reflexivity to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach should lead to a successful completion of the proof.",
