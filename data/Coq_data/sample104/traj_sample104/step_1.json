    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem mul_succ_r:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states: forall n m, mul n (S m) = add (mul n m) n\n   - We need to prove this equality for all natural numbers n and m\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Induction on n seems appropriate, as the multiplication is defined recursively on n\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros n m\" to introduce the variables\n   - Use \"induction n\" to set up induction on n\n\n4. Base case (n = O):\n   - Simplify mul O (S m) and mul O m using the definition of mul\n   - Simplify add O O\n   - The equality should become trivial\n\n5. Inductive case (n = S p):\n   - We need to prove: mul (S p) (S m) = add (mul (S p) m) (S p)\n   - Use the definitions of mul and add to expand both sides\n   - The induction hypothesis will be: mul p (S m) = add (mul p m) p\n\n6. Manipulate the equations:\n   - Use the definition of mul to expand mul (S p) (S m) and mul (S p) m\n   - Use the add_succ_r lemma to rewrite add terms\n   - Use the add_assoc theorem to regroup addition terms\n\n7. Apply the induction hypothesis:\n   - Replace mul p (S m) with add (mul p m) p using the induction hypothesis\n\n8. Finish the proof:\n   - After applying steps 6 and 7, both sides should be identical\n   - Use reflexivity to conclude the proof\n\n9. Verify and conclude:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that the proof is complete for all cases\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof of mul_succ_r, we need to focus on the inductive case. The key is to use the induction hypothesis (IHp) effectively and then apply the necessary lemmas in the correct order. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. First, we need to undo the last two steps that didn't lead to the completion of the proof. This will take us back to the simplified goal in the inductive case.\n\n2. Next, we should rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis (IHp). This will replace mul p (S m) with add (mul p m) p, which is crucial for aligning the left and right sides of the equation.\n\n3. After applying IHp, we can use the add_succ_r lemma. This will help us match the structure of the left-hand side with the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n4. At this point, the terms won't be exactly matching due to the grouping of additions. We need to use the associativity of addition (add_assoc) to rearrange the terms so that they align perfectly.\n\n5. Once the terms are properly aligned, we can use reflexivity to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach systematically transforms the goal using the available hypotheses and lemmas until both sides of the equation are identical, allowing us to conclude the proof with reflexivity.\n",
