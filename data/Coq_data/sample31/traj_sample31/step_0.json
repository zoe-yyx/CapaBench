Break down the proof steps:\n   a) Unfold the definition of tree_example2a.\n   b) Apply the tree_height function to the unfolded tree structure.\n   c) Simplify the expression step by step.\n   d) Show that the final result equals 2.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   - Start with the 'Proof.' command.\n   - Use 'unfold tree_example2a' to expand the tree structure.\n   - Apply 'simpl' to simplify the tree_height calculation.\n   - If needed, use 'rewrite' to apply the definition of Z.max.\n   - Finally, use 'reflexivity' to show that the simplified expression equals 2.\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold\n   - simpl\n   - rewrite\n   - reflexivity\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - Be prepared to unfold the definition of Z.max if necessary.\n   - Watch for any implicit coercions between nat and Z, as the problem uses Z.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - End the proof with 'Qed.'\n\nThis plan should guide the player through a straightforward proof of the theorem, focusing on unfolding definitions and simplifying expressions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem tree_example2a_height, our first step should be to start the proof and then unfold the definition of tree_example2a. This will allow us to see the explicit structure of the tree we're working with.\n\nThe reasoning for this approach is as follows:\n\n1. Starting the proof is necessary to begin our formal demonstration.\n2. Unfolding tree_example2a will reveal its structure, which is crucial for understanding how the tree_height function will evaluate it.\n3. By exposing the tree structure, we set the stage for the subsequent simplification steps that will calculate the height.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin by:\n1. Starting the proof with the 'Proof.' command.\n2. Using the 'unfold' tactic to expand the definition of tree_example2a.\n\nThis will provide a clear starting point for the subsequent steps in our proof, allowing us to see how the tree_height function will be applied to the specific structure of tree_example2a.\n",
