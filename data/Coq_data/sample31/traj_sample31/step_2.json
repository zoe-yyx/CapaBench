Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the height of tree_example2a is 2.\n   - The tree_height function is already defined.\n   - tree_example2a is a specific tree structure given in the problem.\n\n2. Break down the proof steps:\n   a) Unfold the definition of tree_example2a.\n   b) Apply the tree_height function to the unfolded tree structure.\n   c) Simplify the expression step by step.\n   d) Show that the final result equals 2.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   - Start with the 'Proof.' command.\n   - Use 'unfold tree_example2a' to expand the tree structure.\n   - Apply 'simpl' to simplify the tree_height calculation.\n   - If needed, use 'rewrite' to apply the definition of Z.max.\n   - Finally, use 'reflexivity' to show that the simplified expression equals 2.\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold\n   - simpl\n   - rewrite\n   - reflexivity\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - Be prepared to unfold the definition of Z.max if necessary.\n   - Watch for any implicit coercions between nat and Z, as the problem uses Z.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - End the proof with 'Qed.'\n\nThis plan should guide the player through a straightforward proof of the theorem, focusing on unfolding definitions and simplifying expressions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation, we can see that after applying the 'simpl' tactic, the goal has been simplified to '2 = 2'. This is exactly what we want to prove, and it's in a form that can be easily solved with a single tactic.\n\nThe simplification process has effectively unfolded the definition of tree_example2a, applied the tree_height function to it, and computed the result. Now we just need to prove that 2 is indeed equal to 2, which is a trivial equality.\n\nGiven this situation, the most straightforward next step would be to use the 'reflexivity' tactic. This tactic is used to prove goals of the form 'x = x', which is exactly what we have here with '2 = 2'.\n\nTherefore, I recommend instructing the acting agent to use the 'reflexivity' tactic to complete the proof.\n",
