    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem 'not_ex2' involves logical propositions and implication.\n   - It states that for any propositions P and Q, if P is true and not P is true, then Q must be true.\n   - This is an example of the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses.\n   - Identify the contradiction in the hypotheses.\n   - Use the contradiction to prove any arbitrary proposition Q.\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the propositions and hypotheses:\n      - Introduce P and Q as arbitrary propositions.\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that P is true.\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that not P is true.\n   \n   b. Derive a contradiction:\n      - Use the hypotheses P and ~P to obtain a contradiction.\n   \n   c. Use the contradiction to prove Q:\n      - Apply the principle of explosion to conclude Q from the contradiction.\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: To introduce propositions and hypotheses.\n   - contradiction: To derive a contradiction from P and ~P.\n   - exfalso: To switch the goal to False when we have a contradiction.\n   - assumption: To prove the goal if it matches one of our hypotheses.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Recognizing that the contradiction allows us to prove any proposition.\n   - Understanding that no direct proof of Q is needed; the contradiction is sufficient.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are used.\n   - Check that the proof concludes by deriving Q from the contradiction.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we have successfully introduced the propositions P and Q, as well as the hypotheses HP (P is true) and HnP (not P is true). Now, we need to derive a contradiction from these hypotheses and use it to prove Q.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We have contradictory hypotheses HP and HnP. This means we can derive a contradiction.\n2. Once we have a contradiction, we can prove any proposition, including Q, using the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n3. To proceed, we should:\n   a. Explicitly derive the contradiction using the 'contradiction' tactic.\n   b. Use the 'exfalso' tactic to change our goal to False, which we can then prove from the contradiction.\n   c. Finally, use the contradiction to prove Q.\n\nThis approach aligns with our original plan and should lead us directly to proving the theorem. The acting agent should focus on applying these tactics in sequence to complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The 'contradiction' tactic failed because we haven't properly introduced the hypotheses P and ~P into our context.\n\nImprovement: We should start the proof by introducing the variables and hypotheses using 'intros' before attempting to derive a contradiction.\n```\n\nThe current approach was on the right track, but we skipped a crucial step in the proof process. We attempted to use 'exfalso' and 'contradiction' without first introducing the necessary hypotheses into our proof context. This led to the error \"No such contradiction\" because Coq couldn't find the contradictory statements to work with.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Start the proof by using the 'intros' tactic to bring P, Q, and the hypotheses for P and ~P into our context.\n2. After introducing these elements, we can then proceed with the 'exfalso' tactic to change our goal to False.\n3. With the contradictory hypotheses in our context, we can then use the 'contradiction' tactic successfully.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on these steps in sequence:\n1. Use 'intros P Q HP HnP' to introduce all necessary elements.\n2. Then apply 'exfalso'.\n3. Finally, use 'contradiction'.\n\nThis revised approach should allow us to complete the proof successfully by following the logical structure of the theorem and properly setting up our proof context before deriving the contradiction.",
