    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem 'not_ex2' involves logical propositions and implication.\n   - It states that for any propositions P and Q, if P is true and not P is true, then Q must be true.\n   - This is an example of the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses.\n   - Identify the contradiction in the hypotheses.\n   - Use the contradiction to prove any arbitrary proposition Q.\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the propositions and hypotheses:\n      - Introduce P and Q as arbitrary propositions.\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that P is true.\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that not P is true.\n   \n   b. Derive a contradiction:\n      - Use the hypotheses P and ~P to obtain a contradiction.\n   \n   c. Use the contradiction to prove Q:\n      - Apply the principle of explosion to conclude Q from the contradiction.\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: To introduce propositions and hypotheses.\n   - contradiction: To derive a contradiction from P and ~P.\n   - exfalso: To switch the goal to False when we have a contradiction.\n   - assumption: To prove the goal if it matches one of our hypotheses.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Recognizing that the contradiction allows us to prove any proposition.\n   - Understanding that no direct proof of Q is needed; the contradiction is sufficient.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are used.\n   - Check that the proof concludes by deriving Q from the contradiction.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof for the theorem 'not_ex2' requires us to show that given any propositions P and Q, if we have both P and ~P (not P), we can prove Q. This is an instance of the principle of explosion.\n\nOur previous attempt failed because we didn't properly introduce the variables and hypotheses into our proof context. To correct this, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing all the variables and hypotheses using the 'intros' tactic. This will bring P, Q, and the assumptions for P and ~P into our context.\n\n2. Once we have the contradictory hypotheses in our context, we can use 'exfalso' to change our goal to False. This is appropriate because we're dealing with a contradiction.\n\n3. Finally, with the contradictory statements P and ~P in our context, we can use the 'contradiction' tactic to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach aligns with our original plan and addresses the flaw identified in the reflection. By properly setting up our proof context first, we ensure that we have the necessary elements to derive the contradiction and complete the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these tactics in this order:\n1. intros P Q HP HnP\n2. exfalso\n3. contradiction\n\nThis sequence should successfully prove the theorem by deriving a contradiction from the hypotheses and using it to prove any arbitrary proposition Q.\n",
