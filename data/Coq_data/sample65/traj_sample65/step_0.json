Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem 'not_ex2' involves logical propositions and implication.\n   - It states that for any propositions P and Q, if P is true and not P is true, then Q must be true.\n   - This is an example of the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses.\n   - Identify the contradiction in the hypotheses.\n   - Use the contradiction to prove any arbitrary proposition Q.\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the propositions and hypotheses:\n      - Introduce P and Q as arbitrary propositions.\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that P is true.\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that not P is true.\n   \n   b. Derive a contradiction:\n      - Use the hypotheses P and ~P to obtain a contradiction.\n   \n   c. Use the contradiction to prove Q:\n      - Apply the principle of explosion to conclude Q from the contradiction.\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: To introduce propositions and hypotheses.\n   - contradiction: To derive a contradiction from P and ~P.\n   - exfalso: To switch the goal to False when we have a contradiction.\n   - assumption: To prove the goal if it matches one of our hypotheses.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Recognizing that the contradiction allows us to prove any proposition.\n   - Understanding that no direct proof of Q is needed; the contradiction is sufficient.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are used.\n   - Check that the proof concludes by deriving Q from the contradiction.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe theorem 'not_ex2' states that for any propositions P and Q, if P is true and not P is true, then Q must be true. This is an example of the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\nTo begin the proof, we should follow the first step of our plan:\n\n1. Introduce the propositions and hypotheses:\n   - We need to introduce P and Q as arbitrary propositions.\n   - We also need to introduce the hypotheses that P is true and that not P is true.\n\nThis can be achieved using the 'intros' tactic. The 'intros' tactic will bring all the quantified variables and hypotheses into our context, allowing us to work with them.\n\nAfter this step, we will have P and Q as propositions in our context, along with two hypotheses: one stating that P is true, and another stating that not P is true. This will set up the contradiction that we'll use to prove Q.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the 'intros' tactic to start the proof.\n",
