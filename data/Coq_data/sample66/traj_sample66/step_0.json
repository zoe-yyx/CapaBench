    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem not_and_iff:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any propositions P and Q, the negation of their conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of their negations.\n   - We need to prove a bi-implication (<->), which means we'll need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Break down the proof into two main parts:\n   a) Left to right: ~ (P /\\ Q) -> ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n   b) Right to left: ~ P \\/ ~ Q -> ~ (P /\\ Q)\n\n3. For the left to right direction:\n   - Use classical logic (law of excluded middle) to consider cases for P and Q\n   - Show that in each case, the implication holds\n\n4. For the right to left direction:\n   - Use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the left side is false and the right side is true\n   - Derive a contradiction\n\n5. Utilize the following tactics:\n   - intros: to introduce the propositions P and Q\n   - split: to separate the bi-implication into two implications\n   - intros: to introduce the hypothesis for each direction\n   - destruct: to apply the law of excluded middle\n   - left/right: to choose the appropriate side of the disjunction\n   - contradiction: to derive contradictions\n   - apply: to apply known facts or hypotheses\n\n6. Consider using auxiliary lemmas if the proof becomes too complex:\n   - Double negation elimination: ~~P <-> P\n   - De Morgan's law for disjunction: ~(P \\/ Q) <-> ~P /\\ ~Q\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that classical logic is properly applied\n   - Verify that the bi-implication is fully established\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, considering both directions of the bi-implication and suggesting tactics and strategies to complete the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem not_and_iff, we should follow the structure outlined in the planning strategy. Let's start with the following steps:\n\n1. Introduce the propositions P and Q.\n2. Split the bi-implication into two separate implications.\n3. Focus on proving the left-to-right direction first.\n\nReasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Use the 'intros' tactic to introduce P and Q into the context.\n2. Apply the 'split' tactic to separate the bi-implication into two goals.\n3. For the left-to-right direction, we need to prove: ~ (P /\\ Q) -> ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ~ (P /\\ Q)\n   - Use classical logic (law of excluded middle) to consider cases for P\n   - Based on these cases, we'll show that either ~P or ~Q holds\n\nThe acting agent should start by applying these initial tactics to set up the proof structure. After that, we'll focus on the left-to-right direction using classical reasoning.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was incorrect, leading to errors in the application of tactics and the overall structure of the proof.\n\nImprovement: Restructure the proof by focusing on the left-to-right implication first, using classical reasoning to handle the disjunction, and then prove the right-to-left implication separately.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt encountered several issues:\n\n1. The use of `classical_left` and `classical_right` was incorrect in this context. These tactics are not appropriate for this theorem.\n\n2. The proof structure became confused after the initial setup, leading to errors in introducing and using hypotheses.\n\n3. The attempt to destruct hypotheses that weren't properly introduced caused errors.\n\n4. The overall flow of the proof was not clear, mixing attempts at both directions of the bi-implication.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Start with a clear structure for both directions of the bi-implication.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction (~ (P /\\ Q) -> ~ P \\/ ~ Q):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ~ (P /\\ Q)\n   - Use classical reasoning (law of excluded middle) on P\n   - Show that in either case (P or ~P), we can derive ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n\n3. For the right-to-left direction (~ P \\/ ~ Q -> ~ (P /\\ Q)):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n   - Prove ~ (P /\\ Q) by contradiction\n   - Use destruct on the disjunction and show that both cases lead to a contradiction with P /\\ Q\n\n4. Use appropriate tactics like `intros`, `destruct`, `apply`, and `contradiction` instead of relying on `classical_left` or `classical_right`.\n\n5. Ensure each step is properly completed before moving to the next, avoiding partial proofs that lead to confusing state.\n\nBy following this improved structure and using the appropriate tactics, we should be able to complete the proof successfully.",
