    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem not_and_iff:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any propositions P and Q, the negation of their conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of their negations.\n   - We need to prove a bi-implication (<->), which means we'll need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Break down the proof into two main parts:\n   a) Left to right: ~ (P /\\ Q) -> ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n   b) Right to left: ~ P \\/ ~ Q -> ~ (P /\\ Q)\n\n3. For the left to right direction:\n   - Use classical logic (law of excluded middle) to consider cases for P and Q\n   - Show that in each case, the implication holds\n\n4. For the right to left direction:\n   - Use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the left side is false and the right side is true\n   - Derive a contradiction\n\n5. Utilize the following tactics:\n   - intros: to introduce the propositions P and Q\n   - split: to separate the bi-implication into two implications\n   - intros: to introduce the hypothesis for each direction\n   - destruct: to apply the law of excluded middle\n   - left/right: to choose the appropriate side of the disjunction\n   - contradiction: to derive contradictions\n   - apply: to apply known facts or hypotheses\n\n6. Consider using auxiliary lemmas if the proof becomes too complex:\n   - Double negation elimination: ~~P <-> P\n   - De Morgan's law for disjunction: ~(P \\/ Q) <-> ~P /\\ ~Q\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that classical logic is properly applied\n   - Verify that the bi-implication is fully established\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, considering both directions of the bi-implication and suggesting tactics and strategies to complete the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem not_and_iff: forall P Q: Prop, ~ (P /\\ Q) <-> ~ P \\/ ~ Q, we need to restructure our approach. We've already introduced P and Q and split the bi-implication. Now, let's focus on proving each direction separately.\n\nFor the left-to-right direction (~ (P /\\ Q) -> ~ P \\/ ~ Q):\n1. We have the hypothesis H : ~ (P /\\ Q)\n2. We need to use classical reasoning to prove ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n3. Apply the law of excluded middle to P (P \\/ ~P)\n4. For each case, show that it leads to ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n\nFor the right-to-left direction (~ P \\/ ~ Q -> ~ (P /\\ Q)):\n1. Introduce the hypothesis ~ P \\/ ~ Q\n2. Prove ~ (P /\\ Q) by contradiction\n3. Assume P /\\ Q and derive a contradiction using the hypothesis\n\nLet's start by focusing on the left-to-right direction. We should use the tactic 'apply NNPP' (double negation elimination) to set up the classical reasoning, then use 'destruct' to consider the cases P and ~P.\n",
