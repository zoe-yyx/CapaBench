    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Leaf_Node_conflict theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that if Leaf equals Node l v r, then 1 equals 2.\n   - This is a proof by contradiction, as we know 1 â‰  2.\n\n2. Analyze the inductive structure:\n   - The tree type has two constructors: Leaf and Node.\n   - Leaf and Node are distinct constructors.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Start with an intros statement to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n   b. Use the discrimination tactic, which is designed to solve contradictions \n      between different constructors of the same inductive type.\n   c. If discrimination doesn't work directly, we may need to use the inversion tactic \n      to derive the contradiction.\n\n4. Step-by-step plan:\n   - Begin the proof with \"intros l v r H\".\n   - Try \"discriminate H\" to solve the goal immediately.\n   - If that doesn't work, use \"inversion H\" to break down the equality.\n   - The inversion should produce a contradiction, as Leaf and Node are distinct.\n   - This contradiction should allow us to prove anything, including 1 = 2.\n\n5. Possible alternative approaches:\n   - If the above doesn't work, consider using the congruence tactic, which can \n     also handle inequalities between constructors.\n   - As a last resort, we could potentially use the axiom of explosion (ex falso quodlibet) \n     by proving False from the contradictory hypothesis and then using that to prove 1 = 2.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof relies on the fundamental property of inductive types that different \n     constructors produce distinct values.\n   - Understanding this principle is crucial for working with inductive types in Coq.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the Leaf_Node_conflict theorem, our first step should be to introduce the variables and hypothesis into the context. This aligns with the first step of our planned strategy.\n\nThe theorem states: \"forall l v r, Leaf = Node l v r -> 1 = 2\". To begin proving this, we should introduce these variables and the hypothesis into our context. This will allow us to work with them and apply further tactics.\n\nAfter introducing the variables and hypothesis, we should immediately try to use the discriminate tactic. This tactic is specifically designed to solve goals that have an equality between two different constructors of the same inductive type, which is exactly what we have in this case (Leaf and Node are different constructors of the tree type).\n\nIf the discriminate tactic succeeds, it will immediately solve the goal, as it will recognize the contradiction in the hypothesis and use it to prove any conclusion (including 1 = 2).\n\nTherefore, I recommend the acting agent to proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Use the intros tactic to bring the variables and hypothesis into the context.\n2. Immediately follow this with the discriminate tactic on the introduced hypothesis.\n\nThis approach directly implements the first two steps of our proof strategy and should be sufficient to prove the theorem.\n",
