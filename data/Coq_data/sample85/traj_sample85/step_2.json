    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that P /\\ (Q \\/ R) is logically equivalent to (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (<->), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'split' tactic to separate the bidirectional implication into two parts\n   - Prove the forward direction: P /\\ (Q \\/ R) -> (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   - Prove the backward direction: (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R) -> P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis (P /\\ (Q \\/ R))\n   - Destruct the conjunction and disjunction\n   - Use case analysis on (Q \\/ R)\n   - For each case, construct the appropriate disjunction on the right-hand side\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ((P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R))\n   - Use case analysis on this disjunction\n   - For each case, prove P and (Q \\/ R) separately\n   - Combine the results to form the conjunction P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n\n5. Utilize propositional logic tactics:\n   - Make use of tactics like 'intros', 'destruct', 'left', 'right', 'split', and 'assumption'\n   - These tactics will help in manipulating the logical structure of the propositions\n\n6. Consider using classical reasoning:\n   - The theorem is provable in constructive logic, but classical tactics might simplify the proof\n   - 'classical_left' or 'classical_right' could be useful if needed\n\n7. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n   - Use 'Qed' to complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the distributivity of conjunction over disjunction, considering both directions of the equivalence.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start over with the proof, as the current state is not salvageable due to incorrect initial steps.\n\n2. Begin by using the 'split' tactic to separate the bi-implication into two implications:\n   - P /\\ (Q \\/ R) -> (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   - (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R) -> P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n\n3. For the forward direction:\n   - Use 'intros' to bring the hypothesis into context\n   - Use 'destruct' to break down the conjunction and disjunction in the hypothesis\n   - Use 'left' or 'right' to choose the appropriate side of the disjunction in the goal\n   - Use 'split' to prove both parts of the resulting conjunction\n\n4. For the backward direction:\n   - Use 'intros' to bring the hypothesis into context\n   - Use 'destruct' to break down the disjunction in the hypothesis\n   - Use 'split' to separate the conjunction in the goal\n   - Prove each part using the available hypotheses\n\n5. Throughout the proof, use 'assumption' when a goal matches exactly with a hypothesis in context.\n\nThis structured approach will help in correctly proving both directions of the equivalence while properly managing the logical structure of the propositions involved.\n",
