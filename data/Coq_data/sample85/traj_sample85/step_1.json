    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that P /\\ (Q \\/ R) is logically equivalent to (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (<->), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'split' tactic to separate the bidirectional implication into two parts\n   - Prove the forward direction: P /\\ (Q \\/ R) -> (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   - Prove the backward direction: (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R) -> P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis (P /\\ (Q \\/ R))\n   - Destruct the conjunction and disjunction\n   - Use case analysis on (Q \\/ R)\n   - For each case, construct the appropriate disjunction on the right-hand side\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ((P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R))\n   - Use case analysis on this disjunction\n   - For each case, prove P and (Q \\/ R) separately\n   - Combine the results to form the conjunction P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n\n5. Utilize propositional logic tactics:\n   - Make use of tactics like 'intros', 'destruct', 'left', 'right', 'split', and 'assumption'\n   - These tactics will help in manipulating the logical structure of the propositions\n\n6. Consider using classical reasoning:\n   - The theorem is provable in constructive logic, but classical tactics might simplify the proof\n   - 'classical_left' or 'classical_right' could be useful if needed\n\n7. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n   - Use 'Qed' to complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the distributivity of conjunction over disjunction, considering both directions of the equivalence.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We have successfully split the bidirectional implication into two separate goals.\n2. For the first goal (forward direction), we need to prove: P /\\ (Q \\/ R) -> P /\\ Q \\/ P /\\ R\n3. To prove this, we should:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n   b. Destruct this conjunction to get P and (Q \\/ R) as separate hypotheses\n   c. Use case analysis on (Q \\/ R)\n   d. For each case (Q or R), we'll construct the appropriate disjunction on the right-hand side\n4. We can use the following tactics:\n   - 'intros' to introduce the hypothesis\n   - 'destruct' to break down the conjunction and disjunction\n   - 'left' or 'right' to choose the appropriate side of the disjunction in the goal\n   - 'split' to prove the conjunction in each case\n   - 'assumption' to use hypotheses that match our goal\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with introducing the hypothesis and destructing the conjunction and disjunction to set up for the case analysis.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was incorrect from the beginning, as it tried to destruct hypotheses that were not yet introduced and used tactics that weren't applicable at that stage of the proof.\n\nImprovement: We should start by splitting the bi-implication using 'split' tactic, then introduce hypotheses for each direction separately, and use appropriate tactics like 'intros', 'destruct', and 'exists' to construct the proof step by step.\n```\n\nThe main issue here was that the proof attempt started with tactics that were not applicable at the initial state of the theorem. The theorem states a bi-implication (↔) between two propositions, but the proof attempt didn't address this structure correctly.\n\nTo improve:\n1. We should start by splitting the bi-implication into two separate implications using the 'split' tactic.\n2. For each direction, we should introduce the hypotheses properly using 'intros'.\n3. When dealing with conjunctions (∧) and disjunctions (∨), we should use 'destruct' on the hypotheses and 'split' or 'left'/'right' on the goals as appropriate.\n4. We should avoid using 'assumption' until we have the correct hypotheses in context.\n\nThe next steps should focus on correctly structuring the proof and introducing the hypotheses before attempting to prove each part. This will set up a proper foundation for the rest of the proof.",
