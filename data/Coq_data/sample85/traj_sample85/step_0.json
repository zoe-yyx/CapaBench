Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that P /\\ (Q \\/ R) is logically equivalent to (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (<->), so we need to prove both directions\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'split' tactic to separate the bidirectional implication into two parts\n   - Prove the forward direction: P /\\ (Q \\/ R) -> (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   - Prove the backward direction: (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R) -> P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis (P /\\ (Q \\/ R))\n   - Destruct the conjunction and disjunction\n   - Use case analysis on (Q \\/ R)\n   - For each case, construct the appropriate disjunction on the right-hand side\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ((P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R))\n   - Use case analysis on this disjunction\n   - For each case, prove P and (Q \\/ R) separately\n   - Combine the results to form the conjunction P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n\n5. Utilize propositional logic tactics:\n   - Make use of tactics like 'intros', 'destruct', 'left', 'right', 'split', and 'assumption'\n   - These tactics will help in manipulating the logical structure of the propositions\n\n6. Consider using classical reasoning:\n   - The theorem is provable in constructive logic, but classical tactics might simplify the proof\n   - 'classical_left' or 'classical_right' could be useful if needed\n\n7. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n   - Use 'Qed' to complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the distributivity of conjunction over disjunction, considering both directions of the equivalence.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem and_or_distr_l, we should follow the plan laid out in the planning strategy. The first step is to understand the theorem and set up the proof structure.\n\n1. We should start by introducing the variables P, Q, and R as propositions.\n\n2. Then, we need to split the bidirectional implication (<->) into two separate implications. This will allow us to prove each direction independently.\n\n3. For the forward direction (->), we should:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis P /\\ (Q \\/ R)\n   b. Destruct this conjunction to get P and (Q \\/ R) separately\n   c. Use case analysis on (Q \\/ R)\n\n4. For the backward direction (<-), we should:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis (P /\\ Q) \\/ (P /\\ R)\n   b. Use case analysis on this disjunction\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, the acting agent should start by introducing the variables and splitting the bidirectional implication. This can be achieved using the following tactics:\n\n1. intros P Q R : This will introduce the propositions P, Q, and R into the context.\n2. split : This will split the bidirectional implication into two separate goals.\n\nAfter these steps, we'll be ready to tackle each direction of the proof separately.\n",
