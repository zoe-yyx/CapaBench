Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem states that addition is associative for natural numbers.\n   - We need to prove: forall n m p, add n (add m p) = add (add n m) p\n\n2.

Base case: n = O\n   b. Inductive case: n = S n'\n   c. Use the induction hypothesis in the step case\n\n4. Proof Steps:\n   a. Introduce variables:\n      - intros n m p\n   b.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem add_assoc, which states the associativity of addition for natural numbers, we should start by following the planned proof structure. The first step in our plan is to introduce the variables and then perform induction on 'n'.\n\nReasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the variables:\n   We should start by introducing the universally quantified variables n, m, and p. This will set up our proof environment with these variables available for use.\n\n2. Perform induction on n:\n   After introducing the variables, we should immediately apply induction on 'n'. This is because the 'add' function is defined recursively on its first argument, and induction on 'n' will allow us to prove the theorem for all natural numbers.\n\n3. Prepare for base and inductive cases:\n   By applying induction, we'll generate two subgoals: the base case (n = O) and the inductive case (n = S n'). This setup will allow us to prove the theorem for zero and for the successor of any natural number, covering all possibilities.\n\nThese steps align with our planned proof structure and will set a solid foundation for the rest of the proof. The acting agent should be instructed to perform these initial steps to begin the formal proof process.\n",
