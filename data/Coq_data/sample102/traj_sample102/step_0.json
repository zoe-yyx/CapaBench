Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any natural numbers n, m, and p, if (n + p) = (m + p), then n = m, and vice versa.\n   - We have two previously admitted theorems: add_comm and add_cancel_l, which can be useful in our proof.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a) Start with the forward direction (->):\n      - Assume add n p = add m p\n      - Use add_comm to rewrite both sides\n      - Apply add_cancel_l to prove n = m\n   \n   b) Then prove the backward direction (<-):\n      - Assume n = m\n      - Show that this implies add n p = add m p\n\n3. Key steps in the proof:\n   - Use intros to bring n, m, and p into context\n   - Apply iff to split the proof into two directions\n   - For the forward direction:\n     * Use add_comm to rewrite add n p as add p n (and similarly for m)\n     * Apply add_cancel_l\n   - For the backward direction:\n     * Rewrite n with m in the goal\n     * Use reflexivity\n\n4. Potential challenges:\n   - Correctly applying the add_comm and add_cancel_l theorems\n   - Managing the bidirectional nature of the iff statement\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem add_cancel_r, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing the variables n, m, and p into the context. This will allow us to work with these variables in our proof.\n\n2. Apply the iff tactic to split the proof into two directions: the forward implication (->) and the backward implication (<-). This is necessary because we're dealing with an if and only if statement.\n\n3. For the forward direction:\n   a) We'll need to use the add_comm theorem to rewrite both sides of the equality.\n   b) After rewriting, we can apply the add_cancel_l theorem to prove n = m.\n\n4. For the backward direction:\n   a) We'll assume n = m and show that this implies add n p = add m p.\n   b) We can do this by rewriting n with m in the goal and then using reflexivity.\n\nGiven that we're starting from scratch, the first step should be to introduce the variables and split the proof into two directions. Therefore, the acting agent should begin with:\n\n- Use the \"intros\" tactic to bring n, m, and p into the context.\n- Apply the \"iff\" tactic to split the proof into two directions.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof structure and allow us to tackle each direction separately in the subsequent steps.\n",
