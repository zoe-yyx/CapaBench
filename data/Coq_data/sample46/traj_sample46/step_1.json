Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem logic_ex2 involves four propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and three implications.\n   - The goal is to prove P2 /\\ Q2 given the three conditions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start by introducing the universal quantifiers and hypotheses.\n   - Use the given conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 to split it into separate hypotheses.\n   - Plan to prove P2 and Q2 separately, then combine them.\n\n3. Prove P2:\n   - Use the hypothesis (P1 -> P2) and the fact that we have P1 from the split conjunction.\n\n4. Prove Q2:\n   - Similarly, use the hypothesis (Q1 -> Q2) and Q1 from the split conjunction.\n\n5. Combine the proofs:\n   - Use the conjunction introduction tactic to combine P2 and Q2.\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - destruct: to split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1\n   - apply: to use the implication hypotheses\n   - split: for the final conjunction introduction\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Keeping track of the hypotheses after splitting the conjunction\n   - Ensuring all hypotheses are used appropriately\n\n8. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review to ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that no unnecessary steps or assumptions were introduced\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have introduced all the variables and hypotheses, and split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 into separate hypotheses HP1 and HQ1, we can proceed to prove P2 and Q2 separately and then combine them.\n\n1. To prove P2:\n   We have HP1: P1 and H2: P1 -> P2. We can apply H2 to HP1 to get P2.\n\n2. To prove Q2:\n   Similarly, we have HQ1: Q1 and H3: Q1 -> Q2. We can apply H3 to HQ1 to get Q2.\n\n3. After proving both P2 and Q2, we can use the split tactic to combine them into P2 /\\ Q2.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should be:\n\n1. Apply H2 to HP1 to get P2\n2. Apply H3 to HQ1 to get Q2\n3. Use the split tactic to combine P2 and Q2\n\nThis reasoning suggests that we should guide the acting agent to use the apply tactic twice, followed by the split tactic.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it relied on non-existent hypotheses HP1 and HQ1, which were not properly introduced or extracted from the given conjunction P1 /\\ Q1.\n\nImprovement: We should first use the 'intros' tactic to bring all variables and hypotheses into the context, then use 'destruct' to split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 into separate hypotheses before applying the implications and combining the results.\n```\n\nThe current approach was unsuccessful because it assumed the existence of hypotheses that were not actually available in the proof context. This highlights the importance of properly introducing and managing hypotheses throughout the proof process.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Start by using the 'intros' tactic to bring all quantified variables and hypotheses into the proof context.\n2. Use the 'destruct' tactic on the P1 /\\ Q1 hypothesis to split it into two separate hypotheses.\n3. Apply the implications (P1 -> P2) and (Q1 -> Q2) to the appropriate hypotheses.\n4. Use the 'split' tactic to prove P2 /\\ Q2 by addressing each conjunct separately.\n\nThese steps will ensure that we have the correct hypotheses available and that we're using them properly to construct our proof. By following this more structured approach, we can avoid errors related to non-existent hypotheses and build a valid proof for the theorem.",
