Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem logic_ex2 involves four propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and three implications.\n   - The goal is to prove P2 /\\ Q2 given the three conditions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start by introducing the universal quantifiers and hypotheses.\n   - Use the given conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 to split it into separate hypotheses.\n   - Plan to prove P2 and Q2 separately, then combine them.\n\n3. Prove P2:\n   - Use the hypothesis (P1 -> P2) and the fact that we have P1 from the split conjunction.\n\n4. Prove Q2:\n   - Similarly, use the hypothesis (Q1 -> Q2) and Q1 from the split conjunction.\n\n5. Combine the proofs:\n   - Use the conjunction introduction tactic to combine P2 and Q2.\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - destruct: to split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1\n   - apply: to use the implication hypotheses\n   - split: for the final conjunction introduction\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Keeping track of the hypotheses after splitting the conjunction\n   - Ensuring all hypotheses are used appropriately\n\n8. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review to ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that no unnecessary steps or assumptions were introduced\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operations:\n\n1. We need to start fresh by introducing all variables and hypotheses into the context. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring in P1, Q1, P2, Q2, and the three hypotheses.\n\n2. After introducing the hypotheses, we should split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 into separate hypotheses. Use the 'destruct' tactic on the hypothesis containing P1 /\\ Q1.\n\n3. Now that we have separate hypotheses for P1 and Q1, we can apply the implications. Use the 'apply' tactic with the appropriate hypothesis (P1 -> P2) to the P1 hypothesis, and similarly for (Q1 -> Q2) to the Q1 hypothesis.\n\n4. Finally, we can prove P2 /\\ Q2 by using the 'split' tactic and then proving each part separately using the results from step 3.\n\nThis approach will systematically break down the problem, ensure all necessary hypotheses are available, and construct the proof in a logical manner.\n",
