Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem logic_ex2 involves four propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and three implications.\n   - The goal is to prove P2 /\\ Q2 given the three conditions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start by introducing the universal quantifiers and hypotheses.\n   - Use the given conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 to split it into separate hypotheses.\n   - Plan to prove P2 and Q2 separately, then combine them.\n\n3. Prove P2:\n   - Use the hypothesis (P1 -> P2) and the fact that we have P1 from the split conjunction.\n\n4. Prove Q2:\n   - Similarly, use the hypothesis (Q1 -> Q2) and Q1 from the split conjunction.\n\n5. Combine the proofs:\n   - Use the conjunction introduction tactic to combine P2 and Q2.\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - destruct: to split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1\n   - apply: to use the implication hypotheses\n   - split: for the final conjunction introduction\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Keeping track of the hypotheses after splitting the conjunction\n   - Ensuring all hypotheses are used appropriately\n\n8. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, review to ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that no unnecessary steps or assumptions were introduced\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first steps should focus on setting up the proof environment and introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses. Following the planning strategy, we should:\n\n1. Introduce the universal quantifiers (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) as variables in our proof context.\n2. Introduce the three given hypotheses:\n   - H1: P1 /\\ Q1\n   - H2: P1 -> P2\n   - H3: Q1 -> Q2\n\n3. Split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1 into separate hypotheses. This will give us direct access to P1 and Q1, which we'll need to prove P2 and Q2.\n\n4. After these initial steps, we'll be in a good position to start proving P2 and Q2 separately.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on these introductory steps using the appropriate tactics. Specifically, they should use:\n- The 'intros' tactic to bring in the variables and hypotheses.\n- The 'destruct' tactic (or a similar one) to split the conjunction P1 /\\ Q1.\n\nOnce these steps are completed, we'll have a clearer proof state to work with for the next phases of the proof.\n",
