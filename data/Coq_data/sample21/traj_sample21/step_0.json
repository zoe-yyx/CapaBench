    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem plus_assoc:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that addition (+) is associative for integers (Z).\n   - We need to use the definition of 'assoc' provided.\n\n2. Unfold the Definition:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of addition.\n   - This will give us the actual statement we need to prove.\n\n3. Set Up the Proof:\n   - Use 'intros' to bring the universal quantifiers (x, y, z) into the context.\n\n4. Simplify the Goal:\n   - The goal should now be in the form: x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z\n   - This is the standard form of the associativity property for addition.\n\n5. Use Built-in Tactics:\n   - Coq has built-in knowledge about integer arithmetic.\n   - Try using 'ring' tactic, which is powerful for proving algebraic equalities.\n   - If 'ring' doesn't work, consider using 'lia' (Linear Integer Arithmetic) tactic.\n\n6. Alternative Approach (if needed):\n   - If automated tactics don't work, we may need to use the properties of Z addition explicitly.\n   - This would involve using lemmas about Z addition from the ZArith library.\n\n7. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Once the equality is proven, use 'Qed' to complete the proof.\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - After completing the proof, consider if there are any insights gained that could be useful for similar proofs in the future.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem plus_assoc, and considering our planning strategy, we should start by addressing the first few steps of our plan:\n\n1. We need to unfold the definition of 'assoc' to expose the actual statement we're proving. This will give us a clear view of what needs to be shown for addition.\n\n2. After unfolding, we should introduce the variables x, y, and z into our context. This will allow us to work with these variables directly in our proof.\n\n3. Once the variables are introduced, we should have a goal that looks like:\n   x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z\n\n4. At this point, we can leverage Coq's built-in knowledge about integer arithmetic. The 'ring' tactic is particularly well-suited for proving algebraic equalities like associativity.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following sequence of actions for the acting agent:\n\n1. Use the 'unfold' tactic to expand the definition of 'assoc'.\n2. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring x, y, and z into the context.\n3. Try the 'ring' tactic to prove the equality automatically.\n\nThis approach should provide a straightforward and efficient proof of the associativity of addition for integers.\n",
