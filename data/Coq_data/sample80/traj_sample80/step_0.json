Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem or_comm states that for any two propositions P and Q, if P or Q is true, then Q or P is also true.\n   - This is essentially proving the commutativity of the logical OR operation.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to bring P, Q, and the hypothesis (P \\/ Q) into the context.\n   - Apply a proof by cases (destruct) on the hypothesis (P \\/ Q).\n   - For each case, prove that Q \\/ P holds.\n\n3. Detailed steps:\n   a. Start with 'intros P Q H' to introduce the propositions and hypothesis.\n   b. Use 'destruct H' to split the proof into two cases:\n      - Case 1: P is true\n      - Case 2: Q is true\n   c. For the case where P is true:\n      - Use 'right' tactic to prove Q \\/ P by showing P is true.\n   d. For the case where Q is true:\n      - Use 'left' tactic to prove Q \\/ P by showing Q is true.\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - The destruct tactic should automatically complete the proof after handling both cases.\n   - If not, use 'Qed' to finish the proof.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - This proof doesn't require any of the imported libraries, but they might be useful for more complex theorems later.\n   - The proof is straightforward and doesn't require any advanced tactics or lemmas.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof for the theorem or_comm has not yet begun, so we need to start with the basic structure of the proof as outlined in the planning strategy. The first step is to introduce the propositions P and Q, as well as the hypothesis (P \\/ Q) into the context. This will set up the proof environment and allow us to work with these elements.\n\nThe next logical step would be to use the destruct tactic on the hypothesis to split the proof into two cases: one where P is true, and another where Q is true. This approach aligns with the structure of the OR operation and will allow us to handle each possibility separately.\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, the acting agent should focus on these initial steps:\n\n1. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring P, Q, and the hypothesis into the context.\n2. Apply the 'destruct' tactic on the hypothesis to split the proof into two cases.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof structure and prepare for the case-by-case analysis that follows. After these steps, we'll be in a position to prove Q \\/ P for each case individually.\n",
