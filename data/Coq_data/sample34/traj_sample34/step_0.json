Unfold the definition of tree_example0 using the 'unfold' tactic. This will replace tree_example0 with its actual definition (Node Leaf 1 Leaf).\n\n3. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation by applying the tree_reverse function. We can use the 'simpl' tactic for this purpose. This will apply the tree_reverse function to the unfolded tree_example0.\n\n4. After simplification, both sides of the equation should be identical (Node Leaf 1 Leaf). At this point, we can use the 'reflexivity' tactic to prove the equality.\n\n5. Finally, end the proof with the 'Qed.' command.\n\nThis straightforward approach should be sufficient to prove the theorem, as it's a simple case involving a tree with only one node and two leaves. No induction or complex reasoning is required for this proof.\n",
