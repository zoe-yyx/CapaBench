    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that the height of a reversed tree is equal to the height of the original tree.\n   - We are working with a custom tree data structure and two recursive functions: tree_reverse and tree_height.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the tree structure and the functions involved, structural induction on the tree 't' is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin with 'intros t' to introduce the tree variable.\n   - Use 'induction t' to start the structural induction on 't'.\n\n4. Base case (Leaf):\n   - For the Leaf case, both sides of the equation should simplify to 0.\n   - Use simpl or cbn to reduce both sides.\n   - The base case should be trivial and can be solved with reflexivity.\n\n5. Inductive case (Node):\n   - For the Node case, we need to consider a tree of the form (Node l v r).\n   - The goal will involve tree_height and tree_reverse applied to this structure.\n\n6. Simplify the goal:\n   - Use simpl or cbn to unfold the definitions of tree_height and tree_reverse.\n   - This should result in an equation involving max functions.\n\n7. Use the induction hypotheses:\n   - We will have two induction hypotheses, one for the left subtree (l) and one for the right subtree (r).\n   - Rewrite using these hypotheses to simplify the goal further.\n\n8. Prove the equality:\n   - After rewriting, the left and right sides of the equation should be identical.\n   - Use reflexivity or congruence to complete the proof.\n\n9. QED:\n   - Once all cases are proved, the theorem should be complete.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- If the proof doesn't go through immediately, consider using assert to prove intermediate steps.\n- The Z.max function might require some properties to be proved separately. Be prepared to use lia or omega for arithmetic reasoning if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe first step in our proof should be to set up the induction on the tree structure. Given that we're dealing with a recursive definition of trees and functions operating on them, structural induction is the most appropriate approach.\n\nWe should start by introducing the tree variable and then applying induction:\n\n1. Introduce the variable 't' using 'intros t'.\n2. Apply structural induction on 't' using 'induction t'.\n\nThis will generate two cases for us to prove:\n\n1. The base case for Leaf\n2. The inductive case for Node\n\nFor the Leaf case, both sides of the equation should simplify to 0, so it should be straightforward to prove. \n\nFor the Node case, we'll need to use the induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees. We'll also need to simplify the definitions of tree_height and tree_reverse.\n\nLet's start with these steps and see how the proof develops. If we encounter any difficulties, we can adjust our approach based on the resulting goal.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof fails because Z.max(a, b) is not automatically recognized as equal to Z.max(b, a) by Coq's reflexivity tactic.\n\nImprovement: We need to prove that Z.max is commutative and apply this property before using reflexivity in the Node case.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt was close, but it overlooked an important detail about the Z.max function. While we humans know that the maximum of two numbers is the same regardless of their order, Coq requires an explicit proof of this fact.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. First, prove a lemma about the commutativity of Z.max. This can be done using the Z.max_comm theorem from the ZArith library.\n\n2. In the Node case of our main proof, after simplifying and rewriting with the induction hypotheses, we should apply our new lemma about Z.max commutativity.\n\n3. Only then should we use the reflexivity tactic, which should now succeed.\n\nHere's a suggested approach for the next steps:\n\n1. Before the main theorem, prove a lemma:\n   ```coq\n   Lemma Z_max_comm : forall a b, Z.max a b = Z.max b a.\n   Proof.\n     intros. apply Z.max_comm.\n   Qed.\n   ```\n\n2. In the Node case of the main proof, after the rewrites, add:\n   ```coq\n   rewrite Z_max_comm.\n   ```\n\n3. Then use reflexivity.\n\nThis approach should allow us to complete the proof without using 'Admitted', ensuring a rigorous and complete proof of the target theorem.",
