    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that the height of a reversed tree is equal to the height of the original tree.\n   - We are working with a custom tree data structure and two recursive functions: tree_reverse and tree_height.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the tree structure and the functions involved, structural induction on the tree 't' is the most appropriate approach.\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin with 'intros t' to introduce the tree variable.\n   - Use 'induction t' to start the structural induction on 't'.\n\n4. Base case (Leaf):\n   - For the Leaf case, both sides of the equation should simplify to 0.\n   - Use simpl or cbn to reduce both sides.\n   - The base case should be trivial and can be solved with reflexivity.\n\n5. Inductive case (Node):\n   - For the Node case, we need to consider a tree of the form (Node l v r).\n   - The goal will involve tree_height and tree_reverse applied to this structure.\n\n6. Simplify the goal:\n   - Use simpl or cbn to unfold the definitions of tree_height and tree_reverse.\n   - This should result in an equation involving max functions.\n\n7. Use the induction hypotheses:\n   - We will have two induction hypotheses, one for the left subtree (l) and one for the right subtree (r).\n   - Rewrite using these hypotheses to simplify the goal further.\n\n8. Prove the equality:\n   - After rewriting, the left and right sides of the equation should be identical.\n   - Use reflexivity or congruence to complete the proof.\n\n9. QED:\n   - Once all cases are proved, the theorem should be complete.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- If the proof doesn't go through immediately, consider using assert to prove intermediate steps.\n- The Z.max function might require some properties to be proved separately. Be prepared to use lia or omega for arithmetic reasoning if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, but we've encountered a subtle issue with the Z.max function. The current goal is:\n\nZ.max (tree_height t2) (tree_height t1) + 1 =\nZ.max (tree_height t1) (tree_height t2) + 1\n\nWhile these expressions are mathematically equivalent, Coq's reflexivity tactic doesn't automatically recognize this equality. To resolve this, we need to prove and apply the commutativity of Z.max. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. First, we need to prove a lemma about Z.max commutativity. This lemma already exists in the ZArith library as Z.max_comm, so we can use it directly.\n\n2. In the current Node case of our main proof, after the simplification and rewrites with induction hypotheses, we should apply the Z.max_comm theorem to one side of the equation.\n\n3. After applying Z.max_comm, the two sides of the equation will be identical, and we can complete the proof with reflexivity.\n\nThese steps will allow us to complete the proof rigorously without using 'Admitted'. The acting agent should focus on applying Z.max_comm and then using reflexivity to finish the proof.\n",
