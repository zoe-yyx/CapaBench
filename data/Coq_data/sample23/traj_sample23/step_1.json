    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof, we have successfully unfolded the definitions and introduced the necessary variables and hypotheses. Now, we need to prove that f n + 1 <= f m + 1, given that n <= m and f is monotonic.\n\nThe reasoning for the next steps should be:\n\n1. Apply the monotonicity property of f:\n   We know that n <= m (from H_nm), so we can apply H_mono to get f n <= f m.\n\n2. Use arithmetic reasoning:\n   If f n <= f m, then adding 1 to both sides preserves the inequality.\n   So, f n + 1 <= f m + 1.\n\n3. These steps should be sufficient to prove the goal.\n\nThe acting agent should be guided to apply the monotonicity property and then use arithmetic reasoning to complete the proof. The lia tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) can be particularly useful for the arithmetic reasoning part.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it tried to use variables and hypotheses that were not properly introduced or available in the current context.\n\nImprovement: We need to start by unfolding the definitions and introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses before attempting to apply specific tactics or make assertions.\n```\n\nThe current approach jumped directly into trying to assert a property of f and use the lia tactic without properly setting up the proof context. This led to errors because the variables and hypotheses were not available.\n\nTo improve the proving process, we should:\n\n1. Begin by unfolding the definition of preserved_by_shifting_up and mono.\n2. Introduce the necessary variables and hypotheses.\n3. Clearly state the goal we're trying to prove after the introductions.\n4. Then proceed with the logical steps of the proof, ensuring each step is properly justified.\n\nThe next reasoning and action steps should focus on setting up the proof structure correctly before attempting to prove specific properties or use advanced tactics. This will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent steps of the proof.",
