    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem mono_pu, we should start by unfolding the definitions involved and introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses. This will set up the structure of our proof and allow us to work with the concrete terms.\n\n1. First, we should unfold the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_up'. This will give us the specific property we need to prove for 'mono'.\n\n2. Next, we should unfold the definition of 'mono' itself. This will show us what we need to prove about the shifted function.\n\n3. After unfolding these definitions, we should introduce the variables and hypotheses that arise from these definitions. We'll likely have:\n   - A function f\n   - A hypothesis that f is monotonic\n   - Two integers n and m\n   - A hypothesis that n <= m\n\n4. Our goal will then be to show that (shift_up1 f n) <= (shift_up1 f m).\n\n5. To prove this, we should unfold the definition of shift_up1. This will allow us to work with the explicit form of the shifted function.\n\n6. Once we have the expanded form, we can use the monotonicity of f (which we have as a hypothesis) to show that f n <= f m.\n\n7. From there, we can use basic arithmetic reasoning to show that adding 1 to both sides preserves the inequality.\n\n8. Finally, we can use tactics like 'lia' or 'omega' to handle the arithmetic reasoning and complete the proof.\n\nThis approach breaks down the proof into manageable steps, starting from the definitions and working towards the goal in a logical manner. It allows us to leverage the given hypotheses and definitions effectively to prove the required property.\n",
