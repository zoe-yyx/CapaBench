    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start by unfolding the definitions of 'preserved_by_shifting_up' and 'mono'. This will give us the concrete goal we need to prove.\n\n2. After unfolding, we should introduce the necessary variables and hypotheses. This will likely include:\n   - A function f\n   - The hypothesis that f is monotonic\n   - Two arbitrary integers n and m\n   - The hypothesis that n <= m\n\n3. Once these are introduced, we need to show that (shift_up1 f) is monotonic. This means proving:\n   (shift_up1 f) n <= (shift_up1 f) m\n\n4. To prove this, we should:\n   a. Unfold the definition of shift_up1\n   b. Apply the monotonicity property of f\n   c. Use basic arithmetic reasoning on inequalities\n\n5. The proof structure should look something like this:\n   - unfold preserved_by_shifting_up, mono.\n   - intros f H_mono n m H_nm.\n   - unfold shift_up1.\n   - apply the monotonicity of f\n   - use lia or omega for arithmetic reasoning\n\nThis approach sets up the proof correctly and provides a clear path to proving the theorem.\n",
