    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for smul_ex2:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that smul 2 3 = 11.\n   - We need to use the definition of smul provided.\n\n2. Unpack the Definition:\n   - Recall the definition of smul: smul x y := x * y + x + y\n   - For our case, x = 2 and y = 3\n\n3. Calculation Strategy:\n   - Substitute the values into the smul formula\n   - Perform the arithmetic operations step by step\n\n4. Proof Structure:\n   - Begin the proof\n   - Unfold the definition of smul\n   - Simplify the arithmetic expression\n   - Show that the result equals 11\n\n5. Tactics to Consider:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of smul\n   - simpl: To simplify arithmetic expressions\n   - reflexivity: To check equality\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the calculation is correct\n   - Confirm that the final result matches the expected outcome (11)\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Once the equality is shown, the proof should be complete\n\nThis plan provides a straightforward approach to proving the example, focusing on unpacking the definition and performing the necessary arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem smul_ex2, which states that smul 2 3 = 11, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin the proof by stating the theorem.\n\n2. Unfold the definition of smul. This will expose the underlying arithmetic expression for smul 2 3.\n\n3. After unfolding, we'll have an arithmetic expression that needs to be simplified. The expression should be:\n   2 * 3 + 2 + 3\n\n4. Simplify this expression step by step:\n   - First, calculate 2 * 3 = 6\n   - Then, add 2 to get 8\n   - Finally, add 3 to get 11\n\n5. Once we've simplified the expression to 11, we can use reflexivity to prove that it equals 11, which is what we need to show.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by beginning the proof and then unfolding the definition of smul. This will set up the arithmetic expression that needs to be simplified in subsequent steps.\n",
