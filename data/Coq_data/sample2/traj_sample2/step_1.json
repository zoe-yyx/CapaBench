    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the teachers_and_children theorem:\n\n1. Analyze the given conditions:\n   - We have 4 variables: MT (Male Teachers), FT (Female Teachers), MC (Male Children), FC (Female Children)\n   - All variables are positive integers\n   - The total number of people is 16\n   - There are more children than teachers\n   - There are more female teachers than female children\n   - There are more female children than male children\n   - There are more male children than male teachers\n   - We need to prove that MT (Male Teachers) = 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'intros' to bring all variables and hypotheses into the context\n   - Name each hypothesis for easier reference\n\n3. Develop inequalities:\n   - Use the given conditions to establish a chain of inequalities: MT < MC < FC < FT\n\n4. Exploit the total sum constraint:\n   - Use the fact that MT + FT + MC + FC = 16\n   - Combined with the inequalities, this limits the possible values for each variable\n\n5. Prove by contradiction:\n   - Assume MT ≠ 1 (i.e., MT ≥ 2, since MT > 0)\n   - Show that this assumption leads to a contradiction with the other constraints\n\n6. Use algebraic manipulation:\n   - Leverage the inequalities and the sum constraint to show that if MT ≥ 2, the total sum would exceed 16\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction will show that the assumption MT ≠ 1 is false\n   - Therefore, MT must equal 1\n\n8. Use Lia tactic:\n   - The problem involves linear integer arithmetic\n   - The Lia tactic from the Psatz library can be powerful for solving such inequalities\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove that under the given conditions, the number of male teachers must be 1. The key is to carefully use the given inequalities and the sum constraint to narrow down the possible values for each variable.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to establish the chain of inequalities step by step. Let's start by asserting and proving each inequality separately:\n\n   - Assert: MT < MC\n     Proof: This follows directly from hypothesis H_MC_MT.\n\n   - Assert: MC < FC\n     Proof: This follows directly from hypothesis H_FC_MC.\n\n   - Assert: FC < FT\n     Proof: This follows directly from hypothesis H_FT_FC.\n\n2. After establishing these inequalities, we can use them to narrow down the possible values for each variable, considering that their sum must equal 16 (from H_sum).\n\n3. To prove MT = 1, we can use a proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume MT ≥ 2 (since we know MT > 0 from H_MT_pos)\n   - Use the established inequalities to show that if MT ≥ 2, then MC ≥ 3, FC ≥ 4, and FT ≥ 5\n   - Sum these minimum values: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14\n   - This leaves only 2 to distribute among the four variables to reach the sum of 16\n   - However, increasing any variable by 1 would violate the strict inequalities we established\n   - This contradiction proves that our assumption (MT ≥ 2) must be false\n\n4. After establishing this contradiction, we can conclude that MT must equal 1, as it's the only positive integer less than 2.\n\n5. The 'lia' tactic from the Psatz library may be helpful in proving these arithmetic relations and inequalities.\n",
