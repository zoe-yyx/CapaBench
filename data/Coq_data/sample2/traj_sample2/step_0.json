    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for the teachers_and_children theorem:\n\n1. Analyze the given conditions:\n   - We have 4 variables: MT (Male Teachers), FT (Female Teachers), MC (Male Children), FC (Female Children)\n   - All variables are positive integers\n   - The total number of people is 16\n   - There are more children than teachers\n   - There are more female teachers than female children\n   - There are more female children than male children\n   - There are more male children than male teachers\n   - We need to prove that MT (Male Teachers) = 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'intros' to bring all variables and hypotheses into the context\n   - Name each hypothesis for easier reference\n\n3. Develop inequalities:\n   - Use the given conditions to establish a chain of inequalities: MT < MC < FC < FT\n\n4. Exploit the total sum constraint:\n   - Use the fact that MT + FT + MC + FC = 16\n   - Combined with the inequalities, this limits the possible values for each variable\n\n5. Prove by contradiction:\n   - Assume MT ≠ 1 (i.e., MT ≥ 2, since MT > 0)\n   - Show that this assumption leads to a contradiction with the other constraints\n\n6. Use algebraic manipulation:\n   - Leverage the inequalities and the sum constraint to show that if MT ≥ 2, the total sum would exceed 16\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction will show that the assumption MT ≠ 1 is false\n   - Therefore, MT must equal 1\n\n8. Use Lia tactic:\n   - The problem involves linear integer arithmetic\n   - The Lia tactic from the Psatz library can be powerful for solving such inequalities\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove that under the given conditions, the number of male teachers must be 1. The key is to carefully use the given inequalities and the sum constraint to narrow down the possible values for each variable.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem, we should follow the initial steps of the planning strategy:\n\n1. Set up the proof by introducing all variables and hypotheses into the context. This will allow us to work with the given conditions more easily.\n\n2. Name each hypothesis for clearer reference in the subsequent steps. This will make it easier to use these hypotheses in our reasoning.\n\n3. Establish the chain of inequalities (MT < MC < FC < FT) based on the given conditions. This will be crucial for narrowing down the possible values for each variable.\n\n4. Use the total sum constraint (MT + FT + MC + FC = 16) in conjunction with the inequalities to start limiting the possible values for each variable.\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, the acting agent should start by introducing the variables and hypotheses, and then naming them for easier reference. This will set up a solid foundation for the subsequent reasoning steps.\n\nAfter this initial setup, we can begin to develop the inequalities and work towards the contradiction proof as outlined in the planning strategy.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The attempt to establish the chain of inequalities (MT < MC < FC < FT) was incorrectly formulated and executed.\n\nImprovement: Restructure the assertion of the inequality chain by breaking it down into separate, simpler assertions that can be proven individually using the available hypotheses.\n```\n\nThe current approach encountered several issues:\n\n1. The assertion `H_chain: MT < MC < FC < FT` was not properly formatted for Coq. Complex inequalities like this need to be broken down.\n\n2. The subsequent proof attempts (split, transitivity) were not applicable to the goal of proving MT = 1.\n\n3. The use of curly braces `{}` to open a new proof block was unnecessary and led to confusion.\n\nTo improve the proof process:\n\n1. Instead of asserting the entire chain at once, we should prove each inequality separately:\n   - Assert and prove: MT < MC (using H_MC_MT)\n   - Assert and prove: MC < FC (using H_FC_MC)\n   - Assert and prove: FC < FT (using H_FT_FC)\n\n2. After establishing these inequalities, we should focus on using the sum constraint (H_sum) along with the inequalities to narrow down the possible values for MT.\n\n3. We should avoid opening unnecessary proof blocks and instead focus on direct assertions and proofs.\n\n4. Consider using tactics like `lia` (Linear Integer Arithmetic) to help with proving inequalities and arithmetic relations.\n\nIn the next steps, the acting agent should focus on asserting and proving these individual inequalities, then use them in conjunction with the sum constraint to progress towards proving MT = 1.",
