Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two propositions P and Q, if P /\\ Q is true, then Q /\\ P is also true.\n   - This is essentially stating the commutativity of the logical AND operation.\n\n2. Outline the proof structure:\n   a. Start with an intros statement to bring P, Q, and the hypothesis into the context.\n   b. Use destruct on the hypothesis to separate P and Q.\n   c. Use the split tactic to prove both parts of the new conjunction Q /\\ P.\n\n3. Detailed steps:\n   a. intros P Q H.\n      - This will introduce P and Q as propositions and H as the hypothesis P /\\ Q.\n   b. destruct H as [HP HQ].\n      - This will break down the hypothesis H into its components, HP : P and HQ : Q.\n   c. split.\n      - This will generate two subgoals: Q and P.\n   d. For the first subgoal (Q), apply HQ directly.\n   e. For the second subgoal (P), apply HP directly.\n\n4. Finalize the proof:\n   - Use Qed to complete the proof.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - This proof is straightforward and doesn't require any complex tactics or lemmas.\n   - The key insight is recognizing that we need to deconstruct the given conjunction and then reconstruct it in the opposite order.\n   - No external libraries or admitted theorems are necessary for this proof.\n\nBy following this plan, the player should be able to construct a concise and clear proof of the and_comm theorem, demonstrating the commutativity of logical AND.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and our planning strategy, we have successfully introduced the propositions P and Q, as well as the hypothesis H (P /\\ Q) into our context. This aligns with step 2a of our plan.\n\nThe next logical step in our proof is to deconstruct the hypothesis H into its components. This will give us separate hypotheses for P and Q, which we can then use to construct our goal Q /\\ P.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning for the next step is:\n\n1. We should use the destruct tactic on H to separate it into its component parts.\n2. This will give us two new hypotheses, one for P and one for Q.\n3. After this step, we'll be in a position to use these individual hypotheses to prove our goal Q /\\ P.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with step 2b of our original plan and sets us up for the subsequent steps of splitting the goal and proving each part separately.\n",
