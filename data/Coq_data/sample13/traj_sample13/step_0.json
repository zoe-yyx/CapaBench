Understand the given definitions:\n   - Recall the definition of 'square': square x = x * x\n   - Recall the definition of 'shift_left1': shift_left1 f x = f (x + 1)\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - The goal is to prove: shift_left1 square x = (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n   - This needs to be proven for all x\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with 'intros x' to introduce the variable x\n   b. Unfold the definition of 'shift_left1'\n   c. Unfold the definition of 'square' inside shift_left1\n   d. Simplify the resulting expression\n   e. Show that the simplified expression equals (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'unfold' to expand definitions\n   - Use 'simpl' for basic simplifications\n   - Use 'reflexivity' to prove equality if the expressions are identical\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplifications\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure that all definitions are properly unfolded\n   - Be careful with parentheses and order of operations\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are solved\n   - Check that the proof is complete and Qed is accepted\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned steps. The first step is to introduce the variable x, which is universally quantified in the theorem statement.\n\nAfter that, we need to unfold the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'square' to make progress. This will allow us to work with the actual expressions rather than the function names.\n\nOnce the definitions are unfolded, we should be able to see an expression that can be simplified to match the right-hand side of the equality we're trying to prove.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the following sequence of actions for the acting agent:\n\n1. Introduce the variable x using the 'intros' tactic.\n2. Unfold the definition of 'shift_left1' using the 'unfold' tactic.\n3. Unfold the definition of 'square' using the 'unfold' tactic again.\n4. Use the 'simpl' tactic to perform any basic simplifications.\n\nAfter these steps, we should be in a good position to evaluate the current goal and determine if further simplification or direct proof is possible.\n",
