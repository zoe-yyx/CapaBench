Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of 'mono', 'shift_left1', and 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   - Ensure clear understanding of how these concepts relate to each other.\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The theorem 'mono_pl' states that monotonicity is preserved by shifting left.\n   - This means we need to prove that if a function is monotonic, its left-shifted version is also monotonic.\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'.\n   b. Introduce the necessary hypotheses:\n      - A function f that is monotonic\n      - Two arbitrary integers n and m, where n <= m\n   c. Show that (shift_left1 f) n <= (shift_left1 f) m\n\n4. Proof strategy:\n   a. Unfold the definition of 'shift_left1' for both sides of the inequality.\n   b. Apply the monotonicity of f (given in the hypothesis) to prove the inequality.\n   c. Use arithmetic properties of integers to handle the \"+1\" in shift_left1.\n\n5. Key steps:\n   - Use the 'unfold' tactic to expand definitions when necessary.\n   - Apply the monotonicity property of f from the hypothesis.\n   - Utilize Z.add_le_mono or similar lemmas to handle inequalities with addition.\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring all definitions are properly unfolded at the right time.\n   - Correctly applying the monotonicity property of f to the shifted function.\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - Ensure that the final step clearly shows (shift_left1 f) n <= (shift_left1 f) m.\n   - This will complete the proof that monotonicity is preserved by shifting left.\n\n8. Verification:\n   - Double-check that all hypotheses are used and no additional assumptions were made.\n   - Ensure the proof follows logically from the given definitions and properties.\n",

This will give us the precise statement we need to prove.\n\n2. After unfolding, we'll need to introduce the necessary hypotheses:\n   - A function f that is monotonic\n   - Two arbitrary integers n and m, where n <= m\n\n3. Our goal will then be to prove that (shift_left1 f) n <= (shift_left1 f) m.\n\n4. To prove this, we'll need to:\n   a. Unfold the definition of 'shift_left1'\n   b. Apply the monotonicity property of f (which we'll have as a hypothesis)\n   c. Use arithmetic properties of Z to handle the \"+1\" in shift_left1\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by unfolding the definition of 'preserved_by_shifting_left' and then introduce the necessary hypotheses. This will set up the proof structure and allow us to work towards showing that monotonicity is preserved when shifting left.\n",
