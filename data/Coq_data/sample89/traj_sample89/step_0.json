    "reasoning": "\nBased on the problem description and the planning strategy, we can guide the acting agent to start proving the theorem. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Begin by introducing all the variables and hypotheses into the context. This will allow us to work with them throughout the proof.\n\n2. The main goal is to prove a logical equivalence (P1 /\\ Q1 <-> P2 /\\ Q2). Logical equivalences are typically proven by showing both directions of the implication. Therefore, we should use the \"split\" tactic to break down the main goal into two subgoals: (P1 /\\ Q1 -> P2 /\\ Q2) and (P2 /\\ Q2 -> P1 /\\ Q1).\n\n3. For the first subgoal (P1 /\\ Q1 -> P2 /\\ Q2):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis (P1 /\\ Q1) into the context.\n   - Deconstruct this hypothesis to get individual assertions for P1 and Q1.\n   - Use the given hypotheses H1 and H2 to transform P1 to P2 and Q1 to Q2.\n   - Combine the transformed assertions to prove P2 /\\ Q2.\n\n4. The second subgoal (P2 /\\ Q2 -> P1 /\\ Q1) can be approached similarly, but in the reverse direction.\n\n5. Throughout the proof, we may need to use tactics like \"apply\" to use the hypotheses H1 and H2, and \"split\" to prove conjunctions.\n\nThis reasoning provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, following the planned strategy and addressing the bidirectional nature of the logical equivalence.\n",
