Plan for the forward direction (->):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis (P \\/ Q -> R)\n   b. Split the goal into two parts: (P -> R) and (Q -> R)\n   c. For each part:\n      - Assume the antecedent (P or Q)\n      - Use the disjunction introduction to create (P \\/ Q)\n      - Apply the original hypothesis to derive R\n\n3. Plan for the backward direction (<-):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)\n   b. Assume (P \\/ Q)\n   c.

Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce hypotheses and variables\n   - split: to handle conjunctions in the goal\n   - apply: to use hypotheses and implications\n   - destruct: for case analysis on disjunctions\n   - assumption: to solve goals that match hypotheses\n   - tauto: might solve some logical steps automatically\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start over with the proof, as the current state is not salvageable due to multiple errors.\n\n2.

For the forward direction (->):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: intros H.\n   - Split the conjunction: split.\n   - For P -> R: \n     * Introduce P: intros HP.\n     * Apply H: apply H.\n     * Use 'left' to prove P \\/ Q: left. exact HP.\n   - For Q -> R:\n     * Introduce Q: intros HQ.\n     * Apply H: apply H.\n     * Use 'right' to prove P \\/ Q: right. exact HQ.\n\n5. For the backward direction (<-):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: intros [HP HQ].\n   - Introduce P \\/ Q: intros [P | Q].\n   - For P case: apply HP. exact P.\n   - For Q case: apply HQ. exact Q.\n\nThis structured approach should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to incorrect handling of variables and hypotheses in the backward direction of the bi-implication.\n\nImprovement: Restructure the backward direction proof by introducing the hypotheses correctly and using pattern matching on P \\/ Q to handle both cases separately.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that while the forward direction of the proof was successful, the backward direction encountered issues. The main problems were:\n\n1. Incorrect introduction of hypotheses: The attempt to introduce [HP HQ] and [P | Q] simultaneously caused conflicts with existing variable names.\n\n2. Improper structure: The proof structure for the backward direction wasn't set up correctly, leading to errors when trying to apply hypotheses that weren't in scope.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Introduce the hypotheses for the backward direction separately and with distinct names to avoid conflicts.\n\n2. Use pattern matching on P \\/ Q after introducing it as a separate hypothesis.\n\n3. Apply the correct hypothesis (HP or HQ) based on whether we're in the P or Q case of the disjunction.\n\nHere's a suggested structure for the backward direction:\n\n- intros H PorQ.\n  destruct H as [HP HQ].\n  destruct PorQ as [P | Q].\n  + apply HP. exact P.\n  + apply HQ. exact Q.\n\nThis structure should allow for a more systematic and error-free approach to completing the proof. It clearly separates the introduction of hypotheses and handles both cases of the disjunction properly.",
