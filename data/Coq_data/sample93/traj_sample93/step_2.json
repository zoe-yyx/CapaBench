Plan for the forward direction (->):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis (P \\/ Q -> R)\n   b. Split the goal into two parts: (P -> R) and (Q -> R)\n   c. For each part:\n      - Assume the antecedent (P or Q)\n      - Use the disjunction introduction to create (P \\/ Q)\n      - Apply the original hypothesis to derive R\n\n3.

    "reasoning": "\nThe forward direction of the proof has been successfully completed. For the backward direction, we need to restructure our approach. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to prove: (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R) -> P \\/ Q -> R\n\n2. To do this, we should:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis for (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)\n   b. Introduce a hypothesis for P \\/ Q\n   c. Use destruct to break down these hypotheses\n   d. Apply the appropriate implication based on whether we have P or Q\n\n3. Suggested proof structure:\n   - intros H PorQ.\n   - destruct H as [HP HQ].\n   - destruct PorQ as [P' | Q'].\n   + apply HP. exact P'.\n   + apply HQ. exact Q'.\n\n4. This structure allows us to:\n   - Clearly separate the introduction of hypotheses\n   - Avoid naming conflicts with the original P and Q\n   - Handle both cases of the disjunction properly\n   - Apply the correct hypothesis in each case\n\n5. By following this structure, we should be able to complete the proof without encountering the previous errors.\n\nThe acting agent should implement this proof structure step by step, ensuring each tactic is applied correctly before moving to the next one.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was incorrect, as it attempted to destruct hypotheses that were not inductive definitions, leading to errors in the proof process.\n\nImprovement: We need to restructure the proof by starting with 'intros' to bring all variables into the context, then use 'split' to handle the bi-implication, and finally prove each direction separately using appropriate tactics for implications and disjunctions.\n```\n\nThe current approach encountered several issues:\n\n1. We tried to destruct 'H' and 'PorQ' as if they were inductive definitions, which they are not. These are propositional variables, not disjunctions or conjunctions.\n\n2. The naming of variables 'H' and 'PorQ' was confusing and did not align with the original theorem statement.\n\n3. We attempted to use tactics (apply, exact) with variables that were not in the context, resulting in errors.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Start by introducing all variables from the theorem statement into the context.\n\n2. Use 'split' to separate the bi-implication into two implications.\n\n3. For the forward direction, introduce the hypothesis for (P \\/ Q -> R) and prove (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R).\n\n4. For the backward direction, introduce the hypothesis for (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R) and prove (P \\/ Q -> R).\n\n5. Use appropriate tactics for handling implications and disjunctions, such as 'intros', 'apply', and 'destruct'.\n\n6. Ensure that all variables used in tactics are properly introduced and in the context.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should implement this revised strategy, starting with the proper introduction of variables and then addressing each direction of the bi-implication separately.",
