    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by following the first steps of our planning strategy. The theorem is a bi-implication, so we need to prove both directions. Let's begin with the forward direction (->).\n\nReasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should start by introducing the variables P, Q, and R, as well as the hypothesis for the left side of the bi-implication.\n\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we need to focus on proving the right side of the bi-implication, which is a conjunction (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R).\n\n3. To prove a conjunction, we typically use the 'split' tactic, which will give us two subgoals to prove: (P -> R) and (Q -> R).\n\n4. For each of these subgoals, we'll need to assume the antecedent (P or Q respectively) and then prove R.\n\n5. To prove R in each case, we can use the original hypothesis (P \\/ Q -> R) by constructing the appropriate disjunction.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I recommend the acting agent to start with the following steps:\n\n1. Use 'intros' to bring P, Q, R, and the hypothesis into the context.\n2. Use 'split' to separate the conjunction in the goal.\n3. For the first subgoal (P -> R), use 'intros' again to assume P.\n4. Then, apply the original hypothesis, using 'apply' with the appropriate disjunction construction.\n\nThese steps will set up the structure for proving the forward direction of the bi-implication.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was incorrect, as it attempted to use tactics and introduce hypotheses without properly setting up the theorem structure first.\n\nImprovement: We need to start by introducing the variables P, Q, and R, then use 'split' to handle the bi-implication, and finally tackle each direction separately using appropriate intros and tactics.\n```\n\nReflection:\n\n1. The main issue in our approach was that we jumped directly into proving without properly setting up the theorem structure. We tried to introduce hypotheses that weren't available yet, which led to multiple errors.\n\n2. We missed the crucial step of introducing the variables P, Q, and R at the beginning, which is necessary before we can work with them in the proof.\n\n3. The use of 'split' was correct, but it was applied too early. We should have introduced the variables first.\n\n4. The attempts to use 'left', 'right', and 'assumption' were premature and out of context, as we hadn't properly set up the proof structure yet.\n\n5. We didn't properly handle the bi-implication nature of the theorem, which requires proving both directions.\n\nFor the next steps, I suggest the following strategy:\n\n1. Start by introducing the variables: 'intros P Q R'.\n2. Use 'split' to separate the bi-implication into two implications to prove.\n3. For the forward direction, introduce the hypothesis: 'intros H'.\n4. Use 'split' again to handle the conjunction in the conclusion.\n5. For each part of the conjunction, introduce the appropriate hypothesis (P or Q) and then use the original hypothesis H to prove R.\n6. For the backward direction, introduce the hypothesis for (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R), then prove P \\/ Q -> R.\n\nThis approach should provide a more structured and correct way to tackle the theorem.",
