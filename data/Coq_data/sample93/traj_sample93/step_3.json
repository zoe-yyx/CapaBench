Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a bi-implication (<->), so we'll need to prove both directions.\n   - The left side is (P \\/ Q -> R)\n   - The right side is (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)\n\n2. Plan for the forward direction (->):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis (P \\/ Q -> R)\n   b. Split the goal into two parts: (P -> R) and (Q -> R)\n   c. For each part:\n      - Assume the antecedent (P or Q)\n      - Use the disjunction introduction to create (P \\/ Q)\n      - Apply the original hypothesis to derive R\n\n3. Plan for the backward direction (<-):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis (P -> R) /\\ (Q -> R)\n   b. Assume (P \\/ Q)\n   c. Use case analysis on (P \\/ Q):\n      - For the P case: apply (P -> R) from the hypothesis\n      - For the Q case: apply (Q -> R) from the hypothesis\n   d. Conclude R in both cases\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce hypotheses and variables\n   - split: to handle conjunctions in the goal\n   - apply: to use hypotheses and implications\n   - destruct: for case analysis on disjunctions\n   - assumption: to solve goals that match hypotheses\n   - tauto: might solve some logical steps automatically\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Managing multiple hypotheses and goals\n   - Correctly applying the disjunction elimination principle\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that no assumptions are left unproven\n",
