    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem 'imply_congr' involves four propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and two implications.\n   - The goal is to prove that (P1 -> Q1) is equivalent to (P2 -> Q2), given that P1 is equivalent to P2 and Q1 is equivalent to Q2.\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'intros' tactic to introduce the propositions and hypotheses into the context.\n   - Apply the 'split' tactic to break down the bi-implication (<->) into two parts.\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (->):\n   - Introduce the assumption (P1 -> Q1) and the proposition P2.\n   - Use the given equivalences to transform P2 into P1.\n   - Apply the assumption (P1 -> Q1) to get Q1.\n   - Use the given equivalence to transform Q1 into Q2.\n\n4. Prove the backward direction (<-):\n   - Follow a similar approach as the forward direction, but start with (P2 -> Q2) and P1.\n   - Use the equivalences in the opposite direction.\n\n5. Use classical logic if needed:\n   - The imported 'Classical_Prop' library might be useful if classical reasoning is required.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use the 'Qed' tactic to complete the proof.\n\nNote: This problem likely doesn't require the use of ZArith or Psatz libraries, but they're available if needed for any arithmetic reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the initial steps of our plan:\n\n1. Introduce the propositions and hypotheses:\n   We should use the 'intros' tactic to bring all the propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and the given equivalences into our context. This will set up our proof environment with all the necessary assumptions.\n\n2. Split the bi-implication:\n   After introducing the variables, we should use the 'split' tactic to break down the main bi-implication (<->) into two separate implications. This will create two subgoals: one for the forward direction (P1 -> Q1) -> (P2 -> Q2), and one for the backward direction (P2 -> Q2) -> (P1 -> Q1).\n\nThese steps will provide a solid foundation for the rest of the proof, allowing us to tackle each direction of the implication separately. The acting agent should focus on implementing these initial steps to set up the proof structure.\n",
