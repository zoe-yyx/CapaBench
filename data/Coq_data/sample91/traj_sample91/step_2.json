    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem 'imply_congr' involves four propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and two implications.\n   - The goal is to prove that (P1 -> Q1) is equivalent to (P2 -> Q2), given that P1 is equivalent to P2 and Q1 is equivalent to Q2.\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'intros' tactic to introduce the propositions and hypotheses into the context.\n   - Apply the 'split' tactic to break down the bi-implication (<->) into two parts.\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (->):\n   - Introduce the assumption (P1 -> Q1) and the proposition P2.\n   - Use the given equivalences to transform P2 into P1.\n   - Apply the assumption (P1 -> Q1) to get Q1.\n   - Use the given equivalence to transform Q1 into Q2.\n\n4. Prove the backward direction (<-):\n   - Follow a similar approach as the forward direction, but start with (P2 -> Q2) and P1.\n   - Use the equivalences in the opposite direction.\n\n5. Use classical logic if needed:\n   - The imported 'Classical_Prop' library might be useful if classical reasoning is required.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use the 'Qed' tactic to complete the proof.\n\nNote: This problem likely doesn't require the use of ZArith or Psatz libraries, but they're available if needed for any arithmetic reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. Start over with proper introductions:\n   - Use 'intros P1 Q1 P2 Q2 H_P H_Q' to introduce all variables and hypotheses.\n   - This will bring P1, Q1, P2, Q2 into the context as propositions, H_P as (P1 <-> P2), and H_Q as (Q1 <-> Q2).\n\n2. Split the bi-implication:\n   - Use 'split' to break down the main goal into two implications:\n     (P1 -> Q1) -> (P2 -> Q2)\n     (P2 -> Q2) -> (P1 -> Q1)\n\n3. Focus on the first implication (P1 -> Q1) -> (P2 -> Q2):\n   - Introduce the assumption with 'intros H_P1Q1'.\n   - Introduce P2 with 'intro H_P2'.\n   - Use the equivalence H_P to transform P2 into P1.\n   - Apply H_P1Q1 to get Q1.\n   - Use the equivalence H_Q to transform Q1 into Q2.\n\n4. For the second implication (P2 -> Q2) -> (P1 -> Q1):\n   - Follow a similar approach, but use the equivalences in the opposite direction.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct a valid proof for the theorem.\n",
