    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem 'imply_congr' involves four propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and two implications.\n   - The goal is to prove that (P1 -> Q1) is equivalent to (P2 -> Q2), given that P1 is equivalent to P2 and Q1 is equivalent to Q2.\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the 'intros' tactic to introduce the propositions and hypotheses into the context.\n   - Apply the 'split' tactic to break down the bi-implication (<->) into two parts.\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (->):\n   - Introduce the assumption (P1 -> Q1) and the proposition P2.\n   - Use the given equivalences to transform P2 into P1.\n   - Apply the assumption (P1 -> Q1) to get Q1.\n   - Use the given equivalence to transform Q1 into Q2.\n\n4. Prove the backward direction (<-):\n   - Follow a similar approach as the forward direction, but start with (P2 -> Q2) and P1.\n   - Use the equivalences in the opposite direction.\n\n5. Use classical logic if needed:\n   - The imported 'Classical_Prop' library might be useful if classical reasoning is required.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use the 'Qed' tactic to complete the proof.\n\nNote: This problem likely doesn't require the use of ZArith or Psatz libraries, but they're available if needed for any arithmetic reasoning.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced the propositions and hypotheses into the context and split the bi-implication into two parts. Now we need to prove both directions of the implication.\n\nFor the first goal (P1 -> Q1) -> P2 -> Q2:\n1. We should introduce the assumptions (P1 -> Q1) and P2.\n2. Then, we'll use the equivalence H_P to transform P2 into P1.\n3. After that, we can apply the assumption (P1 -> Q1) to get Q1.\n4. Finally, we'll use the equivalence H_Q to transform Q1 into Q2.\n\nFor the second goal (P2 -> Q2) -> P1 -> Q1:\nWe'll follow a similar approach, but in the opposite direction.\n\nThe acting agent should start by addressing the first goal, introducing the necessary assumptions and then using the equivalences to complete the proof for that direction.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The current proof attempt is incorrect as it misunderstands the structure of the theorem and the context after the initial introductions.\n\nImprovement: We need to start over with the correct introductions and then focus on proving the bi-implication by addressing both directions separately using the given hypotheses.\n```\n\nThe current approach has several issues:\n\n1. Misunderstanding of the theorem structure: After the initial introductions, we still need to introduce P2, Q2, and the hypotheses for (P1 <-> P2) and (Q1 <-> Q2).\n\n2. Incorrect use of hypotheses: The proof attempts to use non-existent hypotheses like H_Q and H_P.\n\n3. Misalignment with the goal: The current goal is not what was expected in the thought process, indicating a disconnect between the planning and execution.\n\nTo improve the proof process:\n\n1. Start over with the correct introductions: We should introduce all variables and hypotheses properly.\n\n2. Split the bi-implication: After introductions, we should split the goal into two implications to prove separately.\n\n3. Use the correct hypotheses: For each direction of the proof, we should use the given equivalences (P1 <-> P2) and (Q1 <-> Q2) to transform propositions as needed.\n\n4. Follow a step-by-step approach: For each direction, we should introduce the assumption, use the equivalences to transform propositions, and then apply the appropriate implications to reach the conclusion.\n\n5. Ensure alignment between thought and action: The acting agent should closely follow the reasoning provided, translating each step into the appropriate Coq tactic.\n\nIn the next round, the planning and reasoning should focus on starting the proof from the beginning with the correct introductions, and then tackling one direction of the bi-implication at a time.",
