Analyze the definitions:\n   - mono: A function is monotonic if f(n) <= f(m) whenever n <= m.\n   - func_plus: The sum of two functions, defined as (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x).\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"intros\" to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n   b. Unfold the definitions of mono and func_plus.\n   c. Use a universal quantifier for arbitrary inputs n and m.\n   d. Assume n <= m as the antecedent of the monotonicity property.\n\n4. Main proof strategy:\n   a. Apply the monotonicity property to both f and g separately.\n   b. Combine the results using the properties of inequality and addition.\n\n5. Key steps in the proof:\n   a. Use the monotonicity of f to show f(n) <= f(m).\n   b. Use the monotonicity of g to show g(n) <= g(m).\n   c. Add these inequalities to show f(n) + g(n) <= f(m) + g(m).\n   d.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the lemma mono_func_plus, we should start by following the planned proof structure. The first steps should focus on setting up the proof environment and introducing the necessary hypotheses and variables.\n\nReasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should begin by introducing the functions f and g, as well as the hypotheses that they are monotonic. This will bring these elements into our context for use in the proof.\n\n2. Next, we need to unfold the definition of mono for the func_plus (f + g). This will allow us to work with the concrete definition of monotonicity for the sum function.\n\n3. After unfolding, we'll need to introduce arbitrary integers n and m, along with the assumption that n <= m. This sets up the scenario for proving monotonicity.\n\n4. With these elements in place, we can then focus on proving that (f + g)(n) <= (f + g)(m), which is the core of demonstrating monotonicity for the sum function.\n\n5. To prove this, we'll need to apply the monotonicity properties of f and g separately, and then combine these results.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I recommend that the acting agent start with introducing the functions and hypotheses, then unfold the definition of mono for func_plus. This will set the stage for the core of the proof.\n",
