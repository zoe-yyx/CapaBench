Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with \"intros\" to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n   b. Unfold the definitions of mono and func_plus.\n   c. Use a universal quantifier for arbitrary inputs n and m.\n   d. Assume n <= m as the antecedent of the monotonicity property.\n\n4. Main proof strategy:\n   a. Apply the monotonicity property to both f and g separately.\n   b. Combine the results using the properties of inequality and addition.\n\n5. Key steps in the proof:\n   a. Use the monotonicity of f to show f(n) <= f(m).\n   b. Use the monotonicity of g to show g(n) <= g(m).\n   c. Add these inequalities to show f(n) + g(n) <= f(m) + g(m).\n   d.

    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mono_func_plus, we need to start by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses into our context. Then, we'll unfold the definitions to expose the actual properties we're working with. After that, we can apply the monotonicity properties of f and g to establish the required inequalities. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Introduce variables and hypotheses:\n   Use \"intros f g Hf Hg\" to bring the functions and their monotonicity properties into context.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions:\n   Use \"unfold mono, func_plus\" to expose the actual definitions we're working with.\n\n3. Introduce additional variables for the monotonicity property:\n   Use \"intros n m H\" to bring in the variables for which we need to prove the inequality.\n\n4. State the goal explicitly:\n   At this point, our goal should be to prove: f n + g n <= f m + g m, given n <= m.\n\n5. Apply monotonicity of f:\n   Use \"assert (H1: f n <= f m)\" and prove it using \"apply Hf\" and our hypothesis H.\n\n6. Apply monotonicity of g:\n   Similarly, use \"assert (H2: g n <= g m)\" and prove it using \"apply Hg\" and H.\n\n7. Combine inequalities:\n   Use \"lia\" or a similar tactic to combine these inequalities and prove the final goal.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to construct a valid proof for the theorem.\n",
