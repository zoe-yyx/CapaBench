Apply the monotonicity property to both f and g separately.\n   b. Combine the results using the properties of inequality and addition.\n\n5. Key steps in the proof:\n   a. Use the monotonicity of f to show f(n) <= f(m).\n   b. Use the monotonicity of g to show g(n) <= g(m).\n   c. Add these inequalities to show f(n) + g(n) <= f(m) + g(m).\n   d.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof, we have successfully introduced the functions f and g, their monotonicity hypotheses Hf and Hg, and the variables n and m with the assumption H that n <= m. The goal now is to prove that f n + g n <= f m + g m.\n\nTo proceed, we should use the monotonicity properties of f and g separately and then combine them. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Apply the monotonicity property of f:\n   - We know that f is monotonic (Hf: mono f), and we have n <= m (H).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that f n <= f m.\n\n2. Apply the monotonicity property of g:\n   - Similarly, g is monotonic (Hg: mono g), and we have n <= m (H).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that g n <= g m.\n\n3. Combine these inequalities:\n   - We now have f n <= f m and g n <= g m.\n   - We need to show that their sum also maintains the inequality.\n\n4. Use arithmetic properties:\n   - The sum of two inequalities maintains the inequality.\n   - Therefore, (f n + g n) <= (f m + g m).\n\nTo implement this reasoning, we should guide the acting agent to:\n1. Apply the monotonicity property of f using Hf.\n2. Apply the monotonicity property of g using Hg.\n3. Use these results to prove the final inequality.\n\nThe lia tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) should be helpful in combining these inequalities and completing the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it tried to use variables and hypotheses that were not yet introduced in the current context.\n\nImprovement: Start the proof by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses using intros, then unfold the definitions of mono and func_plus before attempting to prove the inequality.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the current approach was premature in trying to use specific variables and hypotheses that were not yet available in the proof context. This led to errors when trying to assert inequalities for f and g, as these functions were not yet introduced.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Begin the proof by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses:\n   - Use \"intros f g Hf Hg n m H\" to bring all required elements into the context.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions of mono and func_plus:\n   - This will expose the actual properties and functions we're working with.\n\n3. State the goal explicitly:\n   - After unfolding, we should see that we need to prove f n + g n <= f m + g m.\n\n4. Then proceed with the original plan of applying the monotonicity properties of f and g:\n   - Use the hypotheses Hf and Hg to establish f n <= f m and g n <= g m.\n\n5. Finally, use lia or another appropriate tactic to combine these inequalities and complete the proof.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all necessary components are in place before attempting to use them, which should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.",
