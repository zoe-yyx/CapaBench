Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem logic_ex4 involves two predicates P and Q over a type A.\n   - We need to prove that if (∀a, ¬Q(a) -> ¬P(a)), then (∀a, P(a) -> Q(a)).\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros A P Q H a HP\".\n   - This introduces the type A, predicates P and Q, the hypothesis H (∀a, ¬Q(a) -> ¬P(a)), an arbitrary element 'a' of type A, and the assumption HP (P(a)).\n\n3. Use classical logic:\n   - Since the problem involves negation and the Classical_Prop library is imported, we can use the law of excluded middle.\n   - Apply \"destruct (classic (Q a)) as [HQa | HnQa]\".\n\n4. Handle the two cases:\n   Case 1: Q(a) is true\n   - If Q(a) is true, we've directly proved our goal.\n   - Use \"assumption\" or \"exact HQa\".\n\n   Case 2: Q(a) is false\n   - If Q(a) is false, we have a contradiction with our assumptions.\n   - Apply the hypothesis H to our ¬Q(a) to get ¬P(a).\n   - This contradicts our assumption HP (P(a)).\n   - Use \"specialize (H a HnQa)\" to get ¬P(a).\n   - Then use \"contradiction\" to finish the proof.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - The proof should be complete after handling both cases.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- The proof doesn't require direct use of ZArith or Psatz, but these libraries might be useful for more complex problems involving integers.\n- The Setoid library isn't directly used in this proof, but it's good to have for potential equality reasoning in more complex scenarios.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the problem statement and the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the proof structure. The first step is to introduce all the necessary variables and hypotheses into our context. This will allow us to work with these elements in our proof.\n\nWe should begin with the following introduction:\n\n1. Introduce the type A, predicates P and Q, and the hypothesis H (which states that for all a, if Q(a) is false, then P(a) is also false).\n2. Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A.\n3. Introduce the assumption that P(a) is true.\n\nAfter this introduction, we'll have all the necessary components to start our proof. The next logical step would be to apply classical logic, specifically the law of excluded middle, to consider both possibilities for Q(a) - either it's true or false.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start with an introduction step, followed by applying the law of excluded middle to Q(a). This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof, allowing us to handle both cases separately.\n",
