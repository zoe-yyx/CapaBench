Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving the left injection property of the Node constructor in a binary tree structure.\n   - We need to show that if two Node constructions are equal, their left subtrees are also equal.\n\n2. Understand the tree structure:\n   - The tree is defined inductively with two constructors: Leaf and Node.\n   - Node takes three arguments: left subtree, value, and right subtree.\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   - Use inversion on the equality hypothesis to break it down.\n   - This should give us equalities for each component of the Node constructor.\n   - Focus on the equality of the left subtrees.\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the variables and hypothesis.\n   b. Apply inversion to the equality hypothesis.\n   c. Extract the equality of left subtrees from the inversion result.\n   d. Conclude the proof by applying the extracted equality.\n\n5. Consider potential challenges:\n   - The proof might be straightforward and not require additional lemmas.\n   - However, be prepared to use tactics like injection or discriminate if needed.\n\n6. Reflect on the proof:\n   - This proof will establish a fundamental property of the tree structure.\n   - It can be useful for more complex proofs involving tree manipulations.\n\n7. Extension thoughts:\n   - Similar proofs might be needed for the right subtree and the value.\n   - Consider generalizing this proof strategy for other inductive data types with multiple arguments.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof for the Node_inj_left lemma should follow these logical steps:\n\n1. We need to start by introducing the variables and the hypothesis. The variables are l1, v1, r1, l2, v2, and r2, which are the components of the two Node constructors. The hypothesis is the equality between these two Node constructions.\n\n2. The key to this proof lies in the inversion of the equality hypothesis. By applying inversion, we can break down the equality of the Node constructors into equalities of their components.\n\n3. After inversion, we should obtain three separate equalities: one for the left subtrees (l1 = l2), one for the values (v1 = v2), and one for the right subtrees (r1 = r2).\n\n4. Since our goal is to prove that l1 = l2, we can directly use the equality obtained from the inversion step.\n\n5. The proof should be straightforward and not require any additional lemmas or complex tactics. The inversion tactic should provide all the necessary information to complete the proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I recommend that the acting agent start by introducing the variables and hypothesis, then immediately apply the inversion tactic to the equality hypothesis. This should set up the proof for a simple conclusion using the resulting equalities.\n",
