Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem logic_ex8 is a statement about logical implication and disjunction for predicates P and Q over types A and B.\n   - We need to prove that if P implies Q for all a and b, then for any a and b, either not P or Q holds.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start with introducing the universal quantifiers and hypothesis.\n   - Use classical reasoning (law of excluded middle) since we're dealing with a disjunction involving negation.\n   - Set up a case analysis based on whether P a b is true or false.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Introduce variables and hypothesis:\n      - Let A and B be arbitrary types.\n      - Let P and Q be arbitrary predicates on A and B.\n      - Introduce the hypothesis H: forall (a: A) (b: B), P a b -> Q a b.\n      - Take arbitrary a: A and b: B.\n\n   b. Apply classical reasoning:\n      - Use the law of excluded middle to assert that either P a b is true or false.\n\n   c. Case analysis:\n      - Case 1: P a b is true\n        * Use the hypothesis H to derive Q a b.\n        * Conclude the right side of the disjunction (Q a b).\n      - Case 2: P a b is false\n        * Directly conclude the left side of the disjunction (~ P a b).\n\n   d.

Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the quantifiers and implications\n   - Correctly applying classical reasoning\n   - Ensuring all cases are covered in the proof\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Check that the proof covers all possible cases.\n   - Ensure that the conclusion matches the theorem statement exactly.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of theorem logic_ex8, we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis. This will set up our proof environment with all the necessary variables and assumptions.\n\n2. After introduction, we'll have:\n   - A and B as types\n   - P and Q as predicates on A and B\n   - A hypothesis H stating that P implies Q for all a and b\n   - Arbitrary variables a of type A and b of type B\n\n3. The goal will then be to prove: ~ P a b \\/ Q a b\n\n4. To prove this disjunction, we need to use classical reasoning, specifically the law of excluded middle, because we're dealing with a disjunction involving a negation.\n\n5. We should apply the law of excluded middle to assert that either P a b is true or it's false. This will give us two cases to consider.\n\n6. For each case:\n   - If P a b is true, we can use our hypothesis H to derive Q a b, which satisfies the right side of our goal disjunction.\n   - If P a b is false, this directly satisfies the left side of our goal disjunction (~ P a b).\n\n7. By considering both cases, we will have proven the disjunction for all possible scenarios, thus completing the proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by introducing the variables and hypothesis, then proceed to apply classical reasoning for the case analysis.\n",
