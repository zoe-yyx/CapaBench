    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for or_assoc1:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves logical disjunction (OR) operations.\n   - We need to prove that P \\/ (Q \\/ R) implies (P \\/ Q) \\/ R.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros P Q R H\" to introduce the propositions and hypothesis.\n   - Our goal will be to prove (P \\/ Q) \\/ R.\n\n3. Case analysis on the hypothesis H (P \\/ (Q \\/ R)):\n   - Use \"destruct H\" to break down the outer disjunction.\n\n4. Handle the first case (P is true):\n   - If P is true, we can immediately prove (P \\/ Q) \\/ R.\n   - Use \"left\" tactic to choose the left side of the outer disjunction.\n   - Then use \"left\" again to prove P \\/ Q.\n\n5. Handle the second case (Q \\/ R is true):\n   - Further destruct this inner disjunction.\n   \n   5a. If Q is true:\n       - Use \"left\" for the outer disjunction.\n       - Then use \"right\" to prove P \\/ Q.\n   \n   5b. If R is true:\n       - Use \"right\" to directly prove (P \\/ Q) \\/ R.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - All cases should be covered, and Coq should accept the proof as complete.\n\n7. Optional optimization:\n   - Consider using tactics like \"tauto\" or \"intuition\" which are good at handling propositional logic.\n   - These tactics might solve the entire theorem in one step, but it's good to understand the manual approach first.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to set up the proof framework. Following the plan, we should:\n\n1. Introduce the propositions P, Q, R, and the hypothesis H.\n2. Our goal will be to prove (P \\/ Q) \\/ R given the hypothesis H: P \\/ (Q \\/ R).\n\nThe most appropriate tactic to achieve this is \"intros\". This tactic will bring our propositions and hypothesis into the context, allowing us to work with them.\n\nAfter introducing these elements, we should proceed with a case analysis on the hypothesis H. This will allow us to handle the two main cases of our proof: when P is true, and when Q \\/ R is true.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start with the \"intros\" tactic, followed by the \"destruct\" tactic on H. This will set up our proof structure and prepare us for the case analysis that forms the core of our proof strategy.\n",
