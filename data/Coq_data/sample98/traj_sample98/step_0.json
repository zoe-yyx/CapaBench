    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem add_succ_r:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: forall n m, add n (S m) = S (add n m)\n   - We need to prove this equality for all natural numbers n and m\n   - The add function is defined recursively on the first argument (n)\n\n2. Choose Proof Method:\n   - Induction on n is the most suitable approach, as add is defined recursively on n\n\n3. Set Up the Proof:\n   - Begin with \"Proof.\" \n   - Introduce variables: \"intros n m.\"\n   - Start induction: \"induction n as [| n' IHn'].\"\n\n4. Base Case (n = O):\n   - Simplify add O (S m) using the definition of add\n   - Simplify add O m using the definition of add\n   - The equality should be straightforward to prove\n\n5. Inductive Step (n = S n'):\n   - Assume the inductive hypothesis (IHn') for n'\n   - Simplify add (S n') (S m) using the definition of add\n   - Simplify add (S n') m using the definition of add\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis to rewrite the simplified expressions\n   - The equality should follow naturally\n\n6. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Use \"Qed.\" to finish the proof\n\n7. Potential Tactics to Use:\n   - simpl: for simplifying expressions\n   - rewrite: for applying the inductive hypothesis\n   - reflexivity: for proving equalities\n   - f_equal: if needed to prove equality of constructors\n\n8. Possible Challenges:\n   - Be careful with the order of simplification and rewriting\n   - Ensure all necessary simplifications are performed before applying the inductive hypothesis\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem add_succ_r, focusing on induction over n and careful manipulation of the add function's definition.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof process for the theorem add_succ_r, our first steps should focus on setting up the proof structure and initiating the induction. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Begin the proof formally by using the \"Proof.\" command. This signals the start of our proof to Coq.\n\n2. Introduce the universal quantifiers. We need to work with arbitrary natural numbers n and m, so we should use \"intros n m\" to bring these variables into our context.\n\n3. Set up induction on n. Since the add function is defined recursively on its first argument (n), induction on n is the most logical approach. We should use \"induction n as [| n' IHn'].\" This sets up two cases:\n   - The base case where n = O\n   - The inductive step where n = S n', with IHn' as our induction hypothesis\n\n4. For the base case (n = O), we should be ready to simplify the expressions add O (S m) and S (add O m). The definition of add will be crucial here.\n\n5. For the inductive step (n = S n'), we'll need to work with the expressions add (S n') (S m) and S (add (S n') m), and utilize the induction hypothesis IHn'.\n\nBy following these steps, we set up a solid foundation for the proof, aligning with our planned strategy. The acting agent should focus on implementing these initial proof steps, particularly the induction setup, as it forms the backbone of our proof structure.\n",
