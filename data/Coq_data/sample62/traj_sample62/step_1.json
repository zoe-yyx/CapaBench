Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication between two universally quantified statements.\n   - We need to prove: (∀x, P x ∧ Q x → R x) → (∀x, P x → Q x → R x)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'intros' to bring the hypothesis and variables into the context.\n   - We'll have X (Type), P, Q, R (X -> Prop), and the hypothesis H: ∀x, P x ∧ Q x → R x.\n\n3. Prove the conclusion:\n   - Use another 'intros' to bring x, and assumptions for P x and Q x into the context.\n   - Our goal will be to prove R x.\n\n4. Connect the hypothesis to the goal:\n   - We need to use the hypothesis H, but it requires a conjunction P x ∧ Q x.\n   - Create this conjunction from the separate assumptions we have for P x and Q x.\n\n5. Apply the hypothesis:\n   - Once we have P x ∧ Q x, we can apply the hypothesis H to prove R x.\n\n6. Finish the proof:\n   - The goal R x should be proved after applying H to the conjunction.\n\nKey strategies:\n- Use intros to break down the theorem into manageable parts.\n- Construct the needed conjunction from separate assumptions.\n- Apply the hypothesis to bridge the gap between given information and the goal.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced all the necessary variables and hypotheses into our context. Now, our goal is to prove R x.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to use our hypothesis H, which states that for any x, if P x and Q x are both true, then R x is true. We already have HP : P x and HQ : Q x in our context, but H expects a conjunction of these two.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to create a conjunction P x /\\ Q x from HP and HQ. Once we have this conjunction, we can apply H to prove R x.\n\nThe 'split' tactic would work here, but it's not necessary since we already have the individual components. Instead, we can directly construct the conjunction and apply H in one step.\n\nThe acting agent should use the 'apply' tactic with H, and then provide the conjunction as an argument. This can be done using the following command:\n\napply H. split; [exact HP | exact HQ].\n\nThis command will:\n1. Apply the hypothesis H\n2. Create the required conjunction P x /\\ Q x\n3. Use HP to prove the left side of the conjunction (P x)\n4. Use HQ to prove the right side of the conjunction (Q x)\n\nAfter this step, the proof should be complete.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it tried to use variables (H, HP, HQ) that were not introduced into the context.\n\nImprovement: We need to start the proof by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses using the 'intros' tactic before attempting to apply them.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that our previous approach was premature. We attempted to use variables and hypotheses that had not yet been introduced into our proof context. This is a common mistake when transitioning from the planning phase to the actual proof construction.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start the proof with the 'Proof.' command.\n2. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring all the necessary variables and hypotheses into our context. This should include X, P, Q, R, and the hypothesis for (forall x : X, P x /\\ Q x -> R x).\n3. Introduce x, and the hypotheses for P x and Q x.\n4. Only then should we proceed with applying the main hypothesis and constructing the conjunction.\n\nHere's a suggested structure for the next action:\n\n1. Begin the proof:\n   Proof.\n\n2. Introduce all variables and the main hypothesis:\n   intros X P Q R H x HP HQ.\n\n3. Now we can apply H and split the conjunction:\n   apply H. split; assumption.\n\nThis approach should set up the proof correctly and allow us to complete it without errors. The acting agent should implement these steps in the next round.",
