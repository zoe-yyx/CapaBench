Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication between two universally quantified statements.\n   - We need to prove: (∀x, P x ∧ Q x → R x) → (∀x, P x → Q x → R x)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'intros' to bring the hypothesis and variables into the context.\n   - We'll have X (Type), P, Q, R (X -> Prop), and the hypothesis H: ∀x, P x ∧ Q x → R x.\n\n3. Prove the conclusion:\n   - Use another 'intros' to bring x, and assumptions for P x and Q x into the context.\n   - Our goal will be to prove R x.\n\n4. Connect the hypothesis to the goal:\n   - We need to use the hypothesis H, but it requires a conjunction P x ∧ Q x.\n   - Create this conjunction from the separate assumptions we have for P x and Q x.\n\n5. Apply the hypothesis:\n   - Once we have P x ∧ Q x, we can apply the hypothesis H to prove R x.\n\n6. Finish the proof:\n   - The goal R x should be proved after applying H to the conjunction.\n\nKey strategies:\n- Use intros to break down the theorem into manageable parts.\n- Construct the needed conjunction from separate assumptions.\n- Apply the hypothesis to bridge the gap between given information and the goal.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof, our first step should be to set up the initial context as outlined in the planning strategy. We need to introduce the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis into our context.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n1. We should begin by using the 'intros' tactic to bring the following into our proof context:\n   - X as the Type\n   - P, Q, and R as predicates of type X -> Prop\n   - The hypothesis that for all x, if P x and Q x then R x\n\nThis step will set the stage for the rest of the proof by giving us the necessary components to work with. It aligns with step 2 of our planning strategy and prepares us for the subsequent steps where we'll need to use these introduced elements.\n\nAfter this introduction, we'll be in a position to focus on proving the conclusion for an arbitrary x, which will be our next major step.\n",
