Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication between two universally quantified statements.\n   - We need to prove: (∀x, P x ∧ Q x → R x) → (∀x, P x → Q x → R x)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'intros' to bring the hypothesis and variables into the context.\n   - We'll have X (Type), P, Q, R (X -> Prop), and the hypothesis H: ∀x, P x ∧ Q x → R x.\n\n3. Prove the conclusion:\n   - Use another 'intros' to bring x, and assumptions for P x and Q x into the context.\n   - Our goal will be to prove R x.\n\n4. Connect the hypothesis to the goal:\n   - We need to use the hypothesis H, but it requires a conjunction P x ∧ Q x.\n   - Create this conjunction from the separate assumptions we have for P x and Q x.\n\n5. Apply the hypothesis:\n   - Once we have P x ∧ Q x, we can apply the hypothesis H to prove R x.\n\n6. Finish the proof:\n   - The goal R x should be proved after applying H to the conjunction.\n\nKey strategies:\n- Use intros to break down the theorem into manageable parts.\n- Construct the needed conjunction from separate assumptions.\n- Apply the hypothesis to bridge the gap between given information and the goal.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, we need to start by properly introducing all the necessary variables and hypotheses into our context. This will set up the proof correctly and allow us to apply our strategy effectively. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should begin the proof formally with the 'Proof.' command. This is a good practice to clearly mark the beginning of our proof.\n\n2. Next, we need to use the 'intros' tactic to bring all the relevant variables and hypotheses into our context. This includes:\n   - X (the Type)\n   - P, Q, R (the propositions of type X -> Prop)\n   - H (our main hypothesis: forall x : X, P x /\\ Q x -> R x)\n   - x (a specific element of X)\n   - HP (hypothesis that P x holds)\n   - HQ (hypothesis that Q x holds)\n\n3. After introducing these elements, we'll be in the right position to apply our main hypothesis H. We can then split the conjunction P x /\\ Q x, which we can prove using the HP and HQ hypotheses we've introduced.\n\n4. The 'assumption' tactic should be sufficient to prove both parts of the split conjunction, as HP and HQ will match exactly what we need.\n\nThis approach aligns with our original plan while addressing the issues highlighted in the reflection. It sets up the proof structure correctly, allowing us to then apply the key steps of our proving strategy.\n",
