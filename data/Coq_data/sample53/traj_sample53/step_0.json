Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to bring all hypotheses into the context\n   - Use a proof by cases (destruct) on the disjunction P \\/ Q\n   - For each case, apply the corresponding hypothesis to prove R\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Start with 'intros P Q R H1 H2 H3' to introduce all variables and hypotheses\n   b. Use 'destruct H3' to split the proof into two cases: P and Q\n   c. For the P case, apply H1 (P -> R) to prove R\n   d. For the Q case, apply H2 (Q -> R) to prove R\n\n4. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are solved\n   - Use 'Qed' to complete the proof\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Be mindful of the naming of hypotheses after destruct\n   - Ensure proper application of hypotheses in each case\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned proof structure. The first step is to introduce all the variables and hypotheses into the context. This will set up our proof environment and allow us to work with the specific instances of P, Q, and R, as well as the given implications.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should use the 'intros' tactic to bring all the quantified variables and hypotheses into the context. This aligns with step 3a of our plan.\n\n2. After introducing the variables and hypotheses, we'll have a clear view of our goal and the available premises to work with.\n\n3. Introducing the hypotheses will prepare us for the next crucial step, which is to destruct the disjunction P \\/ Q.\n\n4. By introducing all elements at once, we maintain a clear and organized proof state, making subsequent steps easier to manage.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with introducing all variables and hypotheses using the 'intros' tactic. This will set the stage for the core of our proof strategy, which involves case analysis on the disjunction P \\/ Q.\n",
