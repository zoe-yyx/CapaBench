    "reasoning": "\nGiven the theorem statement and the planning strategy, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. The theorem proj1 is a fundamental logical property of conjunction, stating that if we have P /\\ Q, we can derive P.\n\n2. To prove this, we need to start by introducing the propositions P and Q, as well as the hypothesis that P /\\ Q is true. This will set up our context for the proof.\n\n3. Once we have the hypothesis P /\\ Q, we can use the property of conjunction that allows us to separate it into its individual components. This will give us direct access to P, which is what we need to prove.\n\n4. After separating the conjunction, we should have P directly available in our context, which is exactly what we need to prove our goal.\n\n5. The proof doesn't require any complex tactics or the use of the imported libraries. It can be completed using basic logical reasoning and simple Coq tactics.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the acting agent should proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Use 'intros' to bring P, Q, and the hypothesis P /\\ Q into the context.\n2. Use 'destruct' to break down the conjunction P /\\ Q into its components.\n3. Use a simple tactic like 'exact' or 'assumption' to complete the proof with the now-available P.\n\nThis approach directly follows the planning strategy and should lead to a concise and clear proof of the theorem.\n",
