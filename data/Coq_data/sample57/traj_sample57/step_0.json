The first step is to introduce the proposition P and split the bi-directional implication into two parts. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start the proof by introducing the proposition P.\n2. Use the 'split' tactic to separate the two directions of the equivalence.\n3. For the left-to-right direction (P /\\ P -> P):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis (P /\\ P).\n   b. Destruct this conjunction to get two separate hypotheses of P.\n   c. The goal P should then be trivially provable.\n4. For the right-to-left direction (P -> P /\\ P):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis P.\n   b. Use 'split' to create two subgoals, both being P.\n   c. Both subgoals should be directly provable from the hypothesis.\n\nThese steps will effectively prove both directions of the equivalence, establishing the theorem. The acting agent should start by introducing P and splitting the bi-directional implication.\n",
