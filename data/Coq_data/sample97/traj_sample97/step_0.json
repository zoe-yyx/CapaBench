Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any natural number n, adding 0 to the right of n is equal to n itself.\n   - We need to prove: forall n, add n O = n\n\n2. Analyze the definitions:\n   - The natural numbers (nat) are defined inductively with O and S.\n   - The addition function (add) is defined recursively on the first argument.\n\n3. Choose the proof method:\n   - Use induction on n, as the add function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n4. Outline the proof structure:\n   a. Start with the induction principle on n.\n   b. Prove the base case: add O O = O\n   c. Prove the inductive step: \n      Assume add n O = n, then prove add (S n) O = S n\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no historical actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned proof structure. The first step is to apply induction on n, as this theorem is about a property that holds for all natural numbers and the add function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should begin the proof by applying induction on n. This will set up our proof structure with two main parts: the base case and the inductive step.\n\n2. By applying induction, we'll generate two subgoals:\n   - Base case: We need to prove that add O O = O\n   - Inductive step: We need to prove that for any n, if add n O = n, then add (S n) O = S n\n\n3. This induction strategy aligns with the recursive definition of the add function and will allow us to prove the theorem for all natural numbers.\n\n4. After applying induction, we should focus on proving the base case first, as it's typically simpler and sets the foundation for the inductive step.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start the proof by applying induction on n.\n",
