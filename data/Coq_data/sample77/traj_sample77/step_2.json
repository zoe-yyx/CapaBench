Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a logical implication involving universal quantifiers and two predicates P and Q.\n   - We need to prove that if (∀a b, ~P a b ∨ Q a b) then (∀a b, P a b → Q a b).\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use universal introduction to introduce arbitrary a: A and b: B.\n   - Assume P a b as a hypothesis.\n   - Our goal will be to prove Q a b.\n\n3. Leverage the given premise:\n   - Apply the premise (∀a b, ~P a b ∨ Q a b) to our arbitrary a and b.\n   - This will give us a disjunction: ~P a b ∨ Q a b.\n\n4. Use case analysis:\n   - Perform a case analysis on the disjunction ~P a b ∨ Q a b.\n   - Case 1: ~P a b\n     - This contradicts our assumption P a b.\n     - Use contradiction to prove Q a b in this case.\n   - Case 2: Q a b\n     - This directly proves our goal.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - Both cases lead to Q a b, which is our goal.\n   - This completes the proof of the implication P a b → Q a b for arbitrary a and b.\n\n6. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce universal quantifiers and hypothesis\n   - apply: to use the premise\n   - destruct: for case analysis on the disjunction\n   - contradiction: to handle the contradictory case\n   - assumption: for the direct case\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the current state of the proof and the reflection on the previous attempt, we should focus on correctly handling both cases of the disjunction while fixing the syntax error in the contradiction tactic. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have already introduced the necessary variables and hypotheses, and specialized H for a and b.\n2. We've also correctly destructed H into two cases: HnotP and HQ.\n3. For the first case (HnotP), we need to use the contradiction tactic without arguments. This will automatically find the contradiction between HnotP (~ P a b) and HP (P a b).\n4. For the second case (HQ), we can directly use HQ to prove our goal Q a b.\n5. We should use proper bullet points to structure our proof and handle both cases.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should:\n1. Use 'contradiction' without arguments for the first case.\n2. Use 'exact HQ' for the second case.\n3. Ensure proper bullet usage for both cases.\n\nThis approach will address the syntax error, properly handle both cases of the disjunction, and complete the proof.\n",
