    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a logical implication involving universal quantifiers and two predicates P and Q.\n   - We need to prove that if (∀a b, ~P a b ∨ Q a b) then (∀a b, P a b → Q a b).\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use universal introduction to introduce arbitrary a: A and b: B.\n   - Assume P a b as a hypothesis.\n   - Our goal will be to prove Q a b.\n\n3. Leverage the given premise:\n   - Apply the premise (∀a b, ~P a b ∨ Q a b) to our arbitrary a and b.\n   - This will give us a disjunction: ~P a b ∨ Q a b.\n\n4. Use case analysis:\n   - Perform a case analysis on the disjunction ~P a b ∨ Q a b.\n   - Case 1: ~P a b\n     - This contradicts our assumption P a b.\n     - Use contradiction to prove Q a b in this case.\n   - Case 2: Q a b\n     - This directly proves our goal.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - Both cases lead to Q a b, which is our goal.\n   - This completes the proof of the implication P a b → Q a b for arbitrary a and b.\n\n6. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce universal quantifiers and hypothesis\n   - apply: to use the premise\n   - destruct: for case analysis on the disjunction\n   - contradiction: to handle the contradictory case\n   - assumption: for the direct case\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to properly apply the hypothesis H to our specific a and b. We can do this using the 'specialize' tactic.\n\n2. After applying H, we'll have a disjunction (~P a b \\/ Q a b) that we need to analyze. We can use the 'destruct' tactic to split this into two cases.\n\n3. In the first case, we'll have ~P a b, which contradicts our hypothesis HP (P a b). We can use this contradiction to prove our goal.\n\n4. In the second case, we'll directly have Q a b, which is exactly our goal.\n\n5. By handling both these cases, we'll complete the proof.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should be:\n\n- Use 'specialize (H a b)' to apply H to our specific a and b.\n- Use 'destruct H as [HnotP | HQ]' to split into the two cases.\n- For the first case, use 'contradiction' to handle the contradictory situation.\n- For the second case, use 'exact HQ' to directly prove the goal.\n\nThese steps will effectively leverage the given hypothesis and complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof steps were correct, but there was a syntax error in the contradiction tactic and an incorrect bullet usage.\n\nImprovement: Use 'contradiction' without arguments, and ensure proper bullet usage for each case in the proof.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights two main issues in the current proof attempt:\n\n1. Syntax error in the contradiction tactic: \n   The tactic 'contradiction HnotP HP' was used, but 'contradiction' doesn't require arguments. It automatically finds the contradiction in the context.\n\n2. Incorrect bullet usage:\n   The proof uses bullets (-) for both cases, but the second case was not properly handled due to the error in the first case.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Use 'contradiction' without arguments in the first case.\n2. Ensure proper bullet usage for both cases.\n3. Complete the proof by handling both cases correctly.\n\nThe improved proof steps should look like this:\n\n- intros A B P Q H a b HP.\n- specialize (H a b).\n- destruct H as [HnotP | HQ].\n  + contradiction.\n  + exact HQ.\n\nThis structure ensures that both cases are properly addressed, and the contradiction is handled correctly in the first case. The second case remains the same, as it was already correct.\n\nFor future actions, it's important to:\n1. Pay attention to the syntax of tactics, especially those that work automatically like 'contradiction'.\n2. Ensure proper use of bullets or other proof structuring elements when dealing with multiple subgoals.\n3. Always check the error messages carefully, as they often provide valuable information about what went wrong and where.",
