Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a logical implication involving universal quantifiers and two predicates P and Q.\n   - We need to prove that if (∀a b, ~P a b ∨ Q a b) then (∀a b, P a b → Q a b).\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use universal introduction to introduce arbitrary a: A and b: B.\n   - Assume P a b as a hypothesis.\n   - Our goal will be to prove Q a b.\n\n3. Leverage the given premise:\n   - Apply the premise (∀a b, ~P a b ∨ Q a b) to our arbitrary a and b.\n   - This will give us a disjunction: ~P a b ∨ Q a b.\n\n4. Use case analysis:\n   - Perform a case analysis on the disjunction ~P a b ∨ Q a b.\n   - Case 1: ~P a b\n     - This contradicts our assumption P a b.\n     - Use contradiction to prove Q a b in this case.\n   - Case 2: Q a b\n     - This directly proves our goal.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - Both cases lead to Q a b, which is our goal.\n   - This completes the proof of the implication P a b → Q a b for arbitrary a and b.\n\n6. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce universal quantifiers and hypothesis\n   - apply: to use the premise\n   - destruct: for case analysis on the disjunction\n   - contradiction: to handle the contradictory case\n   - assumption: for the direct case\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and there are no historical actions or current observations, we should start by following the first steps of our planned approach:\n\n1. Introduce the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis:\n   We need to introduce A and B as types, P and Q as predicates, and the premise (forall (a: A) (b: B), ~ P a b \\/ Q a b).\n\n2. Set up the goal structure:\n   After introducing these elements, we should also introduce arbitrary a: A and b: B, and assume P a b as a hypothesis. This will set up our goal to prove Q a b under these conditions.\n\n3. Apply the premise:\n   We should then apply the premise to our arbitrary a and b to obtain the disjunction ~P a b \\/ Q a b.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof structure and prepare us for the case analysis that will follow. The acting agent should use the 'intros' tactic to introduce the necessary elements and hypotheses, and then use the 'apply' tactic to utilize the premise.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt incorrectly tried to apply the hypothesis H directly to a and b, which are variables of type A and B respectively, not arguments to the function.\n\nImprovement: We should apply the hypothesis H to the specific a and b we have, then use 'destruct' on the resulting disjunction to handle both cases of ~P a b and Q a b separately.\n```\n\nBased on the current observation, there were several errors in the proof attempt:\n\n1. The application of H to a and b was incorrect. H is a function that takes a and b as arguments, not a lemma to be applied to them.\n\n2. The attempt to destruct 'a' was incorrect because 'a' is not an inductive type or a proposition, it's a variable of type A.\n\n3. The use of bullets (-) and the attempt to use 'contradiction' and 'exact HQ' were premature, as we hadn't properly set up the cases yet.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Correctly apply H to our specific a and b.\n2. Use 'destruct' on the resulting disjunction.\n3. Handle both cases properly, using the contradiction between ~P a b and HP in the first case, and directly using Q a b in the second case.\n\nThe acting agent should start with:\n\n```coq\nspecialize (H a b).\ndestruct H as [HnotP | HQ].\n```\n\nThis will properly set up the two cases we need to handle. After this, we can proceed with the case analysis, handling the contradiction in the first case and using HQ directly in the second case.",
