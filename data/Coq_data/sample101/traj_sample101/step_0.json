Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any natural numbers n, m, and p, add p n = add p m if and only if n = m.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros n m p\" to introduce the variables.\n   - Use \"split\" to separate the two directions of the iff statement.\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (->):\n   - Assume \"add p n = add p m\".\n   - Use induction on p:\n     a. Base case (p = O): \n        - Simplify add O n and add O m to n and m respectively.\n        - The hypothesis becomes n = m, which is exactly what we want to prove.\n     b. Inductive case (p = S p'):\n        - Use the induction hypothesis.\n        - Simplify add (S p') n and add (S p') m.\n        - Show that if S (add p' n) = S (add p' m), then add p' n = add p' m.\n        - Apply the induction hypothesis to conclude n = m.\n\n4. Prove the reverse direction (<-):\n   - Assume \"n = m\".\n   - Use \"rewrite\" to replace m with n in the goal.\n   - The goal becomes \"add p n = add p n\", which is true by reflexivity.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - Both directions are proved, so the iff statement is established.\n   - Use \"Qed\" to complete the proof.\n\n6. Additional considerations:\n   - We may need to use lemmas about the properties of addition, such as associativity or commutativity.\n   - If such lemmas are not provided, we might need to prove them separately.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin our proof of the theorem add_cancel_l, we should follow the planning strategy outlined. Let's start by setting up the proof structure:\n\n1. We need to introduce the variables n, m, and p into our context.\n2. Since this is an if and only if (iff) statement, we should split the proof into two directions.\n3. For the forward direction (->), we'll need to use induction on p, as the addition function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n4. For the reverse direction (<-), we can use a simpler approach with rewriting.\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, our first steps should be:\n\n1. Introduce the variables using \"intros n m p\".\n2. Split the iff statement using \"split\".\n3. Start with the forward direction, which will require induction on p.\n\nThe acting agent should begin with these steps to set up the proof structure. After this, we'll be ready to tackle the more complex part of the proof, which is the induction on p for the forward direction.\n",
