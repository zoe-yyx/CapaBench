    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that for any two integers x and y, the sum of their squares is greater than or equal to their product.\n   - This is a well-known inequality, often referred to as the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality for two numbers.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros x y\" to introduce the variables.\n   - The goal will be to prove: x * x + y * y >= x * y\n\n3. Algebraic manipulation:\n   - Rewrite the inequality in a form that's easier to prove:\n     x * x + y * y - x * y >= 0\n   - This can be factored as: (x - y)^2 / 2 >= 0\n\n4. Proof strategy:\n   - Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative.\n   - (x - y)^2 is always non-negative for any integers x and y.\n\n5. Proof steps:\n   a. Rewrite the goal to (x - y)^2 / 2 >= 0\n   b. Apply the property that squares are non-negative\n   c. Use arithmetic properties to show that if (x - y)^2 >= 0, then (x - y)^2 / 2 >= 0\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - replace: to rewrite the goal\n   - assert: to introduce the intermediate step about squares being non-negative\n   - nia: for non-linear integer arithmetic, which might solve the goal automatically\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the relationship between algebraic manipulation and geometric intuition.\n   - It showcases how rewriting an inequality can simplify the proof process.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by following the initial steps of our plan. Here's the reasoning for the next actions:\n\n1. Begin by introducing the variables x and y into the context. This will allow us to work with these variables in our proof.\n\n2. After introducing the variables, we should consider rewriting the goal into a more manageable form. As per our plan, we want to show that (x - y)^2 / 2 >= 0, which is equivalent to our original goal.\n\n3. However, before we do this complex rewrite, it might be beneficial to first try the 'nia' tactic. The 'nia' tactic is powerful for non-linear integer arithmetic and might be able to solve our goal automatically or at least simplify it significantly.\n\n4. If 'nia' doesn't solve the goal completely, we should then proceed with our planned algebraic manipulation. We can use the 'replace' tactic to rewrite the goal into (x - y)^2 / 2 >= 0.\n\n5. After this rewrite, we can assert that (x - y)^2 >= 0, which is true for all integers x and y. This assertion will help us prove our final goal.\n\n6. Finally, we can use arithmetic properties to show that if (x - y)^2 >= 0, then (x - y)^2 / 2 >= 0, which should complete our proof.\n\nThis reasoning provides a step-by-step approach to proving the theorem, starting with the basics and progressively working towards the final goal. It combines direct tactics like 'intros' with more advanced ones like 'nia', and includes algebraic manipulation to simplify the proof.\n",
