    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem shift_up1_eq, we should follow the planned structure:\n\n1. First, we need to introduce the function f that the theorem is quantified over. This sets up the context for our proof.\n\n2. Next, we should apply functional extensionality. This is a crucial step because we're proving equality between two functions. Functional extensionality allows us to prove this equality by showing that the functions produce the same output for all inputs.\n\n3. After applying extensionality, we'll need to introduce a variable (let's call it x) that represents an arbitrary input to these functions.\n\n4. With the function f and input x in our context, we can then unfold the definitions of shift_up1 and func_plus. This will expose the actual computations being performed by these functions.\n\n5. Once the definitions are unfolded, we may need to simplify the expressions. However, in this case, the expressions might already be in their simplest form after unfolding.\n\n6. Finally, we should be able to prove the equality of the resulting expressions, likely using reflexivity since they should be identical after unfolding.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I recommend that the acting agent start with the following steps:\n1. Use the \"intros f\" tactic to introduce the function f.\n2. Apply functional extensionality with \"extensionality x\".\n3. Use the \"unfold\" tactic to expand the definitions of shift_up1 and func_plus.\n\nAfter these steps, we can reassess the goal state and determine if further simplification or direct proof of equality is needed.\n",
