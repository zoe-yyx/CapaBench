    "planning_context": "\nTo prove the theorem \"not_forall\", we will follow this strategic plan:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if it's not true that P holds for all x in X, then there exists an x in X for which P does not hold.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the universal quantifier.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros X P H\" to introduce the type X, predicate P, and the hypothesis H.\n   - H will be of the form \"~ (forall x: X, P x)\".\n\n3. Use classical logic:\n   - Since this theorem involves negation and existential quantification, we may need to use classical logic.\n   - Prepare to use the law of excluded middle if necessary.\n\n4. Consider proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume the negation of our goal and aim for a contradiction.\n   - This means assuming \"~ (exists x: X, ~ P x)\" and trying to derive a contradiction with H.\n\n5. Utilize the \"not_exists\" theorem:\n   - Apply the \"not_exists\" theorem to our assumption.\n   - This will give us \"forall x: X, ~ ~ P x\".\n\n6. Use double negation elimination:\n   - In classical logic, we can eliminate double negations.\n   - Transform \"forall x: X, ~ ~ P x\" to \"forall x: X, P x\".\n\n7. Derive the contradiction:\n   - We now have \"forall x: X, P x\", which directly contradicts our initial hypothesis H.\n\n8. Conclude the proof:\n   - Having reached a contradiction, we can conclude that our initial assumption was false.\n   - Therefore, the original statement \"(exists x: X, ~ P x)\" must be true.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are discharged and the proof is complete.\n\nThis plan leverages the provided \"not_exists\" theorem and classical logic to prove the contrapositive of the universal quantifier, which is essentially what the \"not_forall\" theorem represents.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem \"not_forall\", we need to restructure our approach:\n\n1. Start by introducing the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis:\n   - Use \"intros X P H\" to bring X, P, and the hypothesis into context.\n\n2. Apply the principle of excluded middle:\n   - Use \"apply NNPP\" to set up a proof by contradiction.\n\n3. Introduce the negation of our goal as a new hypothesis:\n   - Use \"intros H_contra\" to assume the negation of the existential statement.\n\n4. Apply the not_exists theorem to H_contra:\n   - This will give us \"forall x : X, ~ ~ P x\".\n\n5. Use this to derive \"forall x : X, P x\":\n   - Apply double negation elimination to each x.\n\n6. This directly contradicts our initial hypothesis H:\n   - Apply H to the derived statement to reach a contradiction.\n\n7. The contradiction completes the proof:\n   - The proof by contradiction will be automatically completed by NNPP.\n\nThis approach follows classical logic principles and leverages the provided not_exists theorem to prove the contrapositive of the universal quantifier, which is the essence of the not_forall theorem.\n",
