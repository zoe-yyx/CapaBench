    "planning_context": "\nTo prove the theorem \"not_forall\", we will follow this strategic plan:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if it's not true that P holds for all x in X, then there exists an x in X for which P does not hold.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the universal quantifier.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros X P H\" to introduce the type X, predicate P, and the hypothesis H.\n   - H will be of the form \"~ (forall x: X, P x)\".\n\n3. Use classical logic:\n   - Since this theorem involves negation and existential quantification, we may need to use classical logic.\n   - Prepare to use the law of excluded middle if necessary.\n\n4. Consider proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume the negation of our goal and aim for a contradiction.\n   - This means assuming \"~ (exists x: X, ~ P x)\" and trying to derive a contradiction with H.\n\n5. Utilize the \"not_exists\" theorem:\n   - Apply the \"not_exists\" theorem to our assumption.\n   - This will give us \"forall x: X, ~ ~ P x\".\n\n6. Use double negation elimination:\n   - In classical logic, we can eliminate double negations.\n   - Transform \"forall x: X, ~ ~ P x\" to \"forall x: X, P x\".\n\n7. Derive the contradiction:\n   - We now have \"forall x: X, P x\", which directly contradicts our initial hypothesis H.\n\n8. Conclude the proof:\n   - Having reached a contradiction, we can conclude that our initial assumption was false.\n   - Therefore, the original statement \"(exists x: X, ~ P x)\" must be true.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are discharged and the proof is complete.\n\nThis plan leverages the provided \"not_exists\" theorem and classical logic to prove the contrapositive of the universal quantifier, which is essentially what the \"not_forall\" theorem represents.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our current state in the proof and the planning strategy, we've made good progress. We've introduced our variables and hypothesis, applied the principle of double negation elimination (NNPP), and set up a proof by contradiction. Now, we need to derive the contradiction to complete our proof. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have the hypothesis H_contra: ~ (exists x : X, ~ P x)\n   This is exactly the form we need to apply the not_exists theorem we were given.\n\n2. Applying not_exists to H_contra will give us: forall x : X, ~ ~ P x\n   This is equivalent to saying that P holds for all x in X, which contradicts our original hypothesis H.\n\n3. After applying not_exists, we'll need to use double negation elimination to simplify ~ ~ P x to P x.\n\n4. Once we have forall x : X, P x, this directly contradicts our hypothesis H: ~ (forall x : X, P x)\n\n5. With this contradiction, we can conclude False, which completes our proof by contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should be:\n1. Apply the not_exists theorem to H_contra\n2. Use double negation elimination\n3. Show that the result contradicts H\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to incorrect variable introductions and usage of non-existent hypotheses.\n\nImprovement: We need to start the proof by properly introducing the universal quantifiers and hypothesis, then apply the principle of excluded middle before proceeding with the proof by contradiction.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt encountered several issues:\n\n1. We tried to use variables and hypotheses (X, H_contra, H, H_all) that were not properly introduced in the context.\n\n2. The structure of the proof was not set up correctly. We should have started by introducing the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis for the negation of the universal statement.\n\n3. We attempted to use NNPP (double negation elimination) too early in the proof, before setting up the contradiction properly.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Start the proof by introducing the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis:\n   `intros X P H.`\n\n2. Apply the principle of excluded middle to set up a proof by cases:\n   `apply NNPP.`\n\n3. Introduce the negation of our goal as a hypothesis for contradiction:\n   `intros H_contra.`\n\n4. Then proceed with the proof by contradiction, using the not_exists theorem and deriving the contradiction as planned in the previous thought process.\n\nBy following these steps, we'll have a more structured and correct approach to proving the theorem. In the next iteration, we should focus on implementing these improvements and carefully following the logical steps to reach the contradiction.",
