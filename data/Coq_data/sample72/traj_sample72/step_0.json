    "planning_context": "\nTo prove the theorem \"not_forall\", we will follow this strategic plan:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if it's not true that P holds for all x in X, then there exists an x in X for which P does not hold.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the universal quantifier.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros X P H\" to introduce the type X, predicate P, and the hypothesis H.\n   - H will be of the form \"~ (forall x: X, P x)\".\n\n3. Use classical logic:\n   - Since this theorem involves negation and existential quantification, we may need to use classical logic.\n   - Prepare to use the law of excluded middle if necessary.\n\n4. Consider proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume the negation of our goal and aim for a contradiction.\n   - This means assuming \"~ (exists x: X, ~ P x)\" and trying to derive a contradiction with H.\n\n5. Utilize the \"not_exists\" theorem:\n   - Apply the \"not_exists\" theorem to our assumption.\n   - This will give us \"forall x: X, ~ ~ P x\".\n\n6. Use double negation elimination:\n   - In classical logic, we can eliminate double negations.\n   - Transform \"forall x: X, ~ ~ P x\" to \"forall x: X, P x\".\n\n7. Derive the contradiction:\n   - We now have \"forall x: X, P x\", which directly contradicts our initial hypothesis H.\n\n8. Conclude the proof:\n   - Having reached a contradiction, we can conclude that our initial assumption was false.\n   - Therefore, the original statement \"(exists x: X, ~ P x)\" must be true.\n\n9. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are discharged and the proof is complete.\n\nThis plan leverages the provided \"not_exists\" theorem and classical logic to prove the contrapositive of the universal quantifier, which is essentially what the \"not_forall\" theorem represents.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem \"not_forall\", we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing the variables and hypothesis:\n   - We need to introduce X (the type), P (the predicate), and the hypothesis that it's not true for all x in X that P(x) holds.\n   - This sets up our initial proof state and gives us something to work with.\n\n2. Set up for a proof by contradiction:\n   - Since we're dealing with a negation of a universal quantifier, a proof by contradiction is a good approach.\n   - We should assume the opposite of what we want to prove and aim for a contradiction.\n\n3. Use the \"not_exists\" theorem:\n   - We have this theorem available, and it's closely related to what we're trying to prove.\n   - Applying this theorem to our contradiction assumption will give us a universal quantifier, which we can then use to derive a contradiction with our initial hypothesis.\n\n4. Prepare for classical reasoning:\n   - Since we're dealing with negations and existential quantifiers, we may need to use classical logic principles.\n   - Be ready to use double negation elimination or the law of excluded middle if necessary.\n\nGiven these considerations, I suggest the acting agent start with the following steps:\n\n1. Begin the proof with \"Proof.\"\n2. Use \"intros X P H\" to introduce the variables and hypothesis.\n3. Apply the contradiction approach by using \"apply NNPP\" (principle of double negation elimination from classical logic).\n4. Introduce the contradiction assumption with \"intros H_contra\".\n\nThis will set up the proof structure and allow us to proceed with applying the \"not_exists\" theorem in the next steps.\n",
