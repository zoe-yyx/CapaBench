    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem iter_S:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem involves Nat.iter, which is a function that applies a given function 'f' to an initial value 'x' 'n' times.\n   - We need to prove that applying 'f' once to 'x' and then iterating 'n' times is equivalent to iterating 'S n' (n+1) times on 'x'.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use induction on 'n' as the primary proof strategy.\n   - The base case will be when n = 0.\n   - The inductive step will involve proving for n+1 given it holds for n.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Start with induction on 'n'.\n   b. Base case (n = 0):\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of Nat.iter.\n      - Show that they are equivalent.\n   c. Inductive step:\n      - Assume the theorem holds for n (induction hypothesis).\n      - Prove it holds for S n.\n      - Use the definition of Nat.iter and the induction hypothesis.\n\n4. Key tactics to use:\n   - induction n: To start the induction on n.\n   - simpl: To simplify Nat.iter expressions.\n   - rewrite: To apply the induction hypothesis.\n   - reflexivity: To prove equality when both sides are identical.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the behavior of Nat.iter for different values of n.\n   - Correctly applying the induction hypothesis in the inductive step.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof is logically sound.\n   - Check that all cases (base and inductive) are covered.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem iter_S, focusing on induction as the main proof strategy and outlining the key steps and tactics to be used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the inductive step of the proof:\n\n1. We have successfully simplified both sides of the equation using 'simpl.', which was correct.\n\n2. The key insight is that we need to focus on the right side of the equation after simplification. The right side contains 'Nat.iter (S n') f x', which matches the form of our induction hypothesis.\n\n3. We should use the induction hypothesis to rewrite the right side of the equation. The correct tactic is 'rewrite <- IHn'.' (note the direction of the arrow).\n\n4. After this rewrite, both sides of the equation should be identical, allowing us to complete the proof with 'reflexivity'.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of tactics for the inductive step should be:\n- simpl.\n- rewrite <- IHn'.\n- reflexivity.\n\nThis approach aligns with the structure of Nat.iter and correctly applies the induction hypothesis, which should resolve the previous error and complete the proof.\n",
