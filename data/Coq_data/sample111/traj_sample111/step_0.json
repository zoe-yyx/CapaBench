    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem iter_S:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem involves Nat.iter, which is a function that applies a given function 'f' to an initial value 'x' 'n' times.\n   - We need to prove that applying 'f' once to 'x' and then iterating 'n' times is equivalent to iterating 'S n' (n+1) times on 'x'.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use induction on 'n' as the primary proof strategy.\n   - The base case will be when n = 0.\n   - The inductive step will involve proving for n+1 given it holds for n.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Start with induction on 'n'.\n   b. Base case (n = 0):\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of Nat.iter.\n      - Show that they are equivalent.\n   c. Inductive step:\n      - Assume the theorem holds for n (induction hypothesis).\n      - Prove it holds for S n.\n      - Use the definition of Nat.iter and the induction hypothesis.\n\n4. Key tactics to use:\n   - induction n: To start the induction on n.\n   - simpl: To simplify Nat.iter expressions.\n   - rewrite: To apply the induction hypothesis.\n   - reflexivity: To prove equality when both sides are identical.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the behavior of Nat.iter for different values of n.\n   - Correctly applying the induction hypothesis in the inductive step.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof is logically sound.\n   - Check that all cases (base and inductive) are covered.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem iter_S, focusing on induction as the main proof strategy and outlining the key steps and tactics to be used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by implementing the first steps of our planned approach. The key strategy is to use induction on 'n', as outlined in the planning section.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We need to begin the proof by introducing the universal quantifiers and setting up the induction on 'n'.\n\n2. The theorem statement involves forall quantifiers for A, n, f, and x. We should introduce these variables into our context.\n\n3. After introducing the variables, we should immediately apply induction on 'n' as this is the core of our proof strategy.\n\n4. Applying induction will generate two subgoals: the base case (n = 0) and the inductive step.\n\n5. This setup will allow us to tackle both the base case and the inductive step separately, following our proof outline.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on:\na) Introducing the universally quantified variables.\nb) Applying induction on 'n'.\n\nThese actions will set up the structure for the rest of the proof, allowing us to proceed with the base case and inductive step as planned.\n",
