    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem iter_S:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem involves Nat.iter, which is a function that applies a given function 'f' to an initial value 'x' 'n' times.\n   - We need to prove that applying 'f' once to 'x' and then iterating 'n' times is equivalent to iterating 'S n' (n+1) times on 'x'.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use induction on 'n' as the primary proof strategy.\n   - The base case will be when n = 0.\n   - The inductive step will involve proving for n+1 given it holds for n.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Start with induction on 'n'.\n   b. Base case (n = 0):\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of Nat.iter.\n      - Show that they are equivalent.\n   c. Inductive step:\n      - Assume the theorem holds for n (induction hypothesis).\n      - Prove it holds for S n.\n      - Use the definition of Nat.iter and the induction hypothesis.\n\n4. Key tactics to use:\n   - induction n: To start the induction on n.\n   - simpl: To simplify Nat.iter expressions.\n   - rewrite: To apply the induction hypothesis.\n   - reflexivity: To prove equality when both sides are identical.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the behavior of Nat.iter for different values of n.\n   - Correctly applying the induction hypothesis in the inductive step.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof is logically sound.\n   - Check that all cases (base and inductive) are covered.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem iter_S, focusing on induction as the main proof strategy and outlining the key steps and tactics to be used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof, we have successfully initiated the induction on n and now have two subgoals to prove: the base case (n = 0) and the inductive step (n = S n'). Let's reason about how to proceed with each case:\n\n1. Base case (n = 0):\n   We need to prove: Nat.iter 0 f (f x) = Nat.iter 1 f x\n   \n   Strategy:\n   - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of Nat.iter.\n   - For Nat.iter 0, it should return its second argument (f x) without applying f.\n   - For Nat.iter 1, it should apply f once to x.\n   - After simplification, both sides should be equivalent to (f x).\n\n2. Inductive step:\n   We need to prove: Nat.iter (S n') f (f x) = Nat.iter (S (S n')) f x\n   \n   Strategy:\n   - Use the induction hypothesis (IHn') which states that the theorem holds for n'.\n   - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of Nat.iter for S n' and S (S n').\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis to transform part of the left side into the right side.\n\nFor the acting agent, we should start by focusing on the base case. The reasoning suggests using simplification tactics to reduce both sides of the equation and then show their equality.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it did not properly set up the induction hypothesis or handle the base and inductive cases separately.\n\nImprovement: We should start the proof by using induction on n, then handle the base case and inductive case separately, using appropriate tactics for each case.\n```\n\nThe current approach tried to apply simplification and reflexivity directly to the main theorem, which doesn't work because the statement is too complex to be solved by simple reduction. The attempt to use an induction hypothesis (IHn') also failed because no induction was set up.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Start the proof with \"induction n\" to set up the base case and inductive step.\n2. For the base case (n = 0), use simpl to reduce both sides of the equation, then apply reflexivity.\n3. For the inductive step, use simpl to reduce both sides, then rewrite using the induction hypothesis, and finally apply reflexivity.\n\nThis structured approach will allow us to prove both cases of the induction and complete the theorem without using 'Admitted'. The acting agent should implement these steps in the next round, starting with the induction tactic.",
