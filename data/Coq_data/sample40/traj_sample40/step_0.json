    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for reverse_result_Leaf:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that if the reverse of a tree is a Leaf, then the original tree must also be a Leaf.\n   - This involves the tree data structure and the tree_reverse function.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use structural induction on the tree 't'.\n   - Consider two cases: when 't' is a Leaf and when 't' is a Node.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Base case: t = Leaf\n      - Show that tree_reverse Leaf = Leaf\n      - This case should be straightforward\n\n   b. Inductive case: t = Node l v r\n      - Assume the hypothesis holds for l and r (induction hypothesis)\n      - Show that tree_reverse (Node l v r) cannot be a Leaf\n      - This will lead to a contradiction with the assumption in the theorem statement\n\n4. Key steps:\n   - Introduce the tree 't' and the hypothesis (tree_reverse t = Leaf)\n   - Use destruct or induction tactic on 't'\n   - For the Leaf case, use reflexivity\n   - For the Node case, simplify tree_reverse (Node l v r)\n   - Show that the result cannot be Leaf, leading to a contradiction\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling the contradiction in the Node case\n   - Properly applying the induction hypothesis if needed\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros\n   - destruct or induction\n   - simpl\n   - rewrite\n   - discriminate (for showing Node â‰  Leaf)\n   - contradiction\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - The proof should show that the only way tree_reverse t can be Leaf is if t itself is Leaf.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the lemma reverse_result_Leaf, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduce the universal quantifier and the hypothesis:\n   We need to introduce the tree 't' and the hypothesis that (tree_reverse t = Leaf).\n\n2. Use structural induction on 't':\n   Since we're dealing with a recursive data structure (tree) and a recursive function (tree_reverse), structural induction is the most appropriate approach. This will allow us to consider both the base case (Leaf) and the inductive case (Node).\n\n3. Handle the base case (Leaf):\n   For the Leaf case, we need to show that the statement holds trivially. This should be straightforward as tree_reverse Leaf is defined to be Leaf.\n\n4. Handle the inductive case (Node):\n   For the Node case, we need to show that assuming tree_reverse (Node l v r) = Leaf leads to a contradiction. This is because tree_reverse of a Node always results in another Node, not a Leaf.\n\nGiven these considerations, I suggest the acting agent start with the following steps:\n\n1. Use the 'intros' tactic to introduce the tree 't' and the hypothesis.\n2. Apply the 'induction t' tactic to start the structural induction on 't'.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof structure and allow us to tackle both cases of the tree structure.\n",
