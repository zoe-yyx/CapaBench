Understand the given definitions:\n   - Zcomp: Composition of two functions\n   - is_fixpoint: Definition of a fixed point for a function\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - We need to prove that if x is a fixed point of (f ∘ f) and (f ∘ (f ∘ f)), then x is also a fixed point of f\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the given hypotheses:\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f f) x\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f (Zcomp f f)) x\n\n   b) Expand the definitions of is_fixpoint and Zcomp in the hypotheses\n\n   c) Use the expanded forms to show that f(x) = x:\n      - From (f ∘ f)(x) = x, we get f(f(x)) = x\n      - From (f ∘ (f ∘ f))(x) = x, we get f(f(f(x))) = x\n\n   d) Use these equalities to prove that f(x) = x:\n      - If f(f(x)) = x and f(f(f(x))) = x, then f(x) must equal x\n\n   e) Apply the definition of is_fixpoint to conclude the proof\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce the variables and hypotheses\n   - unfold: to expand the definitions of Zcomp and is_fixpoint\n   - rewrite: to use the equalities derived from the hypotheses\n   - reflexivity: to prove equality when both sides are identical\n\n5. Possible challenges:\n   - Keeping track of nested function applications\n   - Correctly applying the composition of functions\n\nThis plan should guide the player through the proof process, focusing on expanding definitions and using the given hypotheses to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem fixpoint_self_comp23, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduce the variables and hypotheses:\n   We need to introduce f and x, as well as the two hypotheses about x being a fixed point of (f ∘ f) and (f ∘ (f ∘ f)).\n\n2. Expand the definitions:\n   We should unfold the definitions of Zcomp and is_fixpoint to work with their explicit forms. This will help us understand what the hypotheses actually mean in terms of function applications.\n\n3. Derive key equalities:\n   From the expanded hypotheses, we can derive two important equalities:\n   - f(f(x)) = x (from the first hypothesis)\n   - f(f(f(x))) = x (from the second hypothesis)\n\n4. Use these equalities to prove f(x) = x:\n   We can use the derived equalities to show that f(x) must be equal to x. The reasoning is as follows:\n   - If f(f(x)) = x, then applying f to both sides gives us f(f(f(x))) = f(x)\n   - But we also know that f(f(f(x))) = x from the second hypothesis\n   - Therefore, f(x) = x\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   Once we have shown that f(x) = x, we can directly conclude that x is a fixed point of f, which is what we needed to prove.\n\nThe acting agent should start by introducing the variables and hypotheses, then proceed to unfold the definitions. After that, they should focus on deriving the key equalities and using them to prove that f(x) = x.\n",
