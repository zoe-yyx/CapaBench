Understand the given definitions:\n   - Zcomp: Composition of two functions\n   - is_fixpoint: Definition of a fixed point for a function\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - We need to prove that if x is a fixed point of (f ∘ f) and (f ∘ (f ∘ f)), then x is also a fixed point of f\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the given hypotheses:\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f f) x\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f (Zcomp f f)) x\n\n   b) Expand the definitions of is_fixpoint and Zcomp in the hypotheses\n\n   c) Use the expanded forms to show that f(x) = x:\n      - From (f ∘ f)(x) = x, we get f(f(x)) = x\n      - From (f ∘ (f ∘ f))(x) = x, we get f(f(f(x))) = x\n\n   d) Use these equalities to prove that f(x) = x:\n      - If f(f(x)) = x and f(f(f(x))) = x, then f(x) must equal x\n\n   e) Apply the definition of is_fixpoint to conclude the proof\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nTo properly set up the proof and avoid errors related to undefined variables or hypotheses, we should start with the following steps:\n\n1. Use 'intros' to bring the universally quantified variables and hypotheses into the context. This will give us access to 'f', 'x', and the two hypotheses about fixed points.\n\n2. Unfold the definitions of 'is_fixpoint' and 'Zcomp' in the hypotheses. This will reveal the actual equalities we're working with.\n\n3. After unfolding, we'll have two key equalities:\n   - f (f x) = x (from the first hypothesis)\n   - f (f (f x)) = x (from the second hypothesis)\n\n4. Our goal will be to prove that f x = x.\n\nBy setting up the proof environment correctly, we'll be able to use these equalities to construct a valid argument for the theorem. The next step should be to introduce the variables and hypotheses, then unfold the definitions to expose the core equalities we need to work with.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current outcome, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to incorrect application of tactics and assumptions about the existence of hypotheses that were not actually present in the context.\n\nImprovement: We need to carefully track the state of the proof environment, ensure each tactic is applicable before using it, and build the proof step-by-step without making assumptions about intermediate results.\n```\n\nLet's break down the issues and suggest improvements:\n\n1. The assertion `H3: f (f (f x)) = f x` was attempted, but the proof for this assertion failed. The `rewrite H2. reflexivity.` tactic sequence didn't work because after rewriting, we had `x = f x`, which is not reflexively true.\n\n2. The subsequent steps (rewriting with H1 and using exact H3) failed because H3 was never successfully proven and added to the context.\n\nFor the next attempt, we should:\n\n1. Start by clearly stating our given hypotheses and goal.\n2. Instead of trying to prove `f (f (f x)) = f x` directly, we should use the given hypotheses more carefully.\n3. We might try a different approach, such as:\n   - Use H2 to replace f (f (f x)) with x in the goal.\n   - Then use H1 to replace f (f x) with x.\n   - This should lead us to the desired conclusion.\n\nThe reasoning agent should focus on understanding the relationships between the given equations and how they can be combined to reach the goal. The acting agent should then implement these steps carefully, checking the proof state after each tactic to ensure it's progressing as expected.",
