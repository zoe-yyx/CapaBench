Understand the given definitions:\n   - Zcomp: Composition of two functions\n   - is_fixpoint: Definition of a fixed point for a function\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - We need to prove that if x is a fixed point of (f ∘ f) and (f ∘ (f ∘ f)), then x is also a fixed point of f\n\n3.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof, we have made good progress. We have introduced the variables and hypotheses, and we have unfolded the definitions of `is_fixpoint` and `Zcomp`. Now we have two key equations:\n\n1. H1: f (f x) = x\n2. H2: f (f (f x)) = x\n\nOur goal is to prove that f x = x.\n\nTo proceed, we can use these equations to show that f x must be equal to x. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. From H1, we know that applying f twice to x gives us back x.\n2. From H2, we know that applying f three times to x also gives us back x.\n3. If we apply f to both sides of H1, we get:\n   f (f (f x)) = f x\n4. But we know from H2 that f (f (f x)) = x\n5. Therefore, f x must be equal to x\n\nTo implement this reasoning, we should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Apply f to both sides of H1\n2. Rewrite using H2\n3. Use transitivity of equality to conclude that f x = x\n\nThis approach should lead us directly to our goal.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it tried to use hypotheses and variables that were not yet introduced in the current context.\n\nImprovement: Begin by properly introducing the variables and hypotheses using 'intros', then unfold the definitions of 'is_fixpoint' and 'Zcomp' before proceeding with the proof steps.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the main issue in the previous attempt was jumping directly into complex proof steps without properly setting up the initial context. This led to errors where the proof referred to variables and hypotheses that didn't exist yet.\n\nTo improve the approach, we should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Start with 'intros' to bring the universal quantifiers into the context.\n2. Unfold the definitions of 'is_fixpoint' and 'Zcomp' to expose the underlying equalities.\n3. Only then proceed with the logical steps of the proof.\n\nThis more structured approach will ensure that all necessary elements are in place before we attempt to use them, avoiding the errors we encountered. It will also make the proof more clear and easier to follow.\n\nFor the next round, we should suggest starting with these basic setup steps before moving on to the core logic of the proof. This will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent reasoning and actions.",
