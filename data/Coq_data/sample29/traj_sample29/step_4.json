Understand the given definitions:\n   - Zcomp: Composition of two functions\n   - is_fixpoint: Definition of a fixed point for a function\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - We need to prove that if x is a fixed point of (f ∘ f) and (f ∘ (f ∘ f)), then x is also a fixed point of f\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the given hypotheses:\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f f) x\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f (Zcomp f f)) x\n\n   b) Expand the definitions of is_fixpoint and Zcomp in the hypotheses\n\n   c) Use the expanded forms to show that f(x) = x:\n      - From (f ∘ f)(x) = x, we get f(f(x)) = x\n      - From (f ∘ (f ∘ f))(x) = x, we get f(f(f(x))) = x\n\n   d) Use these equalities to prove that f(x) = x:\n      - If f(f(x)) = x and f(f(f(x))) = x, then f(x) must equal x\n\n   e) Apply the definition of is_fixpoint to conclude the proof\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce the variables and hypotheses\n   - unfold: to expand the definitions of Zcomp and is_fixpoint\n   - rewrite: to use the equalities derived from the hypotheses\n   - reflexivity: to prove equality when both sides are identical\n\n5. Possible challenges:\n   - Keeping track of nested function applications\n   - Correctly applying the composition of functions\n\nThis plan should guide the player through the proof process, focusing on expanding definitions and using the given hypotheses to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt has led to a complex goal that cannot be solved directly. We need to simplify our approach by using the hypotheses more effectively. Let's start fresh with a new strategy:\n\n1. We have already introduced the variables and unfolded the definitions, which was correct. We should keep these steps.\n\n2. Our goal is to prove: f x = x\n\n3. We have two key hypotheses:\n   H1: f (f x) = x\n   H2: f (f (f x)) = x\n\n4. We can use these hypotheses to transform our goal into a trivial equality:\n   - First, let's rewrite the left side of our goal (f x) using H2. This will replace f x with f (f (f x)).\n   - Then, we can use H1 to simplify f (f (f x)) to x.\n\n5. After these transformations, our goal should become x = x, which can be solved by reflexivity.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the following sequence of tactics:\n\n1. rewrite <- H2.\n   This will change the goal to: f (f (f x)) = x\n\n2. rewrite H1.\n   This will simplify the goal to: x = x\n\n3. reflexivity.\n   This should solve the goal.\n\nThis approach directly uses the given hypotheses to transform the goal into a trivial equality, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The current proof strategy led to an unsolvable goal due to incorrect application of hypotheses, resulting in the inability to unify \"f x\" with \"f (f x)\".\n\nImprovement: We should revise our approach by using the hypotheses more strategically, possibly by first rewriting with H1 to simplify f (f x) to x, then using H2 to establish the equality we need.\n```\n\nUpon reflection, our previous approach was flawed because we didn't use the hypotheses in the most effective order. Let's analyze why:\n\n1. We started by rewriting with H2 (f (f (f x)) = x), which introduced an extra application of f that we couldn't eliminate.\n\n2. Then we used H1 (f (f x) = x), but this didn't simplify our goal enough to reach the desired equality.\n\n3. The final goal (f (f x) = f x) couldn't be solved by reflexivity because these terms are not syntactically equal.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should:\n\n1. Start by using H1 to simplify f (f x) to x wherever it appears.\n\n2. Then use H2, which after the previous step should become f x = x, which is exactly what we need to prove.\n\n3. If needed, we can use transitivity of equality to connect these steps.\n\nFor the next attempt, I suggest the following sequence of tactics:\n\n1. rewrite H1 in H2.\n   This should simplify H2 to: f x = x\n\n2. exact H2.\n   This should solve the goal directly.\n\nThis revised strategy uses the hypotheses more effectively, simplifying the proof and avoiding the introduction of unnecessary complexity.",
