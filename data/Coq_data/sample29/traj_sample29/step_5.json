Understand the given definitions:\n   - Zcomp: Composition of two functions\n   - is_fixpoint: Definition of a fixed point for a function\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - We need to prove that if x is a fixed point of (f ∘ f) and (f ∘ (f ∘ f)), then x is also a fixed point of f\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a) Start with the given hypotheses:\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f f) x\n      - is_fixpoint (Zcomp f (Zcomp f f)) x\n\n   b) Expand the definitions of is_fixpoint and Zcomp in the hypotheses\n\n   c) Use the expanded forms to show that f(x) = x:\n      - From (f ∘ f)(x) = x, we get f(f(x)) = x\n      - From (f ∘ (f ∘ f))(x) = x, we get f(f(f(x))) = x\n\n   d) Use these equalities to prove that f(x) = x:\n      - If f(f(x)) = x and f(f(f(x))) = x, then f(x) must equal x\n\n   e) Apply the definition of is_fixpoint to conclude the proof\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce the variables and hypotheses\n   - unfold: to expand the definitions of Zcomp and is_fixpoint\n   - rewrite: to use the equalities derived from the hypotheses\n   - reflexivity: to prove equality when both sides are identical\n\n5. Possible challenges:\n   - Keeping track of nested function applications\n   - Correctly applying the composition of functions\n\nThis plan should guide the player through the proof process, focusing on expanding definitions and using the given hypotheses to reach the desired conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nOur previous approach led to an unsolvable goal. We need to revise our strategy to use the hypotheses more effectively. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have two key hypotheses:\n   H1: f (f x) = x\n   H2: f (f (f x)) = x\n\n2. Our goal is to prove: f x = x\n\n3. We can use H1 to simplify H2. By replacing f (f x) with x in H2, we'll get exactly what we need to prove.\n\n4. The sequence of operations should be:\n   a) Rewrite using H1 in H2. This will simplify H2 to: f x = x\n   b) Then, the simplified H2 will be exactly our goal, so we can use it directly to prove the theorem.\n\n5. This approach avoids introducing unnecessary complexity and uses our hypotheses in the most straightforward way to reach our goal.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the following tactics:\n1. rewrite H1 in H2.\n2. exact H2.\n\nThese steps should complete the proof efficiently by using our hypotheses to directly establish the required equality.\n",
