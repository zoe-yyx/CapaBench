Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The theorem is named \"or_intror\"\n   - It has two propositions A and B as parameters\n   - It states that if B is true, then A \\/ B (A or B) is true\n\n2. Identify the proof strategy:\n   - This is a basic logical theorem about disjunction (logical OR)\n   - We need to prove that the right-hand side of the disjunction is sufficient to prove the entire disjunction\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   3.1. Start with the standard proof structure:\n        - intros A B HB\n        - This introduces A and B as propositions and HB as the hypothesis that B is true\n   \n   3.2. Use the right introduction rule for disjunction:\n        - Apply the 'right' tactic\n        - This will change our goal from (A \\/ B) to just B\n\n   3.3. Use the hypothesis:\n        - Apply the hypothesis HB\n        - This should complete the proof as we now have evidence for B\n\n4. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure that all goals are solved\n   - Check that no assumptions are left unused\n\n5. Consider alternatives:\n   - While this direct approach should work, be prepared to use other tactics if needed\n   - Tactics like 'auto', 'tauto', or 'firstorder' might solve this automatically, but understanding the step-by-step proof is valuable\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are starting the proof for the theorem \"or_intror\", which states that for any propositions A and B, if B is true, then A \\/ B is true, we should begin with the standard proof structure as outlined in the planning strategy.\n\nThe first step should be to introduce the propositions A and B, as well as the hypothesis that B is true. This sets up our proof environment with the necessary components to work with.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by using the 'intros' tactic to bring these elements into our proof context. This will allow us to refer to them in subsequent steps of the proof.\n\nAfter this introduction, we'll have A and B as propositions in our context, and a hypothesis (let's call it HB) that represents the truth of B. This will prepare us for the next steps of applying the right introduction rule for disjunction and using the hypothesis to complete the proof.\n",
