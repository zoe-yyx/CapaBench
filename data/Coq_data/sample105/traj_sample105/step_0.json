    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for mul_comm:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplication is commutative for natural numbers.\n   - We need to show that for any two natural numbers n and m, mul n m = mul m n.\n\n2. Analyze Available Resources:\n   - We have definitions for natural numbers (nat), addition (add), and multiplication (mul).\n   - Three important theorems/lemmas are already proved:\n     a) add_comm: addition is commutative\n     b) mul_0_r: multiplication by 0 on the right gives 0\n     c) mul_succ_r: relates multiplication by (S m) to multiplication by m\n\n3. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a) Use induction on one of the variables (let's choose n).\n   b) For the base case (n = O), use mul_0_r.\n   c) For the inductive step (n = S n'), we'll need to:\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use mul_succ_r to rewrite the left side\n      - Use add_comm to swap terms\n      - Apply mul_succ_r again in the reverse direction\n\n4. Detailed Proof Steps:\n   a) Start with induction on n.\n   b) Base case (n = O):\n      - Show mul O m = mul m O\n      - Use the definition of mul and mul_0_r\n   c) Inductive step (n = S n'):\n      - Need to prove: mul (S n') m = mul m (S n')\n      - Rewrite left side using definition of mul\n      - Apply induction hypothesis to sub-term (mul n' m)\n      - Use mul_succ_r to rewrite right side\n      - Apply add_comm to swap terms\n      - Rewrite back using mul_succ_r in reverse\n\n5. Potential Challenges:\n   - Correctly applying mul_succ_r and add_comm may require careful rewriting\n   - Ensuring all terms are properly aligned for the final equality\n\n6. Verification:\n   - At each step, ensure the equality holds\n   - Double-check that all cases (O and S n') are covered\n   - Verify that all used lemmas are applied correctly\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving mul_comm, utilizing the given definitions and lemmas effectively.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We should start by initiating the proof and setting up induction on n. This is in line with our plan to use induction as the primary proof strategy.\n\n2. The induction will give us two cases to prove: the base case where n = O, and the inductive step where n = S n'.\n\n3. For the base case (n = O), we'll need to show that mul O m = mul m O. This should be relatively straightforward using the definition of mul and the mul_0_r lemma.\n\n4. For the inductive step (n = S n'), we'll need to prove that mul (S n') m = mul m (S n'). This will be more complex and will require using the induction hypothesis, mul_succ_r, and add_comm.\n\n5. We should be prepared to use rewriting tactics frequently, especially with the mul_succ_r lemma, as it will be crucial for manipulating the expressions involving S n'.\n\n6. The add_comm lemma will be important for rearranging terms to match the desired equality.\n\n7. We may need to unfold the definition of mul at some points to expose the underlying structure of the expressions.\n\n8. Throughout the proof, we should keep track of our goal and ensure that each step brings us closer to showing the equality mul n m = mul m n for all n and m.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by setting up the induction on n and then proceed to tackle the base case. After that, we can guide them through the more complex inductive step.\n",
