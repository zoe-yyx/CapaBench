Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that reversing tree_example3a results in tree_example3b.\n   - We need to use the tree_reverse function defined in the problem.\n\n2. Analyze the structures:\n   - Examine the structures of tree_example3a and tree_example3b.\n   - Identify the relationships between tree_example2a, tree_example2b, and the larger trees.\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Unfold the definitions of tree_example3a and tree_example3b.\n   b. Apply the tree_reverse function to tree_example3a.\n   c. Simplify the tree_reverse application using the function definition.\n   d. Show that the resulting structure matches tree_example3b.\n\n4. Step-by-step approach:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of tree_example3a.\n   - Apply tree_reverse to this unfolded structure.\n   - Simplify the tree_reverse application on each level of the tree.\n   - Unfold the definition of tree_example3b.\n   - Compare the resulting structures to show they are equal.\n\n5.

Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold: To expand definitions of tree examples.\n   - simpl: To simplify applications of tree_reverse.\n   - rewrite: If any helper lemmas about tree_reverse are available.\n   - reflexivity: To prove equality when the structures match.\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem tree_example3_tree_reverse, we should follow the step-by-step approach outlined in the planning strategy. The first step is to unfold the definitions of tree_example3a and tree_example3b to understand their structures better.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should start by unfolding the definition of tree_example3a. This will reveal its structure and allow us to apply the tree_reverse function to it.\n\n2. After unfolding tree_example3a, we'll see that it contains tree_example2a as a subtree. We might need to unfold this as well to fully expose the structure.\n\n3. Once the structure is clear, we can apply the tree_reverse function to this unfolded structure. This will involve using the definition of tree_reverse on each level of the tree.\n\n4. As we apply tree_reverse, we should simplify the expressions at each step. This will help us see how the tree structure is changing.\n\n5. After fully reversing and simplifying tree_example3a, we should then unfold the definition of tree_example3b to compare the structures.\n\n6. If the structures match after these steps, we can conclude the proof with reflexivity.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on unfolding definitions and applying tree_reverse, using tactics like 'unfold' and 'simpl' as necessary. If the proof becomes complex, we may need to break it down into smaller steps or consider introducing helper lemmas about the properties of tree_reverse, especially regarding its effect on tree_example2a and tree_example2b.\n",
