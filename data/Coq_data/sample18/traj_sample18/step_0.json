    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by following the initial steps of our planning strategy. Our first actions should focus on setting up the proof and expanding the definitions to work with the concrete expressions.\n\n1. We should begin by introducing the functions f and g as variables in our proof. This will allow us to work with these arbitrary functions throughout the proof.\n\n2. After introducing the functions, we should expand the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus. This will give us the concrete expressions we need to work with and compare.\n\n3. To prove function equality, we need to show that the functions are equal for all inputs. Therefore, we should introduce an arbitrary input x.\n\n4. Once we have expanded the definitions and introduced all necessary variables, we'll be in a position to start simplifying and comparing the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation.\n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend that the acting agent start with the following steps:\n\n1. Introduce f and g\n2. Unfold the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus\n3. Introduce an arbitrary input x\n\nThis will set up the proof environment and allow us to proceed with the more detailed steps of simplification and equality demonstration in the subsequent stages.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was correct, but the final step of introducing x was unnecessary and caused an error.\n\nImprovement: Skip the introduction of x and proceed directly to proving the equality of the functions using extensionality or by showing they produce the same output for all inputs.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that our initial approach was largely correct, but we encountered an issue at the final step. Let's break down what happened:\n\n1. We successfully introduced the functions f and g.\n2. We correctly unfolded the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus.\n3. The error occurred when we tried to introduce x, which was unnecessary at this stage.\n\nAfter unfolding the definitions, we can see that both sides of the equation are already equivalent:\n\n(fun x : Z => f (x + 1) + g (x + 1)) = (fun x : Z => f (x + 1) + g (x + 1))\n\nThis equality is true by definition, and we don't need to introduce x to prove it. Instead, we should focus on proving this functional equality.\n\nFor the next steps, we should consider:\n\n1. Using the principle of functional extensionality to prove that these functions are equal. This principle states that two functions are equal if they produce the same output for all inputs.\n\n2. If functional extensionality is not available or preferred, we could introduce x at a later stage to show that both sides produce the same result for any input x.\n\n3. Alternatively, we might be able to use reflexivity directly, as the two sides are syntactically identical after unfolding.\n\nThe acting agent should consider these options and choose the most appropriate next step based on the available tactics and the preferred proof style.",
