Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1\n   - Recognize that func_plus combines two functions by addition\n   - Note that shift_left1 shifts the input of a function by 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros f g\" to introduce the functions\n   - Use \"unfold shift_left1, func_plus\" to expand the definitions\n\n3. Prove function equality:\n   - Use the extensionality principle: prove equality for all inputs\n   - Add \"intros x\" to introduce an arbitrary input\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection, here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've successfully introduced the functions f and g and unfolded the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus. This has resulted in an equality between two functions that are syntactically identical.\n\n2. The current goal is to prove:\n   (fun x : Z => f (x + 1) + g (x + 1)) = (fun x : Z => f (x + 1) + g (x + 1))\n\n3. Given that both sides of the equation are identical, we can prove this equality directly without introducing any additional variables or using extensionality.\n\n4. The simplest and most direct approach at this point would be to apply the reflexivity tactic. Reflexivity is used to prove goals of the form t = t, where both sides are syntactically identical.\n\n5. Using reflexivity here will complete the proof in one step, as it will recognize that both sides of the equation are exactly the same.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in the proof should be to apply the reflexivity tactic. This will effectively prove the lemma without any need for further steps or complications.\n",
