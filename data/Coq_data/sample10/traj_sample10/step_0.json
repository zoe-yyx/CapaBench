Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving the example 'smul_ex1', which states that smul 1 1 = 3.\n   - The 'smul' function is defined as smul x y := x * y + x + y.\n\n2. Plan the proof steps:\n   a) Begin the proof by stating the theorem 'smul_ex1'.\n   b) Unfold the definition of 'smul' in the goal.\n   c) Simplify the arithmetic expression.\n   d) Compare the resulting expression with the expected result.\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   - Use computational tactics to simplify and solve the arithmetic.\n   - Possible tactics to consider: unfold, simpl, reflexivity.\n\n4. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof is correctly applied.\n   - Confirm that the final result matches the expected outcome of 3.\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - The arithmetic is straightforward, so no major challenges are anticipated.\n   - Be cautious of implicit type conversions between nat and Z.\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem smul_ex1, which states that smul 1 1 = 3, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin the proof by stating the theorem. This has likely already been done for us in the problem setup.\n\n2. Our next step should be to unfold the definition of 'smul'. This will expand the function call smul 1 1 into its arithmetic expression.\n\n3. After unfolding, we'll need to simplify the resulting arithmetic expression. The expression should be straightforward: 1 * 1 + 1 + 1.\n\n4. Once simplified, we should have a direct equality between the computed value and 3.\n\n5. Finally, we can use reflexivity to prove that the equality holds.\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, the acting agent should start by unfolding the definition of 'smul'. This will give us the concrete arithmetic expression to work with in subsequent steps.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to use the 'unfold' tactic on 'smul'.\n",
