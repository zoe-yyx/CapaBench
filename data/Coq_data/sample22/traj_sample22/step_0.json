Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplication (*) is associative for integers (Z).\n   - We need to use the definition of 'assoc' provided.\n\n2. Unfold the definition:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' in the context of multiplication.\n   - This will give us the actual statement we need to prove.\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce three arbitrary integers x, y, and z.\n   - Our goal will be to show: x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z\n\n4. Use algebraic properties:\n   - Multiplication of integers is known to be associative, but we need to prove it formally.\n   - We can use the built-in properties of Z (integer) multiplication.\n\n5. Apply Coq tactics:\n   - Use 'intros' to bring x, y, and z into the context.\n   - Use 'unfold assoc' to expand the definition.\n   - Use 'simpl' or 'cbn' to simplify the expressions if needed.\n\n6. Prove equality:\n   - The left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation should be equal by the associativity of integer multiplication.\n   - We can use 'reflexivity' if Coq recognizes the equality automatically.\n\n7. If 'reflexivity' doesn't work:\n   - We might need to use 'ring' tactic, which is powerful for proving algebraic equalities.\n   - Alternatively, we could use 'rewrite' with appropriate lemmas about Z multiplication if needed.\n\n8. Complete the proof:\n   - Once the equality is proven, use 'Qed' to finish the proof.\n\n9. If stuck:\n   - Consider using 'lia' (Linear Integer Arithmetic) tactic, which can solve many integer equalities automatically.\n   - As a last resort, we could use 'admit' to skip a difficult step, but this should be avoided if possible.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem mult_assoc, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by stating the theorem and beginning the proof.\n\n2. Unfold the definition of 'assoc' to reveal the specific statement we need to prove for multiplication. This will give us a clear goal to work towards.\n\n3. Introduce the variables x, y, and z as arbitrary integers, as required by the definition of 'assoc'.\n\n4. After unfolding and introducing variables, we should have a goal that equates x * (y * z) with (x * y) * z.\n\n5. Since this is a basic property of integer multiplication, we can attempt to prove it using the 'ring' tactic, which is designed to handle such algebraic equalities.\n\n6. If 'ring' doesn't work for some reason, we can fall back to using the 'lia' tactic, which is powerful for integer arithmetic.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these initial steps to set up the proof and attempt to solve it using algebraic tactics. This approach aligns with our planning strategy and should effectively start the proof process.\n",
