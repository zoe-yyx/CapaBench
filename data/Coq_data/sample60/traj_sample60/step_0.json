Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if there exists an x that satisfies both P and Q, then there exists an x that satisfies P AND there exists an x that satisfies Q.\n   - This is a distributive property of existence over conjunction.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to bring the hypothesis into the context.\n   - Destruct the existential hypothesis to get a witness and the conjunction.\n   - Split the goal into two parts: (exists x, P x) and (exists x, Q x).\n   - Prove each part separately using the same witness from the hypothesis.\n\n3. Detailed steps:\n   a. Start with \"intros X P Q H\" to introduce the variables and hypothesis.\n   b. Use \"destruct H as [x [HP HQ]]\" to break down the existential hypothesis.\n   c. Apply \"split\" tactic to separate the goal into two subgoals.\n   d. For the first subgoal (exists x, P x):\n      - Use \"exists x\" to provide the witness.\n      - Apply HP to prove P x.\n   e. For the second subgoal (exists x, Q x):\n      - Use \"exists x\" to provide the witness.\n      - Apply HQ to prove Q x.\n\n4. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all subgoals are solved.\n   - Use \"Qed\" to complete the proof.\n\n5. Key points to remember:\n   - The same witness x works for both parts of the conclusion.\n   - The conjunction in the hypothesis gives us both P x and Q x, which we can use directly.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by following the plan outlined in the planning strategy. The first step is to introduce the variables and hypothesis into our context. This will allow us to work with the given information and set up the proof structure.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to start by introducing the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis. This corresponds to step 3a in our plan.\n2. The theorem has a universally quantified type X, two predicates P and Q, and a hypothesis about existence.\n3. Introducing these elements will give us a solid foundation to work with for the rest of the proof.\n4. After introduction, we'll have a hypothesis that we can then destruct to get our witness and the conjunction of P and Q applied to that witness.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the \"intros\" tactic to bring the variables X, P, Q, and the hypothesis into our context. This will set us up for the subsequent steps in our proof strategy.\n",
