Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that the height of a reversed tree is equal to the height of the original tree.\n   - We need to prove this for all possible tree structures.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Structural induction on the tree 't' seems most appropriate, as tree operations are defined recursively.\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin with 'intros t' to introduce the tree variable.\n   - Use 'induction t' to start the structural induction.\n\n4. Base case (Leaf):\n   - For the Leaf case, both sides of the equality should simplify to 0.\n   - This case should be straightforward and possibly solved automatically.\n\n5. Inductive case (Node):\n   - For the Node case, we'll have:\n     * Induction hypotheses for left and right subtrees\n     * Need to show equality for Node (tree_reverse r) v (tree_reverse l)\n\n6. Simplify expressions:\n   - Expand definitions of tree_reverse and tree_height for the Node case.\n   - Use the induction hypotheses to replace heights of reversed subtrees.\n\n7. Prove equality:\n   - Show that max(height(r), height(l)) + 1 = max(height(l), height(r)) + 1\n   - This equality should hold because max is commutative.\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the initial steps of our proving plan. The first logical step is to introduce the tree variable and set up the structural induction.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to start by introducing the variable 't' which represents our tree. This is done using the 'intros' tactic.\n\n2. After introducing 't', we should immediately set up the structural induction on 't'. This is crucial because our definitions of tree_reverse and tree_height are recursive, and induction will allow us to prove the theorem for all possible tree structures.\n\n3. Using induction will generate two cases for us to prove:\n   - Base case: When 't' is a Leaf\n   - Inductive case: When 't' is a Node, with induction hypotheses for its subtrees\n\n4. Once the induction is set up, we'll be in a position to tackle each case separately, starting with the simpler Leaf case.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should be guided to use the 'intros' tactic followed by the 'induction' tactic on 't'. This will set up the structure for the rest of our proof and allow us to proceed with the individual cases.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof failed because Z.max(a, b) is not automatically recognized as equal to Z.max(b, a) by Coq's reflexivity tactic.\n\nImprovement: We should explicitly prove that Z.max is commutative before applying it to our specific case, or use a tactic that can handle this equality automatically, such as 'lia' from the Psatz library.\n```\n\nThe proof was almost complete, but it stumbled at the final step of the Node case. The issue arose because Coq doesn't automatically recognize that Z.max(a, b) = Z.max(b, a) for all a and b. This property, known as commutativity of max, needs to be explicitly stated or proven.\n\nTo improve our approach, we have several options:\n\n1. We can prove a lemma about the commutativity of Z.max before using it in our main proof.\n2. We can use the 'lia' tactic from the Psatz library, which is capable of solving linear integer arithmetic problems, including inequalities involving max.\n3. We can use the 'rewrite Z.max_comm' tactic, which applies the commutativity of Z.max directly.\n\nFor the next attempt, I recommend using the 'lia' tactic as it's the most straightforward solution given we've already imported the Psatz library. The acting agent should replace the final 'reflexivity' with 'lia'.\n\nIf 'lia' doesn't work for some reason, we should fall back to proving the commutativity of Z.max as a separate lemma and then applying it in our main proof.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that our proof structure is correct, and we've successfully handled both the base case (Leaf) and set up the inductive case (Node) correctly. We just need this small adjustment to complete the proof.",
