    "planning_context": "\nProving Plan for reverse_height theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that the height of a reversed tree is equal to the height of the original tree.\n   - We need to prove this for all possible tree structures.\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Structural induction on the tree 't' seems most appropriate, as tree operations are defined recursively.\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin with 'intros t' to introduce the tree variable.\n   - Use 'induction t' to start the structural induction.\n\n4. Base case (Leaf):\n   - For the Leaf case, both sides of the equality should simplify to 0.\n   - This case should be straightforward and possibly solved automatically.\n\n5. Inductive case (Node):\n   - For the Node case, we'll have:\n     * Induction hypotheses for left and right subtrees\n     * Need to show equality for Node (tree_reverse r) v (tree_reverse l)\n\n6. Simplify expressions:\n   - Expand definitions of tree_reverse and tree_height for the Node case.\n   - Use the induction hypotheses to replace heights of reversed subtrees.\n\n7. Prove equality:\n   - Show that max(height(r), height(l)) + 1 = max(height(l), height(r)) + 1\n   - This equality should hold because max is commutative.\n\n8. Handle potential automation:\n   - Some steps might be solved automatically by Coq's built-in tactics.\n   - Be prepared to use lia or omega for arithmetic reasoning if needed.\n\n9. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the theorem is fully proved.\n   - Use 'Qed' to complete the proof.\n\n10. Reflect on the proof:\n    - Consider if any lemmas could make the proof cleaner or more modular.\n    - Think about how this theorem might be useful for future proofs about tree operations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next step:\n\n1. We've successfully proven the base case (Leaf) and set up the inductive case (Node) correctly.\n2. The final step in the Node case failed because Coq doesn't automatically recognize the commutativity of Z.max.\n3. We have the Psatz library imported, which provides the powerful 'lia' tactic for solving linear integer arithmetic problems.\n4. The 'lia' tactic should be able to handle the equality involving Z.max that we're trying to prove.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to replace the failed 'reflexivity' tactic with 'lia'. This should complete the proof by automatically handling the commutativity of Z.max and solving the remaining arithmetic equality.\n\nIf 'lia' doesn't work for some reason, we should consider proving a lemma about the commutativity of Z.max or using the 'rewrite Z.max_comm' tactic. However, 'lia' should be sufficient and is the most straightforward solution given our current setup.\n",
