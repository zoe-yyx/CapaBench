Understand the Problem:\n   - Recognize that we need to prove the theorem 'treeexample3b_size', which states that the size of tree_example3b is 5.\n   - Note that tree_size is a recursive function that counts the number of nodes in a tree.\n\n2. Analyze the Definitions:\n   - Examine the definition of tree_example3b, which is constructed using tree_example2b.\n   - Break down tree_example2b to understand its structure.\n\n3. Approach:\n   - Use a step-by-step calculation to compute the size of tree_example3b.\n   - Utilize the definition of tree_size function for each step.\n\n4. Proof Strategy:\n   a) Start with the goal: tree_size tree_example3b = 5\n   b) Unfold the definition of tree_example3b\n   c) Apply the tree_size function to the unfolded structure\n   d) Simplify by calculating the size of tree_example2b first\n   e) Continue simplifying until we reach the final result\n\n5. Key Steps:\n   - Use 'unfold' tactic to expand definitions of tree_example3b and tree_example2b\n   - Use 'simpl' tactic to calculate tree_size at each step\n   - Use 'rewrite' or '=' to show intermediate equalities\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem 'treeexample3b_size', we should start by unfolding the definitions of tree_example3b and tree_example2b. This will allow us to see the full structure of the tree we're working with.\n\nThe first step should be to use the 'unfold' tactic on tree_example3b. This will reveal that tree_example3b is constructed using tree_example2b and a smaller subtree.\n\nAfter unfolding tree_example3b, we should then unfold tree_example2b to see its complete structure.\n\nOnce the tree structure is fully expanded, we can start applying the tree_size function. The tree_size function is recursive, so we'll need to calculate it from the innermost nodes outward.\n\nWe should use the 'simpl' tactic to calculate the tree_size at each step. This will involve adding up the sizes of the left and right subtrees, plus 1 for each node.\n\nAs we proceed, we may need to use the 'rewrite' tactic or '=' to show intermediate equalities and simplify our expressions.\n\nThe goal is to methodically break down the problem until we reach a point where we can use 'reflexivity' to show that the calculated size equals 5.\n\nLet's start by unfolding the definition of tree_example3b and then proceed step by step from there.\n",
