    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove the lemma Node_inj_right, which states that if two Node constructors are equal, their right subtrees are equal.\n   - The tree datatype is defined with Leaf and Node constructors.\n   - The Node constructor takes three arguments: left subtree, value, and right subtree.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to introduce the variables into the context.\n   - Apply inversion or injection on the equality hypothesis.\n   - Use the generated equalities to prove the goal.\n\n3. Detailed steps:\n   a. Begin with 'intros' to bring all variables and the equality hypothesis into the context.\n   b. Use 'injection' tactic on the equality hypothesis to extract equalities for each component of the Node constructor.\n   c. Among the generated equalities, there will be one stating that r1 = r2.\n   d. Use this equality to solve the goal directly.\n\n4. Possible challenges:\n   - Dealing with the other equalities generated by injection that are not needed for this specific proof.\n   - Ensuring that the correct equality (r1 = r2) is identified and used.\n\n5. Alternative approaches:\n   - If 'injection' doesn't work as expected, consider using 'inversion' instead, which might provide a more detailed breakdown of the equality.\n\n6. Finishing the proof:\n   - After applying the key equality, the proof should be complete.\n   - Use 'reflexivity' or 'assumption' to close the proof.\n\n7. Optimization:\n   - The proof should be relatively straightforward, so aim for a concise sequence of tactics.\n   - Avoid introducing unnecessary steps or over-complicating the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the lemma Node_inj_right, our first step should be to introduce all the variables and the equality hypothesis into the context. This will set up the proof environment and allow us to work with the specific instances of the Node constructor.\n\nAfter introducing the variables, we should apply the injection tactic to the equality hypothesis. This tactic is particularly useful when dealing with constructors like Node, as it will generate separate equalities for each component of the constructor.\n\nThe key equality we're looking for is r1 = r2, which should be directly generated by the injection tactic. Once we have this equality, we can use it to prove our goal immediately.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following sequence of actions for the acting agent:\n\n1. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring all variables and the equality hypothesis into the context.\n2. Apply the 'injection' tactic to the equality hypothesis.\n3. Identify and use the generated equality r1 = r2 to solve the goal.\n\nThis approach follows our planned proof structure and should lead to a concise and direct proof of the lemma.\n",
