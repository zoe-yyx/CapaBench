    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if there does not exist an x of type X for which P x is true, then for all x of type X, P x is false.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the existential quantifier's definition.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros X P H x\".\n   - This introduces the type X, the predicate P, the hypothesis H (which states that there does not exist an x for which P x is true), and an arbitrary x of type X.\n\n3. Transform the goal:\n   - The goal will be \"~ P x\".\n   - Use \"unfold not\" to expand this into \"P x -> False\".\n\n4. Proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume \"P x\" is true (introduce this assumption).\n   - Our goal will be to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis H.\n\n5. Construct the contradiction:\n   - Use the \"exists\" tactic to show that there exists an x for which P x is true.\n   - This directly contradicts the hypothesis H.\n\n6. Complete the proof:\n   - Apply the contradiction to H to finish the proof.\n\n7. Key tactics to use:\n   - intros\n   - unfold not\n   - intro (for assuming P x)\n   - exists\n   - apply\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the logical negation of existential quantifiers.\n   - Correctly manipulating the hypothesis and goal to reach the contradiction.\n\n9. Additional notes:\n   - This proof doesn't require any of the imported libraries, but they might be useful for more complex problems or alternative proof strategies.\n   - The classical logic library (Classical_Prop) could provide an alternative proof path if needed, but a constructive proof is possible and preferable here.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof strategy has been correct up to this point, but we encountered an error in the final step. Let's adjust our approach to complete the proof:\n\n1. Our current goal is to prove 'P x', but we don't have direct evidence for this.\n2. We do have HP: '~ (P x -> False)', which means that assuming 'P x -> False' leads to a contradiction.\n3. We can use this to our advantage by introducing a new hypothesis 'P x -> False' and then deriving a contradiction.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce a new hypothesis assuming 'P x -> False'. This will allow us to work towards a contradiction.\n2. Apply HP to this new hypothesis. Since HP is '~ (P x -> False)', this should immediately lead to False, completing our proof.\n3. The exact tactic to use for the new hypothesis should match the goal we're trying to prove, which is 'P x -> False'.\n\nThese steps will effectively use classical logic to show that '~ ~ (P x -> False)' implies 'P x', which is what we need to complete the proof.\n",
