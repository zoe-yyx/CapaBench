    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if there does not exist an x of type X for which P x is true, then for all x of type X, P x is false.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the existential quantifier's definition.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros X P H x\".\n   - This introduces the type X, the predicate P, the hypothesis H (which states that there does not exist an x for which P x is true), and an arbitrary x of type X.\n\n3. Transform the goal:\n   - The goal will be \"~ P x\".\n   - Use \"unfold not\" to expand this into \"P x -> False\".\n\n4. Proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume \"P x\" is true (introduce this assumption).\n   - Our goal will be to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis H.\n\n5. Construct the contradiction:\n   - Use the \"exists\" tactic to show that there exists an x for which P x is true.\n   - This directly contradicts the hypothesis H.\n\n6. Complete the proof:\n   - Apply the contradiction to H to finish the proof.\n\n7. Key tactics to use:\n   - intros\n   - unfold not\n   - intro (for assuming P x)\n   - exists\n   - apply\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the logical negation of existential quantifiers.\n   - Correctly manipulating the hypothesis and goal to reach the contradiction.\n\n9. Additional notes:\n   - This proof doesn't require any of the imported libraries, but they might be useful for more complex problems or alternative proof strategies.\n   - The classical logic library (Classical_Prop) could provide an alternative proof path if needed, but a constructive proof is possible and preferable here.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem \"not_exists\", we should follow the first steps of our planning strategy:\n\n1. We need to introduce the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis into our context. This will set up the basic structure of our proof.\n\n2. After introduction, we should unfold the definition of negation in our goal to make it easier to work with.\n\n3. Then, we'll set up for a proof by contradiction by assuming P x is true.\n\n4. With these steps, we'll be in a good position to construct the contradiction that will prove our theorem.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the acting agent to perform the following steps in order:\n\n1. Use the \"intros\" tactic to bring X, P, H, and x into the context.\n2. Use \"unfold not\" to expand the negation in the goal.\n3. Use \"intro\" to assume P x is true.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof structure and prepare us for the key part of the proof where we'll derive the contradiction.\n",
