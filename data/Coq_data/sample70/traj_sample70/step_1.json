    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if there does not exist an x of type X for which P x is true, then for all x of type X, P x is false.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the existential quantifier's definition.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros X P H x\".\n   - This introduces the type X, the predicate P, the hypothesis H (which states that there does not exist an x for which P x is true), and an arbitrary x of type X.\n\n3. Transform the goal:\n   - The goal will be \"~ P x\".\n   - Use \"unfold not\" to expand this into \"P x -> False\".\n\n4. Proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume \"P x\" is true (introduce this assumption).\n   - Our goal will be to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis H.\n\n5. Construct the contradiction:\n   - Use the \"exists\" tactic to show that there exists an x for which P x is true.\n   - This directly contradicts the hypothesis H.\n\n6. Complete the proof:\n   - Apply the contradiction to H to finish the proof.\n\n7. Key tactics to use:\n   - intros\n   - unfold not\n   - intro (for assuming P x)\n   - exists\n   - apply\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the logical negation of existential quantifiers.\n   - Correctly manipulating the hypothesis and goal to reach the contradiction.\n\n9. Additional notes:\n   - This proof doesn't require any of the imported libraries, but they might be useful for more complex problems or alternative proof strategies.\n   - The classical logic library (Classical_Prop) could provide an alternative proof path if needed, but a constructive proof is possible and preferable here.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we've successfully set up the proof and transformed the goal as intended. Now, we need to construct a contradiction to complete the proof. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have introduced the assumption Hx : P x, which states that P x is true for our arbitrary x.\n\n2. Our goal is to derive False, which we can do by contradicting the hypothesis H.\n\n3. The hypothesis H states that there does not exist an x for which P x is true. However, we have an x (the one we introduced) for which P x is true (Hx).\n\n4. We can use this to construct an existential statement that directly contradicts H.\n\n5. The next step should be to use the \"exists\" tactic to show that there exists an x for which P x is true. We can use our current x as the witness for this existential statement.\n\n6. After constructing this existential statement, we can apply it to H to derive the contradiction and complete the proof.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with the following steps:\n1. Use the \"exists\" tactic with x as the argument.\n2. After that, apply the resulting existential statement to H.\n\nThis reasoning follows our initial plan and should lead to the successful completion of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because we tried to use variables (x, H, Hx) that were not introduced in the current context, indicating a misalignment between our reasoning and the actual proof state.\n\nImprovement: We need to start the proof by introducing the universal quantifiers and hypothesis using intros, then proceed with a proof by contradiction using the classic reasoning principle.\n```\n\nBased on the errors we encountered, it's clear that we jumped ahead in our reasoning without properly setting up the proof context. Here's a more detailed reflection:\n\n1. We attempted to use tactics and variables that weren't available in the current proof state. This indicates that we missed crucial steps in setting up the proof.\n\n2. The theorem statement involves universal quantification and an implication, which we need to introduce before we can work with them.\n\n3. We should have started with the 'intros' tactic to bring the quantified variables and hypothesis into our context.\n\n4. The nature of the theorem suggests a proof by contradiction would be appropriate, but we need to set it up correctly.\n\n5. We might need to use classical reasoning principles, given that we've imported Classical_Prop.\n\nFor the next steps, I suggest:\n\n1. Start the proof with 'intros' to bring X, P, and the hypothesis into context.\n2. Use 'intro' again to assume the negation of our goal for a proof by contradiction.\n3. Apply classical reasoning to transform the goal into a form we can work with.\n4. Then proceed with the existential reasoning we originally planned.\n\nThis approach should align better with the theorem statement and the available context, leading to a more coherent and successful proof strategy.",
