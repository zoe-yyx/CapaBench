    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if there does not exist an x of type X for which P x is true, then for all x of type X, P x is false.\n   - This is essentially the contrapositive of the existential quantifier's definition.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros X P H x\".\n   - This introduces the type X, the predicate P, the hypothesis H (which states that there does not exist an x for which P x is true), and an arbitrary x of type X.\n\n3. Transform the goal:\n   - The goal will be \"~ P x\".\n   - Use \"unfold not\" to expand this into \"P x -> False\".\n\n4. Proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume \"P x\" is true (introduce this assumption).\n   - Our goal will be to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis H.\n\n5. Construct the contradiction:\n   - Use the \"exists\" tactic to show that there exists an x for which P x is true.\n   - This directly contradicts the hypothesis H.\n\n6. Complete the proof:\n   - Apply the contradiction to H to finish the proof.\n\n7. Key tactics to use:\n   - intros\n   - unfold not\n   - intro (for assuming P x)\n   - exists\n   - apply\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the logical negation of existential quantifiers.\n   - Correctly manipulating the hypothesis and goal to reach the contradiction.\n\n9. Additional notes:\n   - This proof doesn't require any of the imported libraries, but they might be useful for more complex problems or alternative proof strategies.\n   - The classical logic library (Classical_Prop) could provide an alternative proof path if needed, but a constructive proof is possible and preferable here.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start by introducing the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis. This will set up our proof context correctly.\n\n2. After introduction, we should unfold the negation in the goal to make it easier to work with.\n\n3. We'll then use a proof by contradiction strategy, assuming the negation of our goal.\n\n4. To handle the negation of the universal quantifier, we'll need to use classical reasoning principles.\n\n5. Once we have the correct assumptions in our context, we can proceed with the existential reasoning to derive a contradiction.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Use 'intros X P H x' to introduce all variables and the hypothesis.\n2. Use 'unfold not in *' to expand all negations in the goal and hypothesis.\n3. Use 'apply NNPP' (from Classical_Prop) to set up the proof by contradiction.\n4. Introduce the assumption with 'intro HP'.\n5. Now we can use 'apply H' to get a contradiction.\n6. Use 'exists x' to provide the witness for the existential.\n7. The goal should now match our assumption HP, which we can use to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach addresses the previous errors and aligns with the theorem's structure and available tactics.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current outcome, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was correct, but the final step (exact HP) was incorrect as HP has the wrong type for the goal.\nImprovement: Instead of using 'exact HP', we should use classical reasoning to derive a contradiction from HP and the goal (P x -> False).\n```\n\nLet's break down the reflection:\n\n1. The overall proof strategy was sound, using proof by contradiction and classical logic. Most steps were correct up until the last one.\n\n2. The error occurred in the final step when trying to prove 'P x'. We tried to use HP directly, but HP has type '~ (P x -> False)', which doesn't match our goal 'P x'.\n\n3. To improve, we need to leverage the contradiction between HP: '~ (P x -> False)' and our implicit ability to prove 'P x -> False' (which is what we're trying to negate with NNPP).\n\n4. A better approach would be to:\n   - Introduce a new hypothesis assuming 'P x -> False'\n   - Use this to derive a contradiction with HP\n   - This will complete the proof by showing that assuming '~ (P x -> False)' leads to a contradiction\n\n5. Specifically, we could replace the last step with:\n   - intro HPF.  (* Assume P x -> False *)\n   - apply HP.   (* This should produce False, completing the proof *)\n   - exact HPF.\n\nThis adjustment should complete the proof correctly by leveraging the contradiction inherent in our assumptions and goal.",
