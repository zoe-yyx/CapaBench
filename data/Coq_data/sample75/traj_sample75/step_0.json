Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named 'logic_ex7'.\n   - It involves universal quantification over a type A and two predicates P and Q on A.\n   - It also involves a specific element a0 of type A.\n   - The goal is to prove that if certain conditions hold, then P a0 is false.\n\n2. Break down the hypothesis:\n   - First hypothesis: For all a of type A, if P a and Q a are true, then we can derive False.\n   - Second hypothesis: Q a0 is true.\n   - Goal: Prove that P a0 is false (i.e., ~ P a0).\n\n3. Strategy for proof:\n   a. Start with 'intros' to bring all variables and hypotheses into the context.\n   b. Use 'unfold not' to expand the definition of negation in the goal.\n   c. Apply the principle of contradiction:\n      - Assume P a0 is true.\n      - Use the first hypothesis with a = a0 to derive False.\n      - This will prove ~ P a0.\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - intros A P Q a0 H1 H2.\n   - unfold not.\n   - intros H3.\n   - apply H1 with (a := a0).\n   - exact H3.\n   - exact H2.\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step in the proof is valid.\n   - Check that all hypotheses are used.\n   - Confirm that the final goal is reached.\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Understanding the role of universal quantification in the first hypothesis.\n   - Correctly applying the principle of contradiction.\n   - Properly using the hypotheses to derive the contradiction.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem logic_ex7, our first step should be to introduce all the variables and hypotheses into the context. This aligns with step 3a of our planning strategy.\n\nThe theorem statement involves universal quantification over a type A, two predicates P and Q, a specific element a0, and two hypotheses. We need to bring all of these into our proof context so we can work with them.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the 'intros' tactic. This will allow us to name and work with each component of the theorem statement individually.\n\nAfter introducing these elements, we'll be in a position to start working on the actual proof logic, beginning with expanding the definition of negation as outlined in step 3b of our plan.\n\nSo, the acting agent should be instructed to use the 'intros' tactic, introducing all variables and hypotheses mentioned in the theorem statement.\n",
