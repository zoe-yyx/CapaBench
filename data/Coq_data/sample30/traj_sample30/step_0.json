Analyze the tree_height function:\n   - For a Leaf node, the function directly returns 0.\n   - For Node, it calculates max height of left and right subtrees and adds 1.\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start the proof by stating the theorem.\n   b. Use the definition of tree_height function.\n   c. Since we're dealing with a Leaf node, we can directly unfold the function.\n   d. The result should immediately simplify to 0.\n   e. Use reflexivity to complete the proof.\n\n4. Possible tactics to use:\n   - Proof.\n   - unfold tree_height.\n   - simpl.\n   - reflexivity.\n   - Qed.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - This proof should be straightforward and not require any complex tactics.\n   - No need to use induction or case analysis as we're only dealing with the Leaf case.\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nThe proof for the Leaf_height theorem should be straightforward and can be completed in a few simple steps. Here's the reasoning for the next actions:\n\n1. We should begin by starting the proof formally. This is typically done using the \"Proof.\" command in Coq.\n\n2. The tree_height function is already defined for us, and we're specifically looking at the case of a Leaf node. The function directly returns 0 for a Leaf, so we don't need to do any complex unfolding or induction.\n\n3. We can use the \"simpl\" tactic to simplify the left-hand side of the equation. This should automatically reduce \"tree_height Leaf\" to 0.\n\n4. After simplification, we should have a trivial equality (0 = 0). This can be proved using the \"reflexivity\" tactic, which checks if both sides of an equation are identical.\n\n5. Finally, we should end the proof with \"Qed.\" to indicate that we've completed our proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should proceed with starting the proof and applying these tactics in sequence. This approach directly follows our planning strategy and should lead to a successful and concise proof of the Leaf_height theorem.\n",
