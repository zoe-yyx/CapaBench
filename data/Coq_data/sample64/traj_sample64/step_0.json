Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a universal quantification over two integers n and m.\n   - The goal is to prove a disjunction (OR) of two statements.\n\n2. Identify the key components:\n   - Left side of the disjunction: n < m\n   - Right side of the disjunction: ~ (n < m)\n\n3. Recognize the logical principle:\n   - This theorem is an instance of the law of excluded middle.\n   - In classical logic, for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation is true.\n\n4. Plan the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with intros to bring n and m into the context.\n   b. Apply the law of excluded middle (classic principle) to the proposition \"n < m\".\n   c. Use destruct to split the proof into two cases:\n      - Case 1: n < m is true\n      - Case 2: n < m is false\n   d. For each case, prove the corresponding side of the disjunction.\n\n5. Utilize available tactics:\n   - intros: to introduce variables into the context\n   - apply: to apply the classical reasoning principle\n   - destruct: to split the proof into cases\n   - left and right: to prove the appropriate side of the disjunction\n   - assumption: to use hypotheses directly when they match the goal\n\n6. Consider potential challenges:\n   - Ensure that the classical reasoning principle is available (it should be due to the import of Classical_Prop).\n   - Be prepared to handle any type conversion between Z and Prop if necessary.\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nThe theorem not_ex1 states that for any two integers n and m, either n < m or it's not the case that n < m. This is a classic example of the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation is true.\n\nTo prove this theorem, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduce the variables n and m into the context using the 'intros' tactic.\n\n2. Apply the law of excluded middle to the proposition \"n < m\". We can do this using the 'apply' tactic with the 'classic' principle, which should be available due to the import of Classical_Prop.\n\n3. After applying the classic principle, we'll have two cases to consider:\n   - Case where n < m is true\n   - Case where n < m is false (i.e., ~ (n < m) is true)\n\n4. We can use the 'destruct' tactic to split our proof into these two cases.\n\n5. For the first case, where n < m is true, we can use the 'left' tactic to prove the left side of the disjunction, and then use the 'assumption' tactic to finish this branch of the proof.\n\n6. For the second case, where ~ (n < m) is true, we can use the 'right' tactic to prove the right side of the disjunction, and then use the 'assumption' tactic to finish this branch of the proof.\n\nThis approach directly follows our planning strategy and makes use of classical logic to prove the theorem in a straightforward manner.\n",
