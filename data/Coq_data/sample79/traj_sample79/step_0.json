Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem and_assoc2 involves logical conjunction (AND) and its associativity\n   - It states that ((P /\\ Q) /\\ R) implies (P /\\ (Q /\\ R)) for any propositions P, Q, and R\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with an intros statement to bring the hypotheses into the context\n   b. Decompose the left-hand side of the implication ((P /\\ Q) /\\ R)\n   c. Construct the right-hand side (P /\\ (Q /\\ R)) using the decomposed parts\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Use 'intros P Q R H' to introduce the propositions and the hypothesis\n   b. Use 'destruct H as [[HP HQ] HR]' to break down the left-hand side conjunction\n   c. Use 'split' to prove the two parts of the right-hand side conjunction:\n      - For the first part (P), use HP directly\n      - For the second part (Q /\\ R), use 'split' again and prove Q and R separately\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - All goals should be solved after these steps\n   - Use 'Qed' to complete the proof\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward and not require any advanced tactics\n   - No need to use the imported libraries for this specific theorem\n   - The associativity of conjunction is a fundamental logical property, so the proof should be relatively simple\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by implementing the first steps of our planned strategy. The theorem and_assoc2 involves logical conjunction and its associativity, stating that ((P /\\ Q) /\\ R) implies (P /\\ (Q /\\ R)) for any propositions P, Q, and R.\n\nOur first step should be to introduce the propositions and the hypothesis into the context. This will allow us to work with the specific instances of P, Q, R, and the assumption ((P /\\ Q) /\\ R).\n\nAfter introducing these elements, we should focus on breaking down the left-hand side of the implication ((P /\\ Q) /\\ R) into its constituent parts. This decomposition will give us the individual propositions that we need to construct the right-hand side of the implication.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent starts with the following steps:\n\n1. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring P, Q, R, and the hypothesis into the context.\n2. Use the 'destruct' tactic to break down the conjunction ((P /\\ Q) /\\ R) into its individual components.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof environment and provide us with the necessary pieces to construct the right-hand side of the implication in the subsequent steps.\n",
