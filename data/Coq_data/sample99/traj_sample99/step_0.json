Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the commutativity of addition (add_comm theorem).\n   - We have definitions for natural numbers (nat) and addition (add).\n   - Two lemmas are provided: add_0_r and add_succ_r.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use induction on one of the variables (n or m).\n   - Induction on n seems more straightforward given the definition of add.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with induction on n.\n   b. Base case: Prove add O m = add m O\n   c. Inductive case: Prove add (S n) m = add m (S n)\n\n4. For the base case:\n   - Simplify add O m using the definition of add.\n   - Use the add_0_r lemma to simplify add m O.\n\n5. For the inductive case:\n   - Use the induction hypothesis: add n m = add m n\n   - Simplify add (S n) m using the definition of add.\n   - Use the add_succ_r lemma to rewrite add m (S n).\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis.\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered.\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n7. Additional considerations:\n   - Be prepared to use rewrite tactics with the provided lemmas.\n   - Consider using the reflexivity tactic for equality proofs.\n   - Use simpl tactic to simplify expressions when needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the add_comm theorem, we should follow the planned structure:\n\n1. Start with induction on n:\n   - This will set up our proof structure with a base case and an inductive case.\n   - Induction on n is chosen because the add function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n2. For the base case (n = O):\n   - We need to prove: add O m = add m O\n   - The left side (add O m) can be simplified using the definition of add.\n   - The right side (add m O) can be rewritten using the add_0_r lemma.\n\n3. For the inductive case:\n   - We'll have an induction hypothesis: add n m = add m n\n   - We need to prove: add (S n) m = add m (S n)\n   - The left side can be simplified using the definition of add.\n   - The right side can be rewritten using the add_succ_r lemma.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n. This will set up the proof structure and allow us to tackle each case separately.\n",
