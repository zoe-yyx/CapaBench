Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence between two propositions involving universal quantification and conjunction.\n   - Left side: ∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a)\n   - Right side: (∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a))\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff (<->) nature of the theorem to split the proof into two directions.\n   - Prove the forward direction: (∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a)) -> ((∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a)))\n   - Prove the backward direction: ((∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a))) -> (∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a))\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for the left side.\n   - Split the right side into two parts.\n   - For each part, introduce a universal quantifier and use the hypothesis to prove P(a) and Q(a) separately.\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for the right side.\n   - Introduce a universal quantifier for an arbitrary 'a'.\n   - Split the hypothesis into two parts: (∀a, P(a)) and (∀a, Q(a)).\n   - Use these to prove P(a) ∧ Q(a) for the arbitrary 'a'.\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce hypotheses and variables\n   - split: to handle conjunctions\n   - apply: to use hypotheses\n   - auto: for simple logical steps\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Managing multiple quantifiers and hypotheses\n   - Ensuring that the proof is general for any type A and predicates P and Q\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are solved and there are no remaining obligations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof, our first step should be to set up the basic structure of the proof as outlined in the planning strategy. We should begin by introducing the universal quantifiers and the propositions, then split the proof into the two directions of the bi-implication.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should start by introducing the type A and the predicates P and Q. This sets up the context for our proof.\n\n2. Next, we should use the 'iff' nature of the theorem to split the proof into two directions. This aligns with step 2 of our planning strategy.\n\n3. For the forward direction, we should introduce a hypothesis representing the left side of the bi-implication. This prepares us to prove the right side using this hypothesis.\n\n4. For the backward direction, we should introduce hypotheses representing the right side of the bi-implication. This sets us up to prove the left side using these hypotheses.\n\nBy following these steps, we'll have a solid foundation for the rest of the proof, aligning with our overall strategy. The acting agent should focus on implementing these initial structural steps before diving into the details of each direction of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure was correct, but the execution of steps was incomplete and contained errors in bullet usage and variable naming.\n\nImprovement: Complete each subgoal methodically, use bullets consistently, and be mindful of variable names to avoid conflicts and ensure a smooth proof progression.\n```\n\nReflecting on the current state of the proof:\n\n1. The initial structure of the proof was set up correctly, splitting the bi-implication and introducing the necessary hypotheses.\n\n2. However, the execution of the proof steps was incomplete. The first subgoal (proving P a) was not finished, and there were attempts to move on to the next parts without completing the current goal.\n\n3. There were issues with bullet usage. The + bullet was used correctly for the first subgoal, but then there was an attempt to use it again without finishing the first part.\n\n4. There was an attempt to introduce variables that were already in context, leading to errors.\n\nTo improve the proof process:\n\n1. Focus on completing each subgoal before moving to the next. For the current goal (P a), we need to use the hypothesis H to extract the P a part of the conjunction.\n\n2. Use bullets consistently. After completing the P a subgoal, use - for the Q a subgoal to maintain the proper structure.\n\n3. Be mindful of variable names and what's already in context. Avoid reintroducing variables that are already present.\n\n4. For the backward direction of the proof, introduce the hypotheses correctly and then focus on proving the conjunction for any given a.\n\nBy addressing these points, the proof should progress more smoothly and logically. The acting agent should focus on completing the current subgoal (proving P a) using the available hypothesis before moving on to the next steps.",
