    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence between two propositions involving universal quantification and conjunction.\n   - Left side: ∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a)\n   - Right side: (∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a))\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff (<->) nature of the theorem to split the proof into two directions.\n   - Prove the forward direction: (∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a)) -> ((∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a)))\n   - Prove the backward direction: ((∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a))) -> (∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a))\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for the left side.\n   - Split the right side into two parts.\n   - For each part, introduce a universal quantifier and use the hypothesis to prove P(a) and Q(a) separately.\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for the right side.\n   - Introduce a universal quantifier for an arbitrary 'a'.\n   - Split the hypothesis into two parts: (∀a, P(a)) and (∀a, Q(a)).\n   - Use these to prove P(a) ∧ Q(a) for the arbitrary 'a'.\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce hypotheses and variables\n   - split: to handle conjunctions\n   - apply: to use hypotheses\n   - auto: for simple logical steps\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Managing multiple quantifiers and hypotheses\n   - Ensuring that the proof is general for any type A and predicates P and Q\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are solved and there are no remaining obligations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We are currently in the forward direction of the proof, trying to show that (forall a : A, P a /\\ Q a) implies (forall a : A, P a) /\\ (forall a : A, Q a).\n\n2. We have introduced the hypothesis H : forall a : A, P a /\\ Q a, and split the goal into two subgoals.\n\n3. We are now focusing on the first subgoal: forall a : A, P a. We've introduced an arbitrary a : A, and our current goal is to prove P a.\n\n4. To prove P a, we need to use our hypothesis H. Since H gives us P a /\\ Q a for any a, we can apply it to our current a and then extract the P a part.\n\n5. After proving P a, we'll need to prove Q a in a similar manner for the second part of the split goal.\n\n6. Once both parts are proven, we'll move to the backward direction of the proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should:\n1. Apply the hypothesis H to the current a.\n2. Extract the P a part from the resulting conjunction.\n3. Use this to solve the current goal.\n4. Then move on to proving Q a in a similar manner.\n5. After that, proceed to the backward direction of the proof.\n\nThis approach will methodically complete the forward direction of the proof before moving on to the backward direction.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The command 'apply H' was used without first introducing the hypothesis H, leading to an error.\nImprovement: Begin the proof by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses using 'intros' before attempting to apply any hypotheses.\n```\n\nThe current attempt to apply hypothesis H directly failed because we haven't properly set up the proof environment yet. This reflects a misunderstanding of the proof's current state and the proper sequencing of proof steps.\n\nTo improve our approach:\n\n1. We should start by introducing the universal quantifiers and the left side of the bi-implication. This will give us the hypothesis we need to work with.\n\n2. After introducing the necessary elements, we should split the bi-implication into two implications to prove separately.\n\n3. For the forward direction, we should then split the right-hand side conjunction into two goals.\n\n4. Only then should we try to apply our hypothesis to prove each part of the conjunction.\n\nThe acting agent should start with these steps:\n\n1. Use 'intros A P Q H' to introduce the variables and the hypothesis.\n2. Use 'split' to separate the bi-implication into two implications.\n3. For the forward direction, use 'split' again to separate the conjunction.\n4. Then proceed with applying the hypothesis H to prove each part.\n\nThis structured approach will set up the proof correctly and allow us to make progress without encountering errors due to undefined hypotheses.",
