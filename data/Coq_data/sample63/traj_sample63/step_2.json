Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states an equivalence between two propositions involving universal quantification and conjunction.\n   - Left side: ∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a)\n   - Right side: (∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a))\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff (<->) nature of the theorem to split the proof into two directions.\n   - Prove the forward direction: (∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a)) -> ((∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a)))\n   - Prove the backward direction: ((∀a, P(a)) ∧ (∀a, Q(a))) -> (∀a, P(a) ∧ Q(a))\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for the left side.\n   - Split the right side into two parts.\n   - For each part, introduce a universal quantifier and use the hypothesis to prove P(a) and Q(a) separately.\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for the right side.\n   - Introduce a universal quantifier for an arbitrary 'a'.\n   - Split the hypothesis into two parts: (∀a, P(a)) and (∀a, Q(a)).\n   - Use these to prove P(a) ∧ Q(a) for the arbitrary 'a'.\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce hypotheses and variables\n   - split: to handle conjunctions\n   - apply: to use hypotheses\n   - auto: for simple logical steps\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Managing multiple quantifiers and hypotheses\n   - Ensuring that the proof is general for any type A and predicates P and Q\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are solved and there are no remaining obligations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next steps:\n\n1. We need to start by introducing the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis for the left side of the bi-implication. This will set up our proof environment correctly.\n\n2. After introducing these elements, we should split the bi-implication into two directions to prove separately.\n\n3. For the forward direction (left to right), we need to prove that the conjunction on the right side holds. This can be done by splitting it into two separate goals.\n\n4. Once we have these separate goals, we can use the introduced hypothesis to prove each part.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Use 'intros A P Q H' to introduce the type A, predicates P and Q, and the hypothesis H for the left side of the bi-implication.\n2. Use 'split' to separate the bi-implication into two implications (forward and backward directions).\n3. For the forward direction, use 'split' again to separate the conjunction on the right side into two goals.\n4. Then, for each of these goals, apply the hypothesis H and use appropriate tactics to extract the needed part of the conjunction.\n\nThis structured approach will set up the proof correctly and allow us to make progress without encountering errors due to undefined hypotheses.\n",
