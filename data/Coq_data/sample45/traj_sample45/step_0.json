Understand the definitions and problem statement:\n   - Review the definitions of 'convex' and 'mono' functions.\n   - Analyze the theorem 'logic_ex1' and its structure.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'intros T H1 H2 f H3'.\n   - This introduces the transformation T, the two hypotheses about T preserving monotonicity and convexity, and a function f that is both monotonic and convex.\n\n3. Break down the goal:\n   - The goal will be to prove 'mono (T f) /\\ convex (T f)'.\n   - Use 'split' tactic to separate this into two subgoals.\n\n4. Prove monotonicity of T f:\n   - Apply the first hypothesis H1 to prove 'mono (T f)'.\n   - Use the 'mono f' part of H3.\n\n5. Prove convexity of T f:\n   - Apply the second hypothesis H2 to prove 'convex (T f)'.\n   - Use the 'convex f' part of H3.\n\n6. Handle any remaining subgoals:\n   - If there are any remaining subgoals, they will likely involve showing that f is indeed monotonic and convex.\n   - Use the parts of H3 directly to prove these.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Once all subgoals are solved, the proof should be complete.\n   - Use 'Qed' to finish the proof.\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - This proof relies heavily on the given hypotheses and doesn't require complex manipulations.\n   - The key is to correctly apply the hypotheses about T preserving monotonicity and convexity.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof has not yet been started, so we should begin by following the first steps of our plan. We need to set up the proof by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses. \n\nOur first step should be to use the 'intros' tactic to bring all the quantified variables and hypotheses into our context. This will allow us to work with them directly in our proof.\n\nAfter introducing these elements, we should split our goal into two subgoals using the 'split' tactic. This is because our goal is a conjunction (mono (T f) /\\ convex (T f)), and it's often easier to prove each part separately.\n\nOnce we've split the goal, we can focus on proving each part individually. For the first part (mono (T f)), we can use our hypothesis H1 which states that T preserves monotonicity. Similarly, for the second part (convex (T f)), we can use H2 which states that T preserves convexity.\n\nIn both cases, we'll need to use the fact that f is both monotonic and convex, which is given by hypothesis H3.\n\nSo, the next steps for the acting agent should be:\n\n1. Use 'intros' to bring all variables and hypotheses into the context.\n2. Use 'split' to separate the goal into two subgoals.\n3. Focus on proving 'mono (T f)' using H1 and the monotonicity of f from H3.\n",
