Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that multiplication distributes over addition on the right.\n   - We need to prove: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p) for all natural numbers n, m, and p.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"Proof.\"\n   - Use induction on n, as the mul function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n3. Base case (n = O):\n   - Simplify the left side: mul (add O m) p\n   - Simplify the right side: add (mul O p) (mul m p)\n   - Show that these are equal\n\n4. Inductive case (n = S n'):\n   - Assume the theorem holds for n', we need to prove it for S n'\n   - Expand the left side: mul (add (S n') m) p\n   - Expand the right side: add (mul (S n') p) (mul m p)\n   - Use the definitions of add and mul to simplify both sides\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis\n\n5. Use auxiliary theorems and properties:\n   - Utilize the add_assoc theorem (already admitted) when needed\n   - Apply the properties of addition and multiplication as necessary\n\n6. Complete the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Use \"Qed.\" to finish the proof\n\n7. Additional strategies:\n   - If stuck, consider using the \"simpl\" tactic to simplify expressions\n   - Use the \"rewrite\" tactic with add_assoc or other relevant properties\n   - Apply the \"reflexivity\" tactic when both sides of the equation are identical\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem mul_add_distr_r, we should start by following the plan outlined in steps 1 and 2. \n\n1. We understand that the theorem states the distributive property of multiplication over addition on the right side for natural numbers.\n\n2. To set up the proof, we should begin with the following steps:\n\n   a) Start the proof with \"Proof.\"\n   b) Introduce the variables n, m, and p using \"intros n m p.\"\n   c) Since the mul function is defined recursively on its first argument (n in this case), we should use induction on n.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to begin the proof and set up the induction on n. This will allow us to tackle both the base case and the inductive case as outlined in steps 3 and 4 of our plan.\n\nThe acting agent should be instructed to start the proof, introduce the variables, and initiate the induction on n.\n",
