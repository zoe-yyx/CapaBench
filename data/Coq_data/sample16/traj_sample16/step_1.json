    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_up1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_up1' applies a function and then adds 1 to the result\n\n2. Break down the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for all x, shift_up1 plus_one x = x + 2\n   - This means we need to prove equality between these two expressions\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side of the equation: shift_up1 plus_one x\n   b. Expand the definition of shift_up1\n   c. Then expand the definition of plus_one\n   d. Simplify the resulting expression\n   e. Show that the simplified expression equals x + 2\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Introduce x as a variable\n   - Unfold the definitions of shift_up1 and plus_one\n   - Use basic arithmetic to simplify the expression\n   - Demonstrate that the result is equal to x + 2\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce the variable x\n   - unfold: to expand the definitions\n   - simpl: to simplify expressions\n   - rewrite: if any rewriting of expressions is needed\n   - reflexivity: to prove equality if the expressions are identical\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper unfolding of nested definitions\n   - Handle the Z arithmetic correctly\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are solved\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Coq without any errors\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, but we need to adjust the final step. The current goal is to prove that x + 1 + 1 = x + 2, which is a simple arithmetic equality. While this is obvious to us, Coq's reflexivity tactic is not powerful enough to prove it automatically.\n\nTo solve this, we should use a tactic specifically designed for arithmetic equalities. The ring tactic is ideal for this situation as it can handle equalities in ring-like structures such as integers with addition. Alternatively, the lia (Linear Integer Arithmetic) tactic would also work well here.\n\nThe proof structure so far is correct:\n1. We've introduced the variable x with 'intros x'.\n2. We've unfolded the definitions of shift_up1 and plus_one with 'unfold shift_up1, plus_one'.\n\nNow, instead of using simpl and reflexivity, we should directly apply the ring tactic. This should complete the proof by handling the arithmetic equality x + 1 + 1 = x + 2.\n\nIf for any reason ring doesn't work, lia would be a good alternative to try next.\n",
