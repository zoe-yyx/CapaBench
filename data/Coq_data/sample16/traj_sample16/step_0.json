Break down the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for all x, shift_up1 plus_one x = x + 2\n   - This means we need to prove equality between these two expressions\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side of the equation: shift_up1 plus_one x\n   b. Expand the definition of shift_up1\n   c. Then expand the definition of plus_one\n   d. Simplify the resulting expression\n   e. Show that the simplified expression equals x + 2\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, our first steps should follow the initial parts of our proving strategy. We should start by introducing the variable x and then unfold the definitions of the functions involved. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the variable x:\n   We need to start by introducing x as a variable in our proof context. This will allow us to work with a specific, arbitrary value of x.\n\n2. Unfold the definition of shift_up1:\n   After introducing x, we should expand the definition of shift_up1. This will give us a more concrete expression to work with, replacing the function application with its actual definition.\n\n3. Unfold the definition of plus_one:\n   Once shift_up1 is unfolded, we'll see a reference to plus_one. We should then unfold this definition as well to get to the basic arithmetic operations.\n\n4. Simplify the resulting expression:\n   After unfolding both definitions, we should have an expression that can be simplified using basic integer arithmetic. The simplification should lead us to an expression that is clearly equal to x + 2.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof nicely, allowing us to see the direct relationship between the left-hand side of the equation (shift_up1 plus_one x) and the right-hand side (x + 2). From there, we can proceed to show their equality, likely using reflexivity or basic arithmetic reasoning.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof fails because the left-hand side (x + 1 + 1) is not automatically recognized as equal to the right-hand side (x + 2) by the reflexivity tactic.\n\nImprovement: Instead of using reflexivity, we should use ring or lia tactic to handle the arithmetic equality, as these tactics are better equipped to deal with basic integer arithmetic.\n```\n\nThe current approach was close but didn't quite succeed. The steps of introducing the variable and unfolding the definitions were correct and set up the proof well. However, the final step of using reflexivity was not sufficient to prove the equality.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that Coq's reflexivity tactic is not powerful enough to recognize that x + 1 + 1 is equal to x + 2. While this equality is obvious to us, Coq needs a more specialized tactic to handle such arithmetic equalities.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should replace the reflexivity tactic with a more appropriate one. The ring tactic is designed to handle equalities in ring-like structures (such as integers with addition), and would be perfect for this situation. Alternatively, the lia (Linear Integer Arithmetic) tactic could also solve this goal easily.\n\nFor the next attempt, the acting agent should follow the same steps up to the unfolding of definitions, but then use ring or lia instead of reflexivity. This should successfully complete the proof.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the simpl tactic didn't have any effect in this case. While it's not harmful, it's also not necessary, so it could be omitted in future attempts to streamline the proof.",
