    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving an equality for the `shift_up1_square` example.\n   - We need to show that `shift_up1 square x = x * x + 1` for all x.\n\n2. Understand the definitions:\n   - `square` is defined as `x * x`\n   - `shift_up1` is defined as `f x + 1` where f is a function\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Start with `intros x` to introduce the variable x into the context.\n   b. Unfold the definitions of `shift_up1` and `square`.\n   c. Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equality.\n   d. The goal should then become trivial, as both sides will be identical.\n\n4. Proof strategy:\n   - Use `unfold` tactic to expand the definitions.\n   - Use `simpl` tactic to simplify expressions if needed.\n   - The proof should be straightforward and likely completed with `reflexivity`.\n\n5. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are solved.\n   - Check if any additional simplification or rewriting steps are needed.\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - The proof seems straightforward, but be prepared to handle any unexpected simplification issues.\n   - If the automatic simplification doesn't work as expected, consider using `rewrite` with the definitions explicitly.\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - This proof should be relatively simple and direct, mainly relying on unfolding definitions and basic simplification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof for the `shift_up1_square` theorem, our first steps should focus on setting up the proof environment and expanding the definitions involved. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should start by introducing the universal quantifier variable 'x' into our context. This will allow us to work with a specific, arbitrary value of x throughout the proof.\n\n2. After introducing x, we need to expand the definitions of both `shift_up1` and `square`. This is crucial because the theorem statement uses these functions, and we need to work with their actual definitions to prove the equality.\n\n3. Once the definitions are expanded, we should have an equation that directly compares the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the theorem statement in terms of basic operations on x.\n\n4. At this point, the goal should become a straightforward equality between two identical expressions, which can likely be solved by simple reflexivity.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I recommend the following sequence of actions for the acting agent:\n\n1. Use the `intros` tactic to bring 'x' into the context.\n2. Use the `unfold` tactic to expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `square`.\n3. If needed, use `simpl` to simplify any remaining expressions.\n4. Attempt to solve the resulting goal with `reflexivity`.\n\nThis approach follows our planned strategy and should lead to a concise and direct proof of the theorem.\n",
