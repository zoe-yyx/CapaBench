    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any proposition P, \"P or P\" is logically equivalent to P itself.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Break down the proof into two parts:\n   a. Left to right: (P \\/ P) -> P\n   b. Right to left: P -> (P \\/ P)\n\n3. Proof strategy for (P \\/ P) -> P:\n   - Use destruct to break down the disjunction\n   - Both cases will lead directly to P, so this should be straightforward\n\n4. Proof strategy for P -> (P \\/ P):\n   - This direction is simpler\n   - We can directly construct the disjunction by choosing either the left or right side\n\n5. Proof structure:\n   - Start with \"split\" to handle both directions of the iff\n   - For the first direction, use \"intros\" and then \"destruct\"\n   - For the second direction, use \"intros\" and then \"left\" (or \"right\")\n\n6. Possible tactics to use:\n   - intros\n   - split\n   - destruct\n   - left (or right)\n   - reflexivity (for simple cases)\n\n7. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be relatively short and straightforward\n   - No need for complex tactics or automation\n   - Classical logic is not required for this proof, despite the import\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - This theorem demonstrates a fundamental property of logical disjunction\n   - Understanding this proof can help with more complex logical reasoning in Coq\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem or_dup, we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing the proposition P into the context. This will allow us to work with a generic proposition throughout the proof.\n\n2. Use the 'split' tactic to break down the bi-directional implication (<->) into two separate implications that we need to prove:\n   a. (P \\/ P) -> P\n   b. P -> (P \\/ P)\n\n3. For the first direction (P \\/ P) -> P:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis (P \\/ P)\n   - Use the 'destruct' tactic on this hypothesis. This will create two cases:\n     * Case 1: P is true\n     * Case 2: P is true (again)\n   - In both cases, we directly have P, so this direction should be trivial\n\n4. For the second direction P -> (P \\/ P):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis P\n   - Use the 'left' tactic to prove (P \\/ P) by showing that the left side of the disjunction holds\n   - The goal should be immediately solved because we have P in our context\n\nThis reasoning should guide the acting agent to construct a concise and straightforward proof of the theorem. The proof will demonstrate the logical equivalence between P and (P \\/ P) without requiring any complex tactics or classical logic reasoning.\n",
