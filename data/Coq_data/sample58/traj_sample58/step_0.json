Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named \"iff_imply\"\n   - It states that for any propositions P and Q, if P is equivalent to Q, then P implies Q\n   - The goal is to prove: forall P Q: Prop, (P <-> Q) -> (P -> Q)\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to bring the universal quantifiers and hypothesis into the context\n   - Break down the bi-implication (<->) in the hypothesis\n   - Use the left-to-right direction of the bi-implication to prove the implication\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Start with 'intros P Q H' to introduce P, Q, and the hypothesis (P <-> Q)\n   b. Destruct the bi-implication hypothesis H into two parts:\n      - H1: P -> Q\n      - H2: Q -> P\n   c. Introduce the assumption of P (the left side of the implication we need to prove)\n   d.

Verification:\n   - Ensure that all hypotheses are used appropriately\n   - Check that the final goal matches the theorem statement\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven the theorem iff_imply: forall P Q: Prop, (P <-> Q) -> (P -> Q), we should follow the planned proof structure. Since we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to introduce the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis into the context.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to start by introducing the propositions P and Q, as well as the hypothesis that P is equivalent to Q (P <-> Q).\n2. The 'intros' tactic is the most appropriate for this step, as it will bring these elements into our proof context.\n3. After introducing these elements, we'll be in a better position to work with the bi-implication and prove the implication.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in the proof should be to use the 'intros' tactic to bring P, Q, and the equivalence hypothesis into the context. This will set us up for the subsequent steps of breaking down the bi-implication and proving the implication.\n",
