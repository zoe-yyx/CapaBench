    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem six_is_not_prime, we should follow the structure outlined in the planning strategy. Our first step is to introduce the witness n = 2, which satisfies the conditions of being a factor of 6 and lying between 2 and 6.\n\nThe acting agent should start by using the 'exists' tactic to introduce n = 2. This will set up the proof structure and allow us to work on proving the two parts of the conjunction.\n\nAfter introducing n = 2, the next step will be to split the conjunction into two separate goals using the 'split' tactic. This will allow us to prove each part independently.\n\nFor the first part (2 <= n < 6), we can use another 'split' to separate the two inequalities. Then, we can use the 'lia' tactic to prove these simple inequalities automatically.\n\nFor the second part (exists q, n * q = 6), we should use the 'exists' tactic again to introduce q = 3. After that, we can simplify the equation and use 'reflexivity' to prove that 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nBy following these steps, we will have a clear and structured proof that demonstrates 6 is not prime by showing that 2 is a factor of 6 and satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe acting agent should begin with the 'exists 2' tactic to start the proof.\n",
