    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving logic_ex5:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem is a logical statement involving universal quantification and implication.\n   - It states that if P implies Q for all a, and P holds for all a, then Q holds for all a.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin with \"Proof.\"\n   - Introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses:\n     * Let A be an arbitrary type\n     * Let P and Q be arbitrary predicates on A\n     * Assume the two hypotheses:\n       (H1) For all a of type A, P a implies Q a\n       (H2) For all a of type A, P a holds\n\n3. Prove the conclusion:\n   - Goal: Show that for all a of type A, Q a holds\n   - Strategy: Use universal introduction and modus ponens\n   \n   Steps:\n   a) Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   b) Apply the first hypothesis (H1) to 'a'\n   c) Apply the second hypothesis (H2) to 'a'\n   d) Use modus ponens to conclude Q a\n\n4.

Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward and not require any advanced tactics\n   - No need to unfold definitions or use induction\n   - The imported libraries (ZArith, Psatz, Setoid, Classical_Prop) are not directly used in this proof\n\nThis plan provides a clear strategy for proving the theorem logic_ex5 using basic logical reasoning and Coq tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we have successfully introduced all the necessary variables and hypotheses. Now we need to focus on proving the conclusion Q a for the arbitrary element 'a' we introduced.\n\nThe current goal is to prove Q a, and we have two key hypotheses that we can use:\n\n1. H1: forall a : A, P a -> Q a\n2. H2: forall a : A, P a\n\nTo prove Q a, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Apply H1 to our specific 'a'. This will give us P a -> Q a for our particular 'a'.\n2. Apply H2 to our specific 'a'. This will give us P a for our particular 'a'.\n3. Use these two facts to conclude Q a through modus ponens.\n\nThe acting agent should be guided to apply H1 and H2 to the specific 'a', and then use the resulting facts to prove Q a. This can be done using the 'apply' tactic or by explicitly specifying the arguments.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempted to use hypotheses H1 and H2 that were not introduced, resulting in errors.\n\nImprovement: Start the proof by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses using 'intros' before applying any tactics to use these hypotheses.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the current approach was flawed because it tried to use hypotheses (H1 and H2) that were not yet introduced in the proof context. This led to errors when trying to apply these non-existent hypotheses.\n\nTo improve the proving process, we need to start by properly introducing all the variables and hypotheses. The 'intros' tactic should be used at the beginning of the proof to bring the universal quantifiers and implications from the goal into the context as hypotheses.\n\nHere's a more detailed plan for improvement:\n\n1. Begin the proof with 'Proof.' to enter proof mode.\n2. Use 'intros' to introduce all variables and hypotheses. This might look like 'intros A P Q H1 H2 a'.\n3. After introducing the hypotheses, we can then proceed with the planned strategy of applying H1 and H2 to prove Q a.\n4. Be careful to refer to the correct names of the introduced hypotheses.\n5. After applying the hypotheses, we may need to use additional tactics like 'apply' or 'exact' to complete the proof.\n6. End the proof with 'Qed.' only when the proof is complete.\n\nBy following this improved approach, we should be able to construct a valid proof for the theorem without encountering errors related to undefined hypotheses.",
