Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem is a logical statement involving universal quantification and implication.\n   - It states that if P implies Q for all a, and P holds for all a, then Q holds for all a.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin with \"Proof.\"\n   - Introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses:\n     * Let A be an arbitrary type\n     * Let P and Q be arbitrary predicates on A\n     * Assume the two hypotheses:\n       (H1) For all a of type A, P a implies Q a\n       (H2) For all a of type A, P a holds\n\n3. Prove the conclusion:\n   - Goal: Show that for all a of type A, Q a holds\n   - Strategy: Use universal introduction and modus ponens\n   \n   Steps:\n   a) Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   b) Apply the first hypothesis (H1) to 'a'\n   c) Apply the second hypothesis (H2) to 'a'\n   d) Use modus ponens to conclude Q a\n\n4. Finish the proof:\n   - Use \"Qed.\" to complete the proof\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward and not require any advanced tactics\n   - No need to unfold definitions or use induction\n   - The imported libraries (ZArith, Psatz, Setoid, Classical_Prop) are not directly used in this proof\n\nThis plan provides a clear strategy for proving the theorem logic_ex5 using basic logical reasoning and Coq tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem logic_ex5, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin the proof with 'Proof.'\n\n2. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring all the quantified variables and hypotheses into the context. The theorem has a universal quantifier for A, two function variables P and Q, and two hypotheses. We also need to introduce a variable for the final universal quantifier in the conclusion. So, we should use:\n\n   intros A P Q H1 H2 a\n\n   This will introduce:\n   - A as the type\n   - P and Q as predicates on A\n   - H1 as the hypothesis (forall a : A, P a -> Q a)\n   - H2 as the hypothesis (forall a : A, P a)\n   - a as an arbitrary element of type A\n\n3. Now that we have properly introduced all variables and hypotheses, we can proceed with the proof strategy. Our goal is to prove Q a for the arbitrary 'a' we introduced.\n\n4. Apply the first hypothesis H1 to our goal. This will change our goal from (Q a) to (P a), because H1 states that P a implies Q a for all a. Use:\n\n   apply H1\n\n5. Now our goal is to prove (P a). We can use the second hypothesis H2 for this, as it states that P holds for all a. Apply H2:\n\n   apply H2\n\n6. At this point, the proof should be complete. We can end it with:\n\n   Qed.\n\nThis reasoning provides a step-by-step guide to construct a valid proof for the theorem, addressing the previous issues and following the correct logical structure of the statement.\n",
