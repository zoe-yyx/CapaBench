Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem is a logical statement involving universal quantification and implication.\n   - It states that if P implies Q for all a, and P holds for all a, then Q holds for all a.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin with \"Proof.\"\n   - Introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses:\n     * Let A be an arbitrary type\n     * Let P and Q be arbitrary predicates on A\n     * Assume the two hypotheses:\n       (H1) For all a of type A, P a implies Q a\n       (H2) For all a of type A, P a holds\n\n3. Prove the conclusion:\n   - Goal: Show that for all a of type A, Q a holds\n   - Strategy: Use universal introduction and modus ponens\n   \n   Steps:\n   a) Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   b) Apply the first hypothesis (H1) to 'a'\n   c) Apply the second hypothesis (H2) to 'a'\n   d) Use modus ponens to conclude Q a\n\n4. Finish the proof:\n   - Use \"Qed.\" to complete the proof\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward and not require any advanced tactics\n   - No need to unfold definitions or use induction\n   - The imported libraries (ZArith, Psatz, Setoid, Classical_Prop) are not directly used in this proof\n\nThis plan provides a clear strategy for proving the theorem logic_ex5 using basic logical reasoning and Coq tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for logic_ex5, we should follow the plan to set up the proof structure and introduce the necessary variables and hypotheses. The reasoning for the next steps is as follows:\n\n1. Begin the proof with the \"Proof.\" keyword to start the formal proof process in Coq.\n\n2. Introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses:\n   - Use \"intros\" to bring the type A, predicates P and Q, and the two hypotheses into the context.\n   - This will allow us to work with these elements in the subsequent steps of the proof.\n\n3. Prepare to prove the conclusion by introducing a universal quantifier for 'a':\n   - Use \"intros\" again to bring an arbitrary 'a' of type A into the context.\n\n4. At this point, we will have set up the proof environment with all necessary elements to proceed with the logical reasoning.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on these introductory steps to establish the foundation for the proof. Once these steps are completed, we can proceed with applying the hypotheses and using modus ponens to reach the conclusion.\n",
