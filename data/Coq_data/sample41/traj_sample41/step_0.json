Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that reversing a tree doesn't change its size.\n   - The theorem states: forall t, tree_size (tree_reverse t) = tree_size t\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on the tree 't'.\n   - Base case: Leaf\n   - Inductive case: Node l v r\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   a. Start with 'intros t' to introduce the tree variable.\n   b. Use 'induction t' to set up structural induction.\n   c. For the Leaf case:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definitions.\n      - Show that they are equal (should be trivial).\n   d. For the Node case:\n      - We have induction hypotheses for left and right subtrees.\n      - Expand the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n      - Use the induction hypotheses to rewrite the sizes of reversed subtrees.\n      - Prove that the resulting expressions are equal.\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the proof outline as described in the planning strategy. The first step is to introduce the tree variable and set up the structural induction.\n\nReasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the tree variable 't' into the context. This will allow us to work with a specific, but arbitrary, tree throughout the proof.\n\n2. Apply structural induction on 't'. This is crucial because the tree data structure is defined inductively, and we need to prove the property for all possible trees. Induction will give us two cases to prove: the base case (Leaf) and the inductive case (Node).\n\n3. For the Leaf case, which will be our first subgoal:\n   - We should simplify both sides of the equation using the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size for a Leaf.\n   - This simplification should make the equality trivial to prove, as both sides will reduce to 0.\n\n4. For the Node case, which will be our second subgoal:\n   - We'll have induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees.\n   - We should expand the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size for a Node.\n   - Then, we'll need to use the induction hypotheses to rewrite the sizes of the reversed subtrees.\n   - Finally, we'll need to prove that the resulting expressions are equal, which may involve some arithmetic manipulation.\n\nThese steps will set up the structure of our proof and allow us to tackle each case systematically. The acting agent should focus on implementing these initial steps to establish the proof framework.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails because the final equality in the Node case requires arithmetic manipulation that wasn't performed.\n\nImprovement: We should use ring or lia tactic to handle the arithmetic equality, or manually rewrite the expression to show commutativity of addition before applying reflexivity.\n```\n\nThe proof was progressing well until the final step of the Node case. The issue arose because after applying the induction hypotheses, we were left with an equality that is true but not syntactically identical. The left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation differ in the order of addition, which prevents the reflexivity tactic from succeeding.\n\nTo improve the proof, we have a few options:\n\n1. Use the ring tactic: This tactic is designed to solve equalities in commutative rings, which includes integer addition. It would automatically handle the commutativity of addition for us.\n\n2. Use the lia tactic: This tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) can solve linear inequalities and equalities over integers, which includes our case.\n\n3. Manually rewrite the expression: We could use the commutativity of addition to rewrite one side of the equation to match the other before applying reflexivity.\n\nFor the next attempt, the acting agent should replace the final reflexivity tactic with one of these approaches. For example:\n\n- Replace \"reflexivity.\" with \"ring.\" to use the ring tactic.\n- Or replace \"reflexivity.\" with \"lia.\" to use the lia tactic.\n- Or manually rewrite the expression using lemmas about commutativity and associativity of addition before applying reflexivity.\n\nThis adjustment should complete the proof successfully. The reasoning agent should consider these options and choose the most appropriate one based on the available tactics and the desired level of explicitness in the proof.",
