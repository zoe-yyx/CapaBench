Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that reversing a tree doesn't change its size.\n   - The theorem states: forall t, tree_size (tree_reverse t) = tree_size t\n\n2. Proof Strategy:\n   - Use structural induction on the tree 't'.\n   - Base case: Leaf\n   - Inductive case: Node l v r\n\n3. Proof Outline:\n   a. Start with 'intros t' to introduce the tree variable.\n   b. Use 'induction t' to set up structural induction.\n   c. For the Leaf case:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation using the definitions.\n      - Show that they are equal (should be trivial).\n   d. For the Node case:\n      - We have induction hypotheses for left and right subtrees.\n      - Expand the definitions of tree_reverse and tree_size.\n      - Use the induction hypotheses to rewrite the sizes of reversed subtrees.\n      - Prove that the resulting expressions are equal.\n\n4. Key Steps:\n   - Use simpl to simplify expressions when needed.\n   - Apply induction hypotheses using rewrite.\n   - Use lia (Linear Integer Arithmetic) to solve arithmetic equalities.\n\n5. Potential Challenges:\n   - Dealing with nested function applications (tree_size of tree_reverse).\n   - Ensuring all necessary simplifications are performed.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, use Qed to check its correctness.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, but we've encountered an issue in the final step of the Node case. The equality we need to prove is true, but it's not syntactically identical due to the commutative nature of addition. To resolve this, we have several options:\n\n1. Use the 'ring' tactic: This is a powerful tactic that can handle equalities in commutative rings, which includes integer addition. It will automatically deal with the commutativity of addition in our equation.\n\n2. Use the 'lia' tactic: This tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) is capable of solving linear inequalities and equalities over integers, which includes our current equation.\n\n3. Manually rewrite the expression: We could use lemmas about the commutativity and associativity of addition to rewrite one side of the equation to match the other before applying reflexivity.\n\nGiven that we've already imported the necessary libraries (including Psatz which provides 'lia'), and considering the simplicity of our equation, I recommend using the 'lia' tactic. It's straightforward, efficient, and directly applicable to our situation.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should replace the final 'reflexivity.' tactic with 'lia.'. This should successfully complete the proof by handling the arithmetic equality automatically.\n",
