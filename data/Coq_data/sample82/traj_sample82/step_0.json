    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem or_assoc2 involves logical disjunction (OR) and its associativity.\n   - We need to prove: (P \\/ Q) \\/ R -> P \\/ (Q \\/ R) for any propositions P, Q, and R.\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use a direct proof strategy.\n   - Introduce the hypothesis and goal.\n   - Apply case analysis on the outer disjunction (P \\/ Q) \\/ R.\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the propositions P, Q, and R.\n   b. Introduce the hypothesis H: (P \\/ Q) \\/ R.\n   c. Use destruct on H to handle two cases:\n      - Case 1: P \\/ Q\n      - Case 2: R\n   d. For Case 1 (P \\/ Q):\n      - Use nested destruct to further split into:\n        - Subcase 1a: P\n        - Subcase 1b: Q\n   e. For each subcase and Case 2:\n      - Use appropriate tactics (e.g., left, right) to prove the goal P \\/ (Q \\/ R).\n\n4. Consider using lemmas or library theorems:\n   - The proof seems straightforward without needing additional lemmas.\n   - However, be aware of useful tactics like 'tauto' for propositional logic.\n\n5. Reflect on potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of nested disjunctions.\n   - Pay attention to the order of propositions in the goal.\n\n6. Prepare for verification:\n   - After completing the proof, use Qed to check its correctness.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned approach:\n\n1. We need to introduce the propositions P, Q, and R as universally quantified variables.\n\n2. After introducing these propositions, we should introduce the hypothesis (P \\/ Q) \\/ R.\n\n3. Once we have the hypothesis, we can begin the case analysis by destructing the outer disjunction.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with steps 3a, 3b, and 3c of our planned proof outline. By starting with these steps, we set up the proof structure and prepare for the more detailed case analysis that will follow.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these initial steps using appropriate Coq tactics. This will create a solid foundation for the rest of the proof.\n",
