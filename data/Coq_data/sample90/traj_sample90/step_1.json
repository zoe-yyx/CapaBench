Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if P1 is equivalent to P2, and Q1 is equivalent to Q2, then (P1 or Q1) is equivalent to (P2 or Q2).\n   - We need to prove a bi-directional implication (<->).\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros P1 Q1 P2 Q2 H1 H2\" to introduce all variables and hypotheses.\n   - H1 will represent (P1 <-> P2)\n   - H2 will represent (Q1 <-> Q2)\n\n3. Split the main goal into two directions:\n   - Use \"split\" tactic to generate two subgoals:\n     a. (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2)\n     b. (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1)\n\n4. Prove the first direction (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: \"intros H\"\n   - Use \"destruct H\" to consider cases where either P1 or Q1 is true\n   - For each case, use the corresponding part of H1 or H2 to prove P2 or Q2\n   - Use \"left\" or \"right\" tactics to choose the appropriate side of the disjunction\n\n5. Prove the second direction (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1):\n   - Follow a similar approach as in step 4, but use the opposite direction of the equivalences in H1 and H2\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof, we have successfully introduced the variables and hypotheses, and split the main goal into two subgoals. Now, we need to focus on proving the first subgoal: P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2.\n\nTo prove this implication, we should:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis P1 \\/ Q1.\n2. Use a case analysis on this hypothesis to consider two cases: when P1 is true and when Q1 is true.\n3. In each case, we'll use the corresponding part of H1 or H2 to prove that either P2 or Q2 is true, which will establish P2 \\/ Q2.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis: We should use \"intros H\" to introduce P1 \\/ Q1 as a hypothesis.\n2. Perform case analysis: Use \"destruct H\" to split into two cases: P1 and Q1.\n3. For the P1 case:\n   - We'll have P1 as a hypothesis.\n   - Use the forward direction of H1 (P1 -> P2) to prove P2.\n   - Then use \"left\" tactic to prove P2 \\/ Q2.\n4. For the Q1 case:\n   - We'll have Q1 as a hypothesis.\n   - Use the forward direction of H2 (Q1 -> Q2) to prove Q2.\n   - Then use \"right\" tactic to prove P2 \\/ Q2.\n\nThis approach will effectively prove the first subgoal, setting us up to tackle the second subgoal in the next step.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt incorrectly assumed that H was a disjunction that could be destructed, leading to errors in subsequent steps.\n\nImprovement: We should start by introducing all the variables and hypotheses correctly, then split the goal into two implications and prove each direction separately using the given equivalences.\n```\n\nThe current approach had several issues:\n\n1. The first intros command only introduced one variable (H) instead of all the necessary variables and hypotheses.\n2. The proof attempted to destruct H as if it were a disjunction, which it is not.\n3. Subsequent steps tried to use non-existent hypotheses (HP1, HQ1) and apply tactics that weren't applicable to the current goal.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Properly introduce all variables and hypotheses:\n   intros P1 Q1 P2 Q2 H1 H2.\n\n2. Split the main goal into two implications:\n   split.\n\n3. For the forward direction (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: intros [HP1 | HQ1].\n   - Use case analysis and apply the appropriate part of H1 or H2.\n\n4. For the backward direction (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: intros [HP2 | HQ2].\n   - Use case analysis and apply the appropriate part of H1 or H2.\n\n5. Use the correct tactics (left, right, apply) at each step to build the proof.\n\nThis structured approach will align better with the theorem's statement and avoid the errors encountered in the previous attempt.",
