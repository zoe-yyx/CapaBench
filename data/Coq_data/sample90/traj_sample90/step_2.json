    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem or_congr:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if P1 is equivalent to P2, and Q1 is equivalent to Q2, then (P1 or Q1) is equivalent to (P2 or Q2).\n   - We need to prove a bi-directional implication (<->).\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros P1 Q1 P2 Q2 H1 H2\" to introduce all variables and hypotheses.\n   - H1 will represent (P1 <-> P2)\n   - H2 will represent (Q1 <-> Q2)\n\n3. Split the main goal into two directions:\n   - Use \"split\" tactic to generate two subgoals:\n     a. (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2)\n     b. (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1)\n\n4. Prove the first direction (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: \"intros H\"\n   - Use \"destruct H\" to consider cases where either P1 or Q1 is true\n   - For each case, use the corresponding part of H1 or H2 to prove P2 or Q2\n   - Use \"left\" or \"right\" tactics to choose the appropriate side of the disjunction\n\n5. Prove the second direction (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1):\n   - Follow a similar approach as in step 4, but use the opposite direction of the equivalences in H1 and H2\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - The proof should be complete after proving both directions\n   - Use \"Qed\" to finish the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and utilizing the given hypotheses effectively.\n",

For the first subgoal (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis with \"intros [HP1 | HQ1]\" to consider both cases of the disjunction.\n   - For the HP1 case, use \"left\" and apply the forward direction of H1.\n   - For the HQ1 case, use \"right\" and apply the forward direction of H2.\n\n4. For the second subgoal (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis with \"intros [HP2 | HQ2]\" to consider both cases of the disjunction.\n   - For the HP2 case, use \"left\" and apply the backward direction of H1.\n   - For the HQ2 case, use \"right\" and apply the backward direction of H2.\n\nThis approach will systematically prove both directions of the equivalence, utilizing the given hypotheses H1 and H2 correctly.\n",
