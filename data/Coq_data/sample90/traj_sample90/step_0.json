Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if P1 is equivalent to P2, and Q1 is equivalent to Q2, then (P1 or Q1) is equivalent to (P2 or Q2).\n   - We need to prove a bi-directional implication (<->).\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with \"intros P1 Q1 P2 Q2 H1 H2\" to introduce all variables and hypotheses.\n   - H1 will represent (P1 <-> P2)\n   - H2 will represent (Q1 <-> Q2)\n\n3. Split the main goal into two directions:\n   - Use \"split\" tactic to generate two subgoals:\n     a. (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2)\n     b. (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1)\n\n4. Prove the first direction (P1 \\/ Q1 -> P2 \\/ Q2):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: \"intros H\"\n   - Use \"destruct H\" to consider cases where either P1 or Q1 is true\n   - For each case, use the corresponding part of H1 or H2 to prove P2 or Q2\n   - Use \"left\" or \"right\" tactics to choose the appropriate side of the disjunction\n\n5. Prove the second direction (P2 \\/ Q2 -> P1 \\/ Q1):\n   - Follow a similar approach as in step 4, but use the opposite direction of the equivalences in H1 and H2\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - The proof should be complete after proving both directions\n   - Use \"Qed\" to finish the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and utilizing the given hypotheses effectively.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the first steps of our strategic proving plan. The reasoning for the next operation is as follows:\n\n1. We need to introduce all the variables and hypotheses mentioned in the theorem statement. This will set up our proof environment with all the necessary components.\n\n2. After introducing the variables and hypotheses, we should split the main goal into two directions as per our plan. This is because we're dealing with a bi-directional implication (<->), which requires us to prove both directions separately.\n\n3. The split will give us two subgoals to work on, which aligns with steps 4 and 5 of our plan.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should:\n1. Introduce the variables P1, Q1, P2, Q2, and the hypotheses for (P1 <-> P2) and (Q1 <-> Q2).\n2. Split the main goal into two subgoals.\n\nThis will set up the structure for the rest of the proof and allow us to tackle each direction of the implication separately in the subsequent steps.\n",
