    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for or_and_distr_l:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that P \\/ (Q /\\ R) is logically equivalent to (P \\/ Q) /\\ (P \\/ R) for any propositions P, Q, and R.\n   - We need to prove both directions of the bi-implication (<->).\n\n2. Break down the proof into two main parts:\n   a. Left to right: P \\/ (Q /\\ R) -> (P \\/ Q) /\\ (P \\/ R)\n   b. Right to left: (P \\/ Q) // (P \\/ R) -> P \\/ (Q /\\ R)\n\n3. Prove left to right:\n   - Use intros to bring P, Q, R into the context.\n   - Apply split to prove both conjuncts separately.\n   - For each conjunct, use destruct on the hypothesis P \\/ (Q /\\ R).\n   - Handle each case (P, Q /\\ R) using appropriate tactics (left, right, etc.).\n\n4. Prove right to left:\n   - Again, use intros for P, Q, R and the hypothesis.\n   - Destruct the hypothesis (P \\/ Q) /\\ (P \\/ R) into two parts.\n   - Use destruct on both parts to handle all possible combinations.\n   - For each case, construct the proof of P \\/ (Q /\\ R) using left or right tactics.\n\n5. Use automation:\n   - Consider using tactics like tauto or intuition to simplify the proof process.\n   - These tactics are particularly effective for propositional logic problems like this one.\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed.\n   - Use Qed to complete the proof.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and suggesting tactics to use at each stage.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the first steps of our planning strategy. Here's the reasoning for the next actions:\n\n1. Begin the proof by introducing the propositions P, Q, and R into the context. This will allow us to work with these propositions throughout the proof.\n\n2. After introducing the propositions, we should split the bi-implication (<->) into two separate implications. This aligns with our plan to prove both directions separately.\n\n3. For the left-to-right direction (P \\/ (Q /\\ R) -> (P \\/ Q) /\\ (P \\/ R)), we should:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis P \\/ (Q /\\ R)\n   b. Use the 'split' tactic to separate the goal into two subgoals: (P \\/ Q) and (P \\/ R)\n   c. For each subgoal, we'll need to use case analysis on the hypothesis P \\/ (Q /\\ R)\n\n4. Given the nature of this theorem, which involves only propositional logic, we might consider using the 'tauto' tactic at the end to see if it can automatically solve the entire proof or simplify it significantly.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I recommend that the acting agent start with introducing the propositions and splitting the bi-implication. If 'tauto' doesn't solve it immediately, we'll proceed with the manual proof steps as outlined.\n",
