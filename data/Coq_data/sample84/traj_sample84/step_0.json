    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The theorem is named \"modus_ponens\"\n   - It involves two propositions P and Q\n   - The goal is to prove that if we have (P /\\ (P -> Q)), then Q follows\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Start with \"intros\" to bring P, Q, and the hypothesis into the context\n   - Use \"destruct\" to break down the conjunction (P /\\ (P -> Q))\n   - Apply the implication (P -> Q) to P to derive Q\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Use \"intros P Q H\" to introduce P, Q, and the hypothesis\n   b. Use \"destruct H as [HP HPQ]\" to separate the conjunction into two parts:\n      - HP: P\n      - HPQ: P -> Q\n   c. Apply HPQ to HP using \"apply HPQ in HP\" or \"apply HPQ; assumption\"\n   d. The goal should now be solved, use \"exact HP\" or just \"assumption\"\n\n4. Finalize the proof:\n   - End with \"Qed\" to complete the proof\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof is straightforward and doesn't require any of the imported libraries\n   - No advanced tactics or automation are needed for this simple logical inference\n   - This proof demonstrates the basic principle of modus ponens in propositional logic\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the modus_ponens theorem, our first step should be to introduce the variables and hypothesis into the context. This aligns with the first part of our planning strategy.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to start by introducing the propositions P and Q, as well as the hypothesis that combines them (P /\\ (P -> Q)).\n2. The \"intros\" tactic is the appropriate tool for this step.\n3. We should name our hypothesis for easier reference in later steps. A common convention is to use H for the main hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the \"intros\" tactic to bring P, Q, and the hypothesis into the context. This will set up the proof environment for the subsequent steps of breaking down the conjunction and applying the implication.\n\nThe specific tactic to use should be:\nintros P Q H.\n\nThis action will introduce P and Q as propositions in our context, and H as the hypothesis representing (P /\\ (P -> Q)). After this step, we'll be ready to destruct the conjunction in H, which will be our next move in the proof.\n",
