Analyze the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that square 5 = 25.\n   - We have a definition of 'square' function provided.\n\n2.

Verify the result:\n   - Ensure that the computed result matches the expected outcome of 25.\n\n6. Complete the proof:\n   - Once the computation is done, the proof should be straightforward.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- No complex tactics or lemmas seem necessary for this simple arithmetic proof.\n- The Local Open Scope Z suggests we're working with integers, so standard integer arithmetic should apply.\n- The imported libraries (Setoid, ZArith, Psatz) aren't directly needed for this specific proof but might be useful for more complex problems in the same context.\n\nThis plan should lead to a concise and direct proof of the square_5 theorem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem square_5, and following our strategic plan, the next logical step is to unfold the definition of 'square' for the specific case of 5.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem statement square_5 claims that square 5 = 25.\n2. We have a definition of 'square' that needs to be applied to the value 5.\n3. Unfolding this definition will allow us to see the actual computation that needs to be performed.\n4. By unfolding, we'll transform 'square 5' into its equivalent arithmetic expression '5 * 5'.\n5. This step is crucial as it exposes the underlying calculation, setting the stage for the subsequent simplification and computation steps.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on unfolding the definition of 'square' in the context of the value 5. This will transform the goal into a more concrete arithmetic statement, which can then be easily computed in the following steps.\n",
