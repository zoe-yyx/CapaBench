    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the shift_up1_shift_left1_comm theorem, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by introducing the function f, as it's a universally quantified variable in our theorem.\n\n2. Use functional extensionality to prove the equality of functions. This means we need to show that for any input x, the left-hand side of the equation equals the right-hand side.\n\n3. Introduce an arbitrary input x.\n\n4. Unfold the definitions of shift_up1 and shift_left1 on both sides of the equality. This will allow us to work with the concrete expressions rather than the abstract function compositions.\n\n5. After unfolding, we should see that both sides of the equation simplify to expressions involving f(x+1) + 1. At this point, the equality should become apparent.\n\n6. Use simplification tactics to reduce both sides to their simplest form.\n\n7. Once both sides are simplified, we should be able to prove their equality using reflexivity.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I suggest the acting agent start with introducing f and x, then use functional extensionality to set up the proof structure. After that, we can proceed with unfolding definitions and simplifying the expressions.\n",
