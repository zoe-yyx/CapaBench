    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving a lemma about the injection property of the Node constructor in a binary tree structure.\n   - The goal is to show that if two Node constructions are equal, their value components must be equal.\n\n2. Understand the tree structure:\n   - The tree is defined inductively with two constructors: Leaf and Node.\n   - Node takes three arguments: left subtree (l), value (v), and right subtree (r).\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with an intros statement to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n   b. Use the injection tactic on the equality hypothesis to break it down.\n   c. The injection should generate three new equalities, one for each component of the Node.\n   d. Focus on the equality related to the value component.\n   e. Use the reflexivity tactic to prove the goal.\n\n4. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure that the injection tactic is applied correctly to generate the required equalities.\n   - Be prepared to handle any additional hypotheses that may be generated.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward and concise, likely not requiring any complex tactics or lemmas.\n   - If any issues arise, consider using the inversion tactic as an alternative to injection.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed and there are no remaining obligations.\n   - Check that the proof relies only on the given hypothesis and doesn't introduce any unnecessary assumptions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection provided, here's the reasoning to guide the next action:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced all necessary hypotheses and performed the injection on the equality hypothesis H.\n\n2. The injection gave us three new hypotheses: Hr (r1 = r2), Hv (v1 = v2), and Hl (l1 = l2).\n\n3. Our current goal is to prove v1 = v2, which is exactly what the hypothesis Hv states.\n\n4. The reflexivity tactic failed because it tries to prove equality by showing that both sides are syntactically identical, which they are not in this case.\n\n5. Instead of trying to prove the equality from scratch, we can use the hypothesis Hv that we already have, which directly states what we need to prove.\n\n6. The exact tactic is ideal for this situation as it allows us to provide an exact proof term for our goal.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the exact tactic with the Hv hypothesis. This will directly prove our goal using the equality we obtained from the injection of the original hypothesis.\n\nThe acting agent should apply the following tactic:\n\nexact Hv.\n\nThis should complete the proof successfully, as it provides the exact equality we need to prove our goal.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The tactic 'exact Hv' failed because the hypothesis Hv was not introduced in the current proof context.\n\nImprovement: We need to introduce the necessary hypotheses and perform the injection on the equality hypothesis before using 'exact Hv'.\n```\n\nBased on this reflection, here are some actionable insights for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to start the proof by introducing the variables and the hypothesis. This can be done using the 'intros' tactic.\n\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we should perform an injection on the equality hypothesis. This will give us the needed equality v1 = v2 as a separate hypothesis.\n\n3. Only after these steps should we attempt to use 'exact Hv' to complete the proof.\n\n4. The proof structure should look something like this:\n   - intros l1 v1 r1 l2 v2 r2 H.\n   - injection H as Hr Hv Hl.\n   - exact Hv.\n\n5. We should ensure that each step is executed correctly before moving to the next one. This means verifying that the hypotheses are properly introduced and the injection is successful before attempting to use 'exact Hv'.\n\n6. If at any point the proof state is unclear, we should use tactics like 'Print All.' or 'Show Proof.' to get more information about the current context and progress.\n\nFor the next round, the planning agent should focus on structuring the proof as outlined above, and the reasoning and acting agents should implement these steps carefully, ensuring each tactic succeeds before moving to the next one.",
