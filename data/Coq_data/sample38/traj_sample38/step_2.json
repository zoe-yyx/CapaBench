    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving a lemma about the injection property of the Node constructor in a binary tree structure.\n   - The goal is to show that if two Node constructions are equal, their value components must be equal.\n\n2. Understand the tree structure:\n   - The tree is defined inductively with two constructors: Leaf and Node.\n   - Node takes three arguments: left subtree (l), value (v), and right subtree (r).\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with an intros statement to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n   b. Use the injection tactic on the equality hypothesis to break it down.\n   c. The injection should generate three new equalities, one for each component of the Node.\n   d. Focus on the equality related to the value component.\n   e. Use the reflexivity tactic to prove the goal.\n\n4. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure that the injection tactic is applied correctly to generate the required equalities.\n   - Be prepared to handle any additional hypotheses that may be generated.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward and concise, likely not requiring any complex tactics or lemmas.\n   - If any issues arise, consider using the inversion tactic as an alternative to injection.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed and there are no remaining obligations.\n   - Check that the proof relies only on the given hypothesis and doesn't introduce any unnecessary assumptions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start the proof from the beginning, as the previous attempt failed due to missing hypotheses.\n\n2. The first step should be to introduce all the variables and the equality hypothesis into the context. This can be done using the 'intros' tactic.\n\n3. After introduction, we should use the 'injection' tactic on the equality hypothesis. This will break down the Node constructor equality into equalities of its components.\n\n4. The injection should produce three new hypotheses, one of which will be the equality we need (v1 = v2).\n\n5. Once we have the required equality hypothesis, we can use 'exact' to prove the goal.\n\n6. If the 'injection' tactic doesn't automatically name the resulting hypotheses, we may need to use 'as' to name them explicitly.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start with the 'intros' tactic, followed by 'injection' on the equality hypothesis. After that, depending on the result, either use 'exact' directly if the hypothesis is named, or use 'as' to name the hypotheses before using 'exact'.\n",
