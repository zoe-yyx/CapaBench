    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The problem involves proving a lemma about the injection property of the Node constructor in a binary tree structure.\n   - The goal is to show that if two Node constructions are equal, their value components must be equal.\n\n2. Understand the tree structure:\n   - The tree is defined inductively with two constructors: Leaf and Node.\n   - Node takes three arguments: left subtree (l), value (v), and right subtree (r).\n\n3. Plan the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with an intros statement to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n   b. Use the injection tactic on the equality hypothesis to break it down.\n   c. The injection should generate three new equalities, one for each component of the Node.\n   d. Focus on the equality related to the value component.\n   e. Use the reflexivity tactic to prove the goal.\n\n4. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure that the injection tactic is applied correctly to generate the required equalities.\n   - Be prepared to handle any additional hypotheses that may be generated.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - The proof should be straightforward and concise, likely not requiring any complex tactics or lemmas.\n   - If any issues arise, consider using the inversion tactic as an alternative to injection.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed and there are no remaining obligations.\n   - Check that the proof relies only on the given hypothesis and doesn't introduce any unnecessary assumptions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned strategy step by step:\n\n1. The first step should be to introduce all the variables and the hypothesis into the context. This will allow us to work with these elements in our proof.\n\n2. After introducing the variables and hypothesis, we should apply the injection tactic to the equality hypothesis. This tactic is crucial for our proof as it will break down the equality of the Node constructors into equalities of their components.\n\n3. The injection tactic should generate three new equalities, one for each component of the Node constructor (left subtree, value, and right subtree). Among these, we are particularly interested in the equality related to the value component, as this is what we need to prove.\n\n4. Once we have the equality for the value component, the proof should be straightforward. We can use the reflexivity tactic to prove that v1 = v2, which is our goal.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent start with the intros tactic to bring all variables and the hypothesis into the context, and then proceed with the injection tactic on the equality hypothesis. This will set up the proof environment for the subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The reflexivity tactic failed because it attempted to prove v1 = v2 directly, without using the available hypothesis Hv.\n\nImprovement: Instead of using reflexivity, we should use the exact tactic with the hypothesis Hv to prove v1 = v2, as this equality is already given to us after the injection.\n```\n\nThe current approach was close to solving the problem, but it overlooked a crucial step. Let's break down what happened and how we can improve:\n\n1. The introduction of variables and the injection of the hypothesis H were correct steps.\n\n2. After the injection, we correctly introduced three new hypotheses: Hr (r1 = r2), Hv (v1 = v2), and Hl (l1 = l2).\n\n3. The mistake occurred in the final step. Instead of using reflexivity, which tries to prove the goal by showing that both sides are syntactically identical, we should have used the hypothesis Hv that we already have.\n\n4. The hypothesis Hv is exactly what we need to prove our goal, so we can use it directly.\n\nFor the next action, I suggest using the exact tactic with the Hv hypothesis. This will complete the proof successfully. The command should be:\n\nexact Hv.\n\nThis approach directly uses the equality we obtained from the injection, which is precisely what we need to prove. It aligns perfectly with our goal of proving v1 = v2 and uses the information we've extracted from the original hypothesis effectively.",
