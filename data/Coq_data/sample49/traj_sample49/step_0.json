Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named \"and_intro\"\n   - It's a basic logical theorem about the introduction of conjunction (AND)\n   - The type is: forall A B: Prop, A -> B -> A /\\ B\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to bring the universally quantified variables and hypotheses into the context\n   - Use the 'split' tactic to prove both parts of the conjunction\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Introduce the propositions A and B\n   b. Introduce the hypotheses for A and B\n   c. Use the 'split' tactic to separate the goal into two subgoals\n   d. Prove each subgoal using the corresponding hypothesis\n\n4. Consider potential challenges:\n   - This is a straightforward logical theorem, so no significant challenges are expected\n   - Ensure proper use of the 'split' tactic for handling conjunction\n\n5. Reflect on the proof:\n   - This proof demonstrates the basic principle of conjunction introduction in propositional logic\n   - It shows how to construct a proof of A /\\ B given proofs of A and B separately\n\n6. Additional notes:\n   - While the problem imports several libraries, this specific theorem doesn't require any special tactics or lemmas from these libraries\n   - The proof can be completed using only basic Coq tactics\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem \"and_intro\", which states \"forall A B: Prop, A -> B -> A /\\ B\", we should start by following the planned proof structure.\n\n1. The first step should be to introduce the universally quantified variables A and B into the context. This will allow us to work with these propositions directly.\n\n2. After introducing A and B, we should introduce the hypotheses for A and B. These hypotheses represent the assumptions that we have proofs for A and B separately.\n\n3. Once we have A and B in the context along with their respective hypotheses, we'll be in a position to prove A /\\ B.\n\n4. To prove A /\\ B, we'll need to use the 'split' tactic. This tactic is specifically designed for handling conjunctions and will separate our goal into two subgoals: proving A and proving B.\n\n5. After splitting, we can prove each subgoal using the corresponding hypothesis that we introduced earlier.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I recommend that the acting agent start by using the 'intros' tactic to bring A, B, and the hypotheses for A and B into the context. This will set up the proof environment for the subsequent steps.\n",
