    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by following the first steps of our planned strategy. The theorem involves universal quantification and an implication, so our first action should be to introduce all the variables and hypotheses into our context.\n\nSpecifically, we should:\n\n1. Introduce the type X and the predicates P, Q, and R.\n2. Introduce the first hypothesis, which states that for all x, if P x and Q x hold, then R x holds.\n3. Introduce x (the variable in the conclusion) and the hypothesis that P x and Q x hold.\n\nThis will set up our proof environment with all the necessary components to work with. After this introduction step, we'll be in a good position to start manipulating these hypotheses to prove our goal.\n\nThe acting agent should use the 'intros' tactic to accomplish this. This tactic will bring all these elements into our proof context, allowing us to refer to them in subsequent steps of the proof.\n",
