    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem logic_ex6 is a universally quantified statement over a type A and two predicates P and Q.\n   - It also involves a specific element a0 of type A.\n\n2. Analyze the hypotheses and goal:\n   - Hypothesis 1: P a0 (P holds for a0)\n   - Hypothesis 2: forall a: A, P a -> Q a (For all a in A, if P holds for a, then Q holds for a)\n   - Goal: Q a0 (We need to prove Q holds for a0)\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses:\n      - Introduce A, P, Q, and a0\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that P holds for a0\n      - Introduce the hypothesis about the implication from P to Q for all a\n\n   b. Apply the second hypothesis to a0:\n      - This will give us: P a0 -> Q a0\n\n   c. Use modus ponens:\n      - We have P a0 from the first hypothesis\n      - We have P a0 -> Q a0 from step b\n      - Therefore, we can conclude Q a0\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - The goal Q a0 should now be proved\n\n5. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the universal hypothesis to a0\n   - exact: to use the first hypothesis directly\n\nThis plan follows a straightforward logical deduction, making use of the given hypotheses to directly prove the goal. The proof should be relatively short and clear.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe need to start by introducing all the variables and hypotheses into our proof context. This will set up the environment correctly for our subsequent proof steps. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. We have a universally quantified statement with several variables (A, P, Q, a0) and two hypotheses.\n\n2. To work with these, we need to bring them into our proof context using the 'intros' tactic.\n\n3. After introduction, we'll have:\n   - A: Type\n   - P, Q: A -> Prop\n   - a0: A\n   - H1: P a0\n   - H2: forall a : A, P a -> Q a\n\n4. With these in our context, we can then proceed to apply H2 to a0, which will give us the implication P a0 -> Q a0.\n\n5. Finally, we can use H1 (which states P a0) to prove Q a0.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by using the 'intros' tactic to bring all variables and hypotheses into the proof context. This will set up the proof environment correctly for the subsequent steps.\n",
