Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem logic_ex6 is a universally quantified statement over a type A and two predicates P and Q.\n   - It also involves a specific element a0 of type A.\n\n2. Analyze the hypotheses and goal:\n   - Hypothesis 1: P a0 (P holds for a0)\n   - Hypothesis 2: forall a: A, P a -> Q a (For all a in A, if P holds for a, then Q holds for a)\n   - Goal: Q a0 (We need to prove Q holds for a0)\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses:\n      - Introduce A, P, Q, and a0\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that P holds for a0\n      - Introduce the hypothesis about the implication from P to Q for all a\n\n   b. Apply the second hypothesis to a0:\n      - This will give us: P a0 -> Q a0\n\n   c. Use modus ponens:\n      - We have P a0 from the first hypothesis\n      - We have P a0 -> Q a0 from step b\n      - Therefore, we can conclude Q a0\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - The goal Q a0 should now be proved\n\n5. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the universal hypothesis to a0\n   - exact: to use the first hypothesis directly\n\nThis plan follows a straightforward logical deduction, making use of the given hypotheses to directly prove the goal. The proof should be relatively short and clear.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem logic_ex6, we should follow the plan step by step. Since we haven't taken any actions yet, we'll start with the first step of introducing the universal quantifiers and hypotheses.\n\nThe acting agent should use the 'intros' tactic to introduce all the variables and hypotheses mentioned in the theorem statement. This will set up our proof environment with all the necessary assumptions.\n\nSpecifically, the acting agent should introduce:\n1. A (the type)\n2. P and Q (the predicates)\n3. a0 (the specific element of type A)\n4. A hypothesis for P a0\n5. A hypothesis for the universal statement (forall a: A, P a -> Q a)\n\nAfter this introduction, we'll have all the pieces we need to proceed with the next steps of the proof. The goal at this point should still be to prove Q a0, but we'll have the necessary hypotheses available to work with.\n\nTherefore, the next operation for the acting agent should be to use the 'intros' tactic to set up the proof environment as described above.\n",
