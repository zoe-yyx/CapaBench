    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem logic_ex6 is a universally quantified statement over a type A and two predicates P and Q.\n   - It also involves a specific element a0 of type A.\n\n2. Analyze the hypotheses and goal:\n   - Hypothesis 1: P a0 (P holds for a0)\n   - Hypothesis 2: forall a: A, P a -> Q a (For all a in A, if P holds for a, then Q holds for a)\n   - Goal: Q a0 (We need to prove Q holds for a0)\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the universal quantifiers and hypotheses:\n      - Introduce A, P, Q, and a0\n      - Introduce the hypothesis that P holds for a0\n      - Introduce the hypothesis about the implication from P to Q for all a\n\n   b. Apply the second hypothesis to a0:\n      - This will give us: P a0 -> Q a0\n\n   c. Use modus ponens:\n      - We have P a0 from the first hypothesis\n      - We have P a0 -> Q a0 from step b\n      - Therefore, we can conclude Q a0\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - The goal Q a0 should now be proved\n\n5. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the universal hypothesis to a0\n   - exact: to use the first hypothesis directly\n\nThis plan follows a straightforward logical deduction, making use of the given hypotheses to directly prove the goal. The proof should be relatively short and clear.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced all the variables and hypotheses as planned. Now, we have:\n\n1. A : Type\n2. P, Q : A -> Prop\n3. a0 : A\n4. H1 : P a0\n5. H2 : forall a : A, P a -> Q a\n\nOur goal is to prove Q a0.\n\nThe next logical step is to apply the hypothesis H2 to our specific instance a0. This will give us the implication P a0 -> Q a0. We can then use this implication along with H1 (which states P a0) to conclude Q a0.\n\nTo achieve this, we should use the 'apply' tactic. Specifically, we want to apply H2 to a0. This will transform our goal into P a0, which we can then prove using H1.\n\nThe acting agent should use the tactic:\n\napply H2.\n\nThis will change our goal from Q a0 to P a0, setting us up for the final step of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The tactics 'apply H2' and 'exact H1' were used prematurely, before introducing the necessary hypotheses and variables into the context.\n\nImprovement: We need to start the proof by introducing the variables and hypotheses using the 'intros' tactic before attempting to apply any of them.\n```\n\nThe current result is unsatisfactory because we tried to use hypotheses (H1 and H2) that were not yet introduced into the proof context. This led to errors stating that these variables were not found in the current environment.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should begin the proof by properly introducing all the variables and hypotheses. Here's a suggested plan for the next steps:\n\n1. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring all the variables and hypotheses into the proof context. This should look like: 'intros A P Q a0 H1 H2'.\n\n2. After introducing the hypotheses, we can then proceed with the original plan of applying H2 and using H1.\n\n3. The proof structure should then be:\n   - intros A P Q a0 H1 H2.\n   - apply H2.\n   - exact H1.\n\nBy following this improved approach, we ensure that all necessary elements are in the proof context before we attempt to use them, which should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.",
