Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem logic_ex3 is a statement about logical implication and negation for predicates P and Q over a type A.\n   - It states that if P implies Q for all elements of A, then not Q implies not P for all elements of A.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use universal quantification introduction to handle 'forall A: Type'\n   - Use universal quantification introduction again for 'forall P Q: A -> Prop'\n   - Use universal quantification introduction a third time for 'forall a: A'\n   - Set up the hypothesis for '~ Q a'\n   - Aim to prove '~ P a'\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   - Start with 'intros' to bring all quantified variables and hypotheses into the context\n   - Use proof by contradiction:\n     a. Assume P a\n     b. Use the given hypothesis (forall a: A, P a -> Q a) to derive Q a\n     c. This contradicts the assumption ~ Q a\n   - Conclude ~ P a from the contradiction\n\n4. Key steps:\n   - Use 'intros' multiple times to set up the proof context\n   - Apply the hypothesis (forall a: A, P a -> Q a) to the assumed P a\n   - Use 'contradiction' or similar tactic to derive False from Q a and ~ Q a\n   - Use 'not_intro' or similar to conclude ~ P a\n\n5.

Verification:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are used\n   - Check that the final goal matches the theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the problem description and the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the proof context. The theorem involves multiple universal quantifications and an implication, so our first step should be to introduce all the variables and hypotheses into the context.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should use the 'intros' tactic to bring all quantified variables and hypotheses into the context. This will allow us to work with concrete instances of A, P, Q, and a, as well as the hypothesis that relates P and Q.\n\n2. After introducing these elements, we'll be in a position to start the proof by contradiction for the conclusion ~(P a).\n\n3. The 'intros' tactic should be used with appropriate variable names to make the proof more readable. Suggested names could be:\n   - A for the type\n   - P and Q for the predicates\n   - H for the hypothesis (forall a: A, P a -> Q a)\n   - a for the specific element of A\n   - HnQ for the hypothesis ~Q a\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use an 'intros' tactic to set up the proof context, bringing all the necessary elements into the local context for further manipulation.\n",
