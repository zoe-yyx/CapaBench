Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem 'or_introl' states that for any two propositions A and B, if A is true, then A or B is true.\n   - This is a fundamental property of logical disjunction.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to introduce the propositions A and B, and the hypothesis that A is true.\n   - Use the left introduction rule for disjunction to prove A \\/ B.\n\n3. Proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the variables and hypothesis:\n      - intros A B HA\n   b. Apply the left introduction rule for disjunction:\n      - left\n   c. Use the hypothesis HA to prove A:\n      - exact HA\n\n4. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure that all goals are solved.\n   - Check that the proof is complete and Qed is accepted.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - This theorem is relatively simple and doesn't require any complex tactics or lemmas.\n   - The proof should be straightforward and concise.\n   - No additional lemmas or theorems from the imported libraries are needed for this proof.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - After completing the proof, consider if there are any alternative ways to prove this theorem.\n   - Think about how this theorem might be used in more complex proofs involving disjunctions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem 'or_introl', we should start by following the planned proof structure. The first step is to introduce the variables and the hypothesis. This will set up our proof environment with the necessary assumptions.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to introduce two propositions A and B, as well as a hypothesis that A is true.\n2. The 'intros' tactic is the appropriate choice for this step.\n3. We should name our hypothesis for A being true as 'HA' for clarity.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in the proof is to use the 'intros' tactic to bring A, B, and the hypothesis for A into our context. This will prepare us for the subsequent steps of applying the left introduction rule for disjunction and using the hypothesis to complete the proof.\n",
