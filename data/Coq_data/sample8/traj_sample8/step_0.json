    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for One_plus_one_plus_one:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem states that applying plus_one twice to 1 should result in 3.\n   - We need to use the definition of plus_one and basic arithmetic.\n\n2. Unfold the definition:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of plus_one for both occurrences.\n   - This will transform the expression into basic arithmetic operations.\n\n3. Simplify the arithmetic:\n   - After unfolding, we'll have nested additions that need to be simplified.\n   - Use basic integer arithmetic to compute the final result.\n\n4. Utilize automation:\n   - Since this is a straightforward arithmetic equality, we can leverage Coq's built-in tactics for solving arithmetic problems.\n\n5. Proving steps:\n   a. Unfold the definition of plus_one.\n   b. Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression.\n   c. Apply an appropriate tactic for solving arithmetic equalities.\n\n6. Potential tactics to use:\n   - unfold: To expand the definition of plus_one.\n   - simpl: To simplify arithmetic expressions.\n   - reflexivity: To prove equality if the sides are identical after simplification.\n   - lia: Linear Integer Arithmetic solver, which can handle this type of equality.\n\n7. Fallback strategy:\n   - If automation doesn't immediately solve the problem, consider breaking down the equality step-by-step using rewrite or replace tactics.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the One_plus_one_plus_one theorem, focusing on unfolding definitions, simplifying arithmetic, and leveraging Coq's automation capabilities.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem One_plus_one_plus_one, we should follow the strategic proving plan outlined earlier. The first step in our plan is to unfold the definition of plus_one.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem statement involves nested applications of plus_one, so we need to expand these to reveal the underlying arithmetic operations.\n2. Unfolding the definition will transform the expression \"plus_one (plus_one 1)\" into its explicit form using the addition operation.\n3. This step will make the arithmetic more apparent and set us up for subsequent simplification.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the 'unfold' tactic to expand the definition of plus_one. This aligns with step 5a in our proving plan and will allow us to see the actual arithmetic operations we're dealing with.\n\nAfter unfolding, we'll be in a better position to simplify the arithmetic and potentially solve the equality using Coq's built-in tactics for arithmetic reasoning.\n",
