    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start with induction on t1:\n   The problem involves comparing two trees, and we need to show that if their reversals are equal, then the original trees are equal. Structural induction on t1 is a natural way to approach this, as it allows us to consider all possible forms of t1.\n\n2. For the base case (t1 = Leaf):\n   We need to show that if tree_reverse Leaf = tree_reverse t2, then Leaf = t2. This will involve considering the possible forms of t2.\n\n3. For the inductive case (t1 = Node l1 v1 r1):\n   We'll need to show that if tree_reverse (Node l1 v1 r1) = tree_reverse t2, then Node l1 v1 r1 = t2. This will involve:\n   - Considering the possible forms of t2\n   - Using the induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees\n   - Breaking down the equality of the reversed trees into equalities of their components\n\n4. Use destruct t2 in both cases:\n   This will allow us to consider all possible forms of t2 and show that only the matching form satisfies the hypothesis.\n\n5. Use inversion on the hypothesis:\n   This tactic will help break down the equality of reversed trees into simpler equalities that we can work with.\n\n6. Apply the induction hypotheses:\n   In the inductive case, we'll need to use the induction hypotheses to show that the subtrees are equal.\n\n7. Reconstruct the final equality:\n   After showing that the components are equal, we'll need to put everything together to show that t1 = t2.\n\nThe acting agent should start by applying induction on t1, and then proceed with the base case by considering the possible forms of t2.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current proof attempt and the error messages, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was correct, but the implementation had errors in applying the induction hypotheses and handling the equalities.\n\nImprovement: Revise the inductive step by correctly applying the induction hypotheses and using the tree_reverse_inj property to establish equalities between the subtrees.\n```\n\nLet's break down the issues and suggest improvements:\n\n1. The base case for Leaf was handled correctly.\n\n2. In the inductive step, the attempt to use `rewrite (IHl l2), (IHr r2)` failed because the induction hypotheses were not in the correct form. The IHl and IHr are implications, not direct equalities.\n\n3. The attempt to use `reflexivity` after rewriting H2 failed because the other parts of the tree (l1, r1, l2, r2) were not proven equal.\n\n4. The attempts to use `assumption` after applying `f_equal tree_reverse` to H3 and H1 failed because these transformations didn't produce the needed equality.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. Use the induction hypotheses correctly. They should be applied to the equalities we have from the injection of H.\n\n2. Prove that `tree_reverse` is involutive (i.e., `tree_reverse (tree_reverse t) = t` for all t). This lemma will be useful in simplifying the equalities we get from applying `f_equal tree_reverse`.\n\n3. Use the involutive property to simplify the equalities and then apply the induction hypotheses.\n\n4. After establishing that l1 = l2 and r1 = r2, use these along with H2 (v1 = v2) to prove the final equality.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing these steps, particularly proving the involutive property of `tree_reverse` before completing the main theorem proof.",
