    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the tree_reverse function is injective.\n   - This means if tree_reverse of two trees are equal, then the original trees are equal.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use structural induction on t1.\n   - For each case, consider the possible forms of t2 that could lead to tree_reverse t1 = tree_reverse t2.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Base case: t1 = Leaf\n      - Consider possible forms of t2\n      - Show that only t2 = Leaf satisfies the hypothesis\n\n   b. Inductive case: t1 = Node l1 v1 r1\n      - Consider possible forms of t2\n      - Show that only t2 = Node l2 v2 r2 satisfies the hypothesis\n      - Use the induction hypothesis on the subtrees\n\n4. Key steps:\n   - Apply inversion on the hypothesis to break it down into simpler equalities\n   - Use the induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees\n   - Reconstruct the equality of t1 and t2\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling the case where t2 is not of the same form as t1\n   - Properly applying the induction hypotheses\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - induction t1: for structural induction\n   - destruct t2: to consider different forms of t2\n   - inversion: to break down equalities\n   - rewrite: to use induction hypotheses\n   - reflexivity: to prove trivial equalities\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to prove an auxiliary lemma that tree_reverse is involutive. This will be crucial for simplifying our equalities.\n\n2. For the main theorem proof:\n   a. In the base case (Leaf), the proof is complete.\n   b. For the inductive case (Node l1 v1 r1):\n      - After the injection of H, we have three equalities:\n        H1: tree_reverse r1 = tree_reverse r2\n        H2: v1 = v2\n        H3: tree_reverse l1 = tree_reverse l2\n      - We should apply the induction hypotheses to H1 and H3:\n        apply IHr in H1\n        apply IHl in H3\n      - This will give us:\n        H1: r1 = r2\n        H3: l1 = l2\n      - Then, we can use these equalities along with H2 to prove the final goal.\n\n3. Steps for the acting agent:\n   a. First, prove the auxiliary lemma:\n      Lemma tree_reverse_involutive: forall t, tree_reverse (tree_reverse t) = t.\n   b. Use this lemma in the main proof to simplify the equalities.\n   c. Apply the induction hypotheses correctly.\n   d. Use the resulting equalities to prove the final goal.\n\nThis approach should allow us to complete the proof without the previous errors.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because the auxiliary lemma tree_reverse_involutive was not properly defined and proven before being used in the main proof.\n\nImprovement: We need to first prove the tree_reverse_involutive lemma separately, and then use it in the main proof of tree_reverse_inj.\n```\n\nThe current approach was on the right track, but it encountered several issues:\n\n1. The auxiliary lemma tree_reverse_involutive was not properly defined and proven before being used in the main proof. This caused errors when trying to rewrite with it.\n\n2. The proof structure was not clearly separated between the auxiliary lemma and the main theorem, leading to confusion and nested proof errors.\n\n3. The induction strategy for the main theorem was not correctly set up, causing errors when trying to use induction hypotheses.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Start by proving the tree_reverse_involutive lemma separately and completely.\n\n2. Once that lemma is proven, begin the proof of the main theorem tree_reverse_inj.\n\n3. In the main theorem proof, use a different strategy that doesn't rely on induction directly, but instead uses the involutive property of tree_reverse.\n\n4. Clearly separate each proof with Qed before starting the next one.\n\n5. Be more careful with the syntax and structure of each proof step, ensuring that we're working within the correct context and with available hypotheses.\n\nBy following these improvements, we should be able to successfully complete the proof without using 'Admitted' and in a rigorous manner.",
