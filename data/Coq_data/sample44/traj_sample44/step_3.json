    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the tree_reverse function is injective.\n   - This means if tree_reverse of two trees are equal, then the original trees are equal.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use structural induction on t1.\n   - For each case, consider the possible forms of t2 that could lead to tree_reverse t1 = tree_reverse t2.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Base case: t1 = Leaf\n      - Consider possible forms of t2\n      - Show that only t2 = Leaf satisfies the hypothesis\n\n   b. Inductive case: t1 = Node l1 v1 r1\n      - Consider possible forms of t2\n      - Show that only t2 = Node l2 v2 r2 satisfies the hypothesis\n      - Use the induction hypothesis on the subtrees\n\n4. Key steps:\n   - Apply inversion on the hypothesis to break it down into simpler equalities\n   - Use the induction hypotheses for the left and right subtrees\n   - Reconstruct the equality of t1 and t2\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling the case where t2 is not of the same form as t1\n   - Properly applying the induction hypotheses\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - induction t1: for structural induction\n   - destruct t2: to consider different forms of t2\n   - inversion: to break down equalities\n   - rewrite: to use induction hypotheses\n   - reflexivity: to prove trivial equalities\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the theorem is fully proved\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start fresh with our proofs, as the previous attempt led to errors and incomplete proofs.\n\n2. First, we should prove the auxiliary lemma tree_reverse_involutive:\n   - Start the proof with \"Lemma tree_reverse_involutive: forall t, tree_reverse (tree_reverse t) = t.\"\n   - Use induction on t\n   - For the base case (Leaf), use simplification and reflexivity\n   - For the inductive case (Node), use simplification, rewrite with induction hypotheses, and reflexivity\n   - Close this proof with Qed\n\n3. After proving tree_reverse_involutive, we can proceed with the main theorem tree_reverse_inj:\n   - Start the proof with \"Lemma tree_reverse_inj: forall t1 t2, tree_reverse t1 = tree_reverse t2 -> t1 = t2.\"\n   - Use the following steps:\n     a. Introduce variables and hypothesis\n     b. Apply f_equal with tree_reverse to the hypothesis\n     c. Rewrite twice with tree_reverse_involutive\n     d. Conclude with the resulting equality\n\n4. Remember to start each proof with Proof. and end with Qed.\n\n5. By following this structured approach, we should be able to complete both proofs successfully and avoid the previous errors.\n",
