    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to start fresh with a clear, step-by-step approach to prove this theorem.\n\n2. First, we should prove the auxiliary lemma tree_reverse_involutive. This lemma states that applying tree_reverse twice to any tree results in the original tree. This is crucial for our main proof.\n\n3. To prove tree_reverse_involutive, we should use induction on the tree structure. This will handle both the base case (Leaf) and the inductive case (Node).\n\n4. Once tree_reverse_involutive is proven, we can move on to the main theorem tree_reverse_inj.\n\n5. For tree_reverse_inj, we can use a clever approach that doesn't require direct induction on the tree structure:\n   a. Apply tree_reverse to both sides of the equality in the hypothesis.\n   b. Use the involutive property (tree_reverse_involutive) to simplify both sides.\n   c. This will directly give us the desired equality.\n\n6. This approach is more elegant and avoids the need for complex induction in the main theorem.\n\n7. Remember to use proper syntax, separate the proofs clearly, and make sure each proof is completed before moving to the next one.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because the auxiliary lemma tree_reverse_involutive was not properly defined and proven before being used in the main theorem.\n\nImprovement: We need to first prove the tree_reverse_involutive lemma separately, then use it in the proof of tree_reverse_inj, ensuring each proof is completed with Qed before moving to the next one.\n```\n\nReflection:\n\n1. The main issue was that we tried to use the tree_reverse_involutive lemma before it was properly defined and proven. This caused errors when we attempted to rewrite with it in the main theorem's proof.\n\n2. We also made a mistake in the structure of our proof. We started proving the main theorem (tree_reverse_inj) without first proving the auxiliary lemma (tree_reverse_involutive). This led to confusion and errors in our proof steps.\n\n3. The induction steps we attempted were misplaced. They belonged to the proof of tree_reverse_involutive, not tree_reverse_inj.\n\n4. We didn't properly close each proof with Qed before starting a new one, which led to nested proof errors.\n\nTo improve our approach:\n\n1. We should start by proving the tree_reverse_involutive lemma separately and completely.\n\n2. After proving tree_reverse_involutive, we should close that proof with Qed.\n\n3. Only then should we start the proof of tree_reverse_inj, using the now-proven tree_reverse_involutive lemma.\n\n4. We should follow the correct structure for each proof: start with Proof., then add the proof steps, and end with Qed.\n\n5. In the proof of tree_reverse_inj, we should follow the planned approach of applying f_equal, then rewriting with tree_reverse_involutive.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to successfully complete both proofs and achieve our goal of proving the tree_reverse_inj theorem.",
