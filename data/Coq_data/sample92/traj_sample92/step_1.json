Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff-introduction tactic (split) to prove both directions of the equivalence\n\n3. Prove left-to-right direction (->):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for (P /\\ Q -> R)\n   - Introduce P and Q as separate hypotheses\n   - Apply the original hypothesis to prove R\n\n4. Prove right-to-left direction (<-):\n   - Introduce the hypothesis for (P -> Q -> R)\n   - Introduce the conjunction (P /\\ Q) as a hypothesis\n   - Destruct the conjunction to get P and Q separately\n   - Apply the original hypothesis to P and Q to prove R\n\n5. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - intros: to introduce hypotheses\n   - split: for iff-introduction\n   - apply: to apply hypotheses\n   - destruct: to break down conjunctions\n\n6. Consider using automation:\n   - The proof is relatively straightforward, so tactics like auto or tauto might be able to solve it entirely\n\n7. Reflect on the logical meaning:\n   - This theorem demonstrates the relationship between conjunction and implication\n   - It shows that a statement \"if P and Q, then R\" is logically equivalent to \"if P, then if Q, then R\"\n\n8. Prepare for potential extensions:\n   - This theorem might be useful in future proofs involving complex logical statements\n   - Consider adding it to a hints database if it's likely to be used frequently\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We need to correct the introduction of hypotheses. Since P, Q, and R are already in the context, we only need to introduce H for (P /\\ Q -> R).\n\n2. After introducing H, we should introduce hypotheses for P and Q as assumptions for the implication we're proving.\n\n3. To prove R, we can apply the hypothesis H to (P /\\ Q), which we can construct from our assumptions p and q.\n\n4. This approach will complete the left-to-right direction of the bi-implication.\n\n5. For the right-to-left direction, we'll need to introduce a hypothesis for (P -> Q -> R) and then prove (P /\\ Q -> R).\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these steps, using appropriate tactics to implement this reasoning.\n",
