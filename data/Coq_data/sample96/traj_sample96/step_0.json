    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves two universal quantifiers (X and Y) and a predicate P.\n   - The goal is to prove that if P holds for all x and y, it also holds for all y and x.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   - Use introduction tactics to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n   - Apply the given hypothesis with appropriate arguments.\n   - Show that this satisfies the goal.\n\n3. Detailed proof plan:\n   a. Introduce the types X and Y, the predicate P, and the hypothesis H.\n   b. Introduce arbitrary y and x.\n   c. Apply the hypothesis H to x and y.\n   d. The goal should be automatically solved as it matches the result of applying H.\n\n4. Potential tactics to use:\n   - intros: to introduce variables and hypotheses into the context\n   - apply: to apply the given hypothesis\n   - auto: to attempt automatic proof completion\n\n5. Considerations:\n   - The proof is straightforward and doesn't require any complex reasoning.\n   - The key insight is recognizing that the order of quantifiers can be swapped.\n   - No additional lemmas or theorems are needed for this proof.\n\n6. Reflection points:\n   - This theorem demonstrates the commutativity of universal quantifiers.\n   - It shows that the order of quantification doesn't matter when all variables are universally quantified.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the first steps of our proof plan. The theorem statement involves universal quantifiers and a predicate, so we need to introduce these elements into our context.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should begin by introducing the types X and Y, the predicate P, and the hypothesis that states the initial condition (forall x y, P x y).\n\n2. The introduction of these elements will allow us to work with concrete instances and apply our hypothesis in the next steps.\n\n3. Using the 'intros' tactic will bring these elements into our proof context, making them available for further manipulation.\n\n4. After introduction, we'll have a clearer view of our goal in the context of these introduced elements, which will guide our next steps in the proof.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the 'intros' tactic to bring X, Y, P, and the hypothesis into the proof context. This will set up the proof environment for the subsequent steps where we'll introduce specific instances of x and y and apply our hypothesis.\n",
