Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplying any natural number n by 1 (represented as S O) on the right side equals n.\n   - We have definitions for nat, add, and mul.\n   - We can use the admitted theorems mul_comm and mul_1_l.\n\n2. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a) Start with induction on n, as we're dealing with natural numbers.\n   b) Use the commutativity of multiplication (mul_comm) to convert mul n (S O) to mul (S O) n.\n   c) Apply the already proven mul_1_l theorem to complete the proof.\n\n3. Detailed Steps:\n   a) Induction on n:\n      - Base case: Prove for n = O\n      - Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for S n\n   b) For each case:\n      - Rewrite using mul_comm to get mul (S O) n\n      - Apply mul_1_l to simplify mul (S O) n to n\n   c) Conclude the proof\n\n4. Potential Challenges:\n   - Correctly applying the induction principle\n   - Proper use of rewrite and apply tactics with mul_comm and mul_1_l\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases (O and S n) are covered in the induction\n\nThis plan leverages the admitted theorems to simplify the proof, making it more straightforward and efficient.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mul_1_r, which states that for all natural numbers n, mul n (S O) = n, we should follow these logical steps:\n\n1. Begin with induction on n, as suggested in the planning strategy. This is because we're dealing with natural numbers, and induction is a powerful technique for proving properties that hold for all natural numbers.\n\n2. For the base case (n = O), we need to prove that mul O (S O) = O. This should be straightforward using the definition of mul.\n\n3. For the inductive step, we assume the property holds for some k (IH: mul k (S O) = k) and need to prove it for S k.\n\n4. To prove the inductive step, we can use the commutativity of multiplication (mul_comm) and the already proven theorem mul_1_l. This approach aligns with the planning strategy and allows us to leverage existing theorems.\n\n5. After applying mul_comm and mul_1_l, we should be able to simplify the expression and complete the proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by introducing the induction principle on n. This will set up the structure for both the base case and the inductive step, allowing us to prove the theorem for all natural numbers.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because the application of mul_1_l was incorrect and did not match the goal structure.\n\nImprovement: We should rewrite the goal using mul_1_l instead of applying it directly, and then use the induction hypothesis to complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that our approach was generally correct, but we encountered an issue in the final step of the inductive case. Let's break down the problem and suggest improvements:\n\n1. The induction and base case were handled correctly.\n2. In the inductive step, we successfully used simpl and rewrote with the induction hypothesis (IHk).\n3. We correctly applied the mul_comm theorem.\n4. The error occurred when trying to apply mul_1_l directly.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. After rewriting with mul_comm, we should rewrite with mul_1_l instead of applying it. This will simplify the left side of the equation.\n2. After rewriting with mul_1_l, the goal should become S (mul k (S O)) = S (mul k (S O)).\n3. At this point, we can use reflexivity to complete the proof.\n\nFor the next iteration, the acting agent should modify the last steps of the proof as follows:\n\n```coq\nrewrite mul_comm.\nrewrite mul_1_l.\nreflexivity.\n```\n\nThis approach should successfully complete the proof without using 'Admitted', aligning with our goal of rigorously proving the theorem.",
