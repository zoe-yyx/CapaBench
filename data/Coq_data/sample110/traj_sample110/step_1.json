    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem mul_1_r:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplying any natural number n by 1 (represented as S O) on the right side equals n.\n   - We have definitions for nat, add, and mul.\n   - We can use the admitted theorems mul_comm and mul_1_l.\n\n2. Outline the Proof Strategy:\n   a) Start with induction on n, as we're dealing with natural numbers.\n   b) Use the commutativity of multiplication (mul_comm) to convert mul n (S O) to mul (S O) n.\n   c) Apply the already proven mul_1_l theorem to complete the proof.\n\n3. Detailed Steps:\n   a) Induction on n:\n      - Base case: Prove for n = O\n      - Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for S n\n   b) For each case:\n      - Rewrite using mul_comm to get mul (S O) n\n      - Apply mul_1_l to simplify mul (S O) n to n\n   c) Conclude the proof\n\n4. Potential Challenges:\n   - Correctly applying the induction principle\n   - Proper use of rewrite and apply tactics with mul_comm and mul_1_l\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases (O and S n) are covered in the induction\n\nThis plan leverages the admitted theorems to simplify the proof, making it more straightforward and efficient.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof strategy has been mostly correct, but we encountered an issue in the final step of the inductive case. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've successfully completed the base case and most of the inductive step.\n2. In the inductive step, we've properly used simpl, rewritten with the induction hypothesis (IHk), and applied the mul_comm theorem.\n3. The error occurred when trying to apply mul_1_l directly, which didn't match the goal structure.\n\nTo correct this and complete the proof:\n\n1. Instead of applying mul_1_l, we should rewrite with it. This will simplify the left side of the equation.\n2. After rewriting with mul_1_l, the goal should become S (mul k (S O)) = S (mul k (S O)).\n3. At this point, we can use reflexivity to complete the proof.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should replace the last line \"apply mul_1_l.\" with:\n\nrewrite mul_1_l.\nreflexivity.\n\nThis sequence of tactics should successfully complete the proof, demonstrating that for all natural numbers n, mul n (S O) = n, which is the statement of the mul_1_r theorem.\n",
