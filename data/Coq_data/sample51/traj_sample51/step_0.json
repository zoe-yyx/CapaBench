Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The theorem 'proj2' is about logical conjunction (P /\\ Q)\n   - It states that if P /\\ Q is true, then Q is true\n   - This is essentially the second projection of a conjunction\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intros to bring the hypotheses into the context\n   - Use destruct to break down the conjunction\n   - Use the resulting hypothesis to prove the goal\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Introduce P, Q, and the hypothesis (P /\\ Q)\n   b. Destruct the conjunction hypothesis\n   c. Use the resulting Q hypothesis to prove the goal\n\n4. Consider potential tactics:\n   - intros for introducing hypotheses\n   - destruct for breaking down the conjunction\n   - exact for using the resulting hypothesis to prove the goal\n\n5. Reflect on the simplicity of the proof:\n   - This is a fundamental logical property\n   - The proof should be straightforward and concise\n   - No advanced tactics or complex reasoning should be necessary\n\n6. Prepare for potential variations:\n   - Be ready to adjust the proof if the exact statement of the theorem changes\n   - Consider how this proof might be used in more complex theorems later\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the theorem statement and our planning strategy, we should start by introducing the variables and hypothesis into our context. The theorem proj2 is about logical conjunction, stating that if P /\\ Q is true, then Q is true.\n\nOur first step should be to use the 'intros' tactic to bring P, Q, and the hypothesis (P /\\ Q) into the context. This will set up our proof environment with all the necessary components.\n\nAfter introducing these elements, we'll be in a position to break down the conjunction using the 'destruct' tactic. This will give us separate hypotheses for P and Q.\n\nOnce we have Q as a separate hypothesis, we can directly use it to prove our goal, as the goal is simply Q.\n\nTherefore, I recommend starting with the 'intros' tactic to set up our proof environment. This will allow us to see the hypotheses in our context and prepare for the next steps of the proof.\n",
