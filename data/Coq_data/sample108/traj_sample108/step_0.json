Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: forall n m p, mul n (mul m p) = mul (mul n m) p\n   - We need to prove the associativity of multiplication for natural numbers\n\n2. Identify Key Components:\n   - The definition of multiplication (mul) uses addition (add)\n   - We have an admitted theorem mul_add_distr_r which might be useful\n\n3. Choose Proof Strategy:\n   - Induction on n seems appropriate, as mul is defined recursively on its first argument\n\n4. Outline Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with induction on n\n   b. Base case (n = O):\n      - Simplify using the definition of mul\n   c. Inductive step (n = S n'):\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use the definition of mul\n      - Utilize mul_add_distr_r to rearrange terms\n      - Simplify and rewrite as needed\n\n5.

Tactics to Consider:\n   - induction n\n   - simpl\n   - rewrite (for mul_add_distr_r and induction hypothesis)\n   - reflexivity (for base case and final step)\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases (base and inductive) are properly addressed\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of multiplication, leveraging the given definitions and the admitted distributivity theorem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem mul_assoc, which states the associativity of multiplication for natural numbers, we should follow the outlined plan. The first step is to start with induction on n, as suggested in the planning strategy. This approach is appropriate because the mul function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\nReasoning for the next action:\n\n1. We should begin by applying induction on n. This will set up our proof structure with two cases: the base case (n = O) and the inductive step (n = S n').\n\n2. Starting with induction will allow us to prove the theorem for all natural numbers n, as it covers both the zero case and the successor case.\n\n3. After applying induction, we'll be presented with two subgoals:\n   - The base case, where we need to prove the theorem for n = O\n   - The inductive step, where we assume the theorem holds for n' and prove it for S n'\n\n4. This inductive approach aligns with the recursive definition of mul and will enable us to use the induction hypothesis in the second case.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should begin the proof by applying induction on n. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof and allow us to proceed with the base case and inductive step as outlined in the plan.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete due to an incorrect application of the induction hypothesis and failure to use it effectively in the inductive step.\n\nImprovement: We should rewrite the induction hypothesis (IHn') on the right side of the equation before applying mul_add_distr_r, and then use additional lemmas or properties of addition and multiplication to complete the proof.\n```\n\nReflection:\n\nThe current proof attempt for mul_assoc is incomplete and contains some errors. Let's analyze the issues and propose improvements:\n\n1. The base case (n = O) was correctly proved using simplification and reflexivity.\n\n2. In the inductive step, we encountered problems:\n   - The attempt to rewrite using the induction hypothesis (IHn') failed because it was applied in the wrong direction.\n   - After applying mul_add_distr_r, we were left with an equality that couldn't be solved by reflexivity alone.\n\n3. To improve the proof, we should:\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis (IHn') correctly by rewriting it on the right side of the equation.\n   - Use additional properties of multiplication and addition, such as the distributive property we proved earlier (mul_add_distr_r).\n   - Consider introducing and proving auxiliary lemmas if needed to bridge the gap in our reasoning.\n\n4. The overall structure of the proof (induction on n) is correct, but we need to be more careful in our manipulation of the equations and use of available theorems.\n\n5. We didn't use 'Admitted' in this proof attempt, which is good. We should continue to avoid it and focus on completing the proof rigorously.\n\nFor the next steps, the reasoning and acting agents should focus on correctly applying the induction hypothesis, using the distributive property of multiplication over addition (mul_add_distr_r) more effectively, and possibly introducing additional steps or lemmas to connect the left and right sides of the equation in the inductive step. This may involve breaking down the proof into smaller, more manageable steps and using rewrite tactics more precisely.",
