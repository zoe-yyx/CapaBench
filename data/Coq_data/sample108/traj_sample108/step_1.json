    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for Theorem mul_assoc:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: forall n m p, mul n (mul m p) = mul (mul n m) p\n   - We need to prove the associativity of multiplication for natural numbers\n\n2. Identify Key Components:\n   - The definition of multiplication (mul) uses addition (add)\n   - We have an admitted theorem mul_add_distr_r which might be useful\n\n3. Choose Proof Strategy:\n   - Induction on n seems appropriate, as mul is defined recursively on its first argument\n\n4. Outline Proof Steps:\n   a. Start with induction on n\n   b. Base case (n = O):\n      - Simplify using the definition of mul\n   c. Inductive step (n = S n'):\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use the definition of mul\n      - Utilize mul_add_distr_r to rearrange terms\n      - Simplify and rewrite as needed\n\n5. Potential Challenges:\n   - Proper application of mul_add_distr_r might require some intermediate steps\n   - Careful management of parentheses and equality chains will be important\n\n6. Tactics to Consider:\n   - induction n\n   - simpl\n   - rewrite (for mul_add_distr_r and induction hypothesis)\n   - reflexivity (for base case and final step)\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases (base and inductive) are properly addressed\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of multiplication, leveraging the given definitions and the admitted distributivity theorem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. In the inductive step, we need to apply the induction hypothesis correctly. We should rewrite using IHn' on the right side of the equation.\n\n2. After applying IHn', we should use the distributive property (mul_add_distr_r) to rearrange terms on both sides of the equation.\n\n3. We may need to use the definition of mul for the case of S n' to expand terms further.\n\n4. The goal is to manipulate both sides of the equation until they match, possibly using properties of addition and multiplication.\n\n5. We should proceed step by step, using targeted rewrite tactics and possibly introducing intermediate equalities to bridge the gap between the left and right sides.\n\n6. If we encounter difficulties, we might need to prove additional lemmas about the properties of mul and add to assist in our main proof.\n\nThe key is to carefully transform the equation, keeping track of how each side evolves, until we can show they are equivalent. This may require multiple rewrite steps and clever use of the available definitions and theorems.\n",
