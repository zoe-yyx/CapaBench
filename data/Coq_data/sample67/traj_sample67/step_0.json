    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to set up the structure for proving the logical equivalence. The planning suggests using the 'iff' tactic to split the equivalence into two implications. This is a good starting point as it will allow us to tackle each direction of the proof separately.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should begin by introducing the propositions P and Q into our context. This will allow us to work with these propositions throughout the proof.\n\n2. After introducing P and Q, we should use the 'iff' tactic to split the equivalence into two separate implications. This aligns with our plan to prove each direction separately.\n\n3. Once the equivalence is split, we'll have two subgoals to prove:\n   a) ~ (P \\/ Q) -> ~ P /\\ ~ Q\n   b) ~ P /\\ ~ Q -> ~ (P \\/ Q)\n\n4. For each of these subgoals, we'll need to introduce the hypothesis on the left side of the implication.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following sequence of actions for the acting agent:\n\n1. Use the 'intros' tactic to bring P and Q into the context.\n2. Apply the 'iff' tactic to split the equivalence.\n3. For the resulting subgoals, use 'intros' again to bring the hypotheses into the context.\n\nThis will set up the proof structure and prepare us to tackle each direction of the equivalence separately, as outlined in the planning strategy.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The 'iff' tactic is not recognized in this version of Coq, leading to an error in the proof structure setup.\nImprovement: Replace the 'iff' tactic with 'apply iff_equiv' to split the equivalence, and then use 'split' to generate two subgoals for the bidirectional implication.\n```\n\nReflection:\n\nThe current approach encountered an issue when trying to use the 'iff' tactic, which is not recognized in this version of Coq. This prevented us from properly setting up the proof structure for the logical equivalence.\n\nTo improve our approach, we need to adjust our tactics:\n\n1. We correctly introduced P and Q into the context using 'intros P Q'.\n\n2. Instead of using 'iff', we should use 'apply iff_equiv' to transform the goal into an equivalent form that uses conjunction and implication.\n\n3. After applying 'iff_equiv', we should use the 'split' tactic to generate two subgoals, one for each direction of the implication.\n\n4. For each subgoal, we can then proceed with 'intros' to bring the hypothesis into the context.\n\nThe revised sequence of actions for the acting agent should be:\n\n1. intros P Q.\n2. apply iff_equiv.\n3. split.\n4. - intros H.\n5. - intros H.\n\nThis approach will properly set up the proof structure, allowing us to proceed with proving each direction of the equivalence separately. It aligns with our overall goal of proving the theorem rigorously without using 'Admitted'.\n\nIn future steps, we should be mindful of potential differences in tactic availability or syntax across different versions of Coq, and be prepared to adapt our approach accordingly.",
