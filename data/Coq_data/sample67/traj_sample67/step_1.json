Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'iff' tactic to split the equivalence into two implications\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. For the forward direction (->):\n   - Assume ~ (P \\/ Q)\n   - Prove ~ P /\\ ~ Q\n   - Use proof by contradiction for both ~ P and ~ Q\n   - Utilize the assumption ~ (P \\/ Q) to derive contradictions\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nThe initial attempt to use the 'iff' tactic failed because it's not recognized in this version of Coq. We need to restructure our approach to prove the logical equivalence. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have already introduced P and Q into the context with 'intros P Q', which is correct.\n\n2. To split the equivalence into two implications, we should use 'apply iff_equiv'. This will transform our goal into a conjunction of two implications.\n\n3. After applying 'iff_equiv', we should use the 'split' tactic. This will generate two subgoals, one for each direction of the implication.\n\n4. For the forward direction (->), we should introduce the hypothesis with 'intros H'. This H will represent ~ (P \\/ Q).\n\n5. For the backward direction (<-), we should also introduce the hypothesis with 'intros H'. This H will represent ~ P /\\ ~ Q.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof structure correctly, allowing us to proceed with proving each direction of the equivalence separately. \n\nThe acting agent should execute these tactics in sequence:\n1. apply iff_equiv.\n2. split.\n3. - intros H.\n4. - intros H.\n\nAfter these steps, we'll be in a position to start proving each direction of the equivalence using the introduced hypotheses.\n",
