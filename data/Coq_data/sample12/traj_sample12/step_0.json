    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that for any integer x, the square of x is non-negative.\n   - The theorem involves the `square` and `nonneg` definitions.\n\n2. Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definitions of `square` and `nonneg`.\n   - This will give us: forall x: Z, x * x >= 0\n\n3. Use Integer Properties:\n   - Recall that the product of any integer with itself is always non-negative.\n   - This is a fundamental property of integers that we can leverage.\n\n4. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Introduce the universal quantifier (forall x: Z).\n   b. Unfold the definitions of `square` and `nonneg`.\n   c. Use the lia tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) to solve the goal.\n      - lia is powerful for solving linear inequalities over integers.\n      - It should be able to handle x * x >= 0 automatically.\n\n5. Alternative Strategy (if lia fails):\n   a. If lia doesn't work, we may need to case split on whether x is positive, negative, or zero.\n   b. For each case, prove that x * x >= 0:\n      - For x > 0: x * x > 0\n      - For x < 0: (-x) * (-x) > 0\n      - For x = 0: 0 * 0 = 0 >= 0\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - Once the proof is complete, use Qed to finish.\n\nNote: Given the simplicity of this theorem and the power of the lia tactic, \nthe main strategy should work without needing the alternative approach. \nHowever, it's good to have a backup plan in case of unexpected complications.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nOur goal is to prove the theorem nonneg_square, which states that for all integers x, the square of x is non-negative. Let's follow the planned strategy:\n\n1. We should start by introducing the universal quantifier. This will bring the variable x into our context.\n\n2. After introducing x, we need to unfold the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'. This will transform our goal into a more concrete form: x * x >= 0.\n\n3. Once we have the simplified goal, we can use the lia tactic. This tactic is powerful for solving linear integer arithmetic problems, and the statement x * x >= 0 falls within its capabilities.\n\n4. If for some reason lia doesn't work (which is unlikely in this case), we would need to consider an alternative approach involving case analysis on x. However, we should try the simpler approach with lia first.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with the following steps:\n1. Introduce the universal quantifier for x.\n2. Unfold the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'.\n3. Apply the lia tactic to solve the resulting goal.\n\nThis approach should be sufficient to prove the theorem without needing to resort to more complex strategies.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the recent outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The lia tactic failed to solve the goal x * x >= 0, which was unexpected given the simplicity of the statement.\nImprovement: We should consider using a different tactic or breaking down the proof into smaller steps, possibly using the fact that any number squared is non-negative.\n```\n\nThe failure of the lia tactic is surprising, as it should be capable of handling this type of arithmetic inequality. This suggests that there might be an issue with how lia is interpreting the goal or with the tactic's implementation in the current Coq environment.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should consider the following steps:\n\n1. Try using other tactics that can handle arithmetic, such as omega or ring.\n2. If automated tactics fail, we might need to break down the proof manually:\n   - We could use case analysis on x (x < 0, x = 0, x > 0).\n   - For each case, we can prove that x * x >= 0 holds.\n3. We could also try to use more basic tactics to manipulate the inequality, such as:\n   - apply Z.square_nonneg (if such a lemma exists in the standard library)\n   - or prove a helper lemma stating that the square of any integer is non-negative\n\nFor the next attempt, I suggest starting with:\n\n1. Try the omega tactic instead of lia.\n2. If that fails, attempt to use ring or ring_simplify.\n3. If automated tactics continue to fail, proceed with a manual case analysis on x.\n\nThese steps should help us progress towards proving the theorem, even if the initially planned automated approach didn't succeed.",
