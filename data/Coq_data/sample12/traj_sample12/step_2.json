    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that for any integer x, the square of x is non-negative.\n   - The theorem involves the `square` and `nonneg` definitions.\n\n2. Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definitions of `square` and `nonneg`.\n   - This will give us: forall x: Z, x * x >= 0\n\n3. Use Integer Properties:\n   - Recall that the product of any integer with itself is always non-negative.\n   - This is a fundamental property of integers that we can leverage.\n\n4. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Introduce the universal quantifier (forall x: Z).\n   b. Unfold the definitions of `square` and `nonneg`.\n   c. Use the lia tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) to solve the goal.\n      - lia is powerful for solving linear inequalities over integers.\n      - It should be able to handle x * x >= 0 automatically.\n\n5. Alternative Strategy (if lia fails):\n   a. If lia doesn't work, we may need to case split on whether x is positive, negative, or zero.\n   b. For each case, prove that x * x >= 0:\n      - For x > 0: x * x > 0\n      - For x < 0: (-x) * (-x) > 0\n      - For x = 0: 0 * 0 = 0 >= 0\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - Once the proof is complete, use Qed to finish.\n\nNote: Given the simplicity of this theorem and the power of the lia tactic, \nthe main strategy should work without needing the alternative approach. \nHowever, it's good to have a backup plan in case of unexpected complications.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nLet's start the proof from the beginning with a more direct approach:\n\n1. Begin the proof and introduce the variable x.\n2. Unfold the definitions of nonneg and square.\n3. Try to solve the goal directly using the nia tactic, which is powerful for non-linear integer arithmetic.\n4. If nia doesn't solve it immediately, we'll proceed with a case analysis:\n   a. Use 'destruct (Z.compare_spec 0 x) as [Heq | Hlt | Hgt]' to consider all cases.\n   b. For the equality case (Heq: 0 = x), rewrite using Heq and solve with reflexivity.\n   c. For the less than case (Hlt: 0 < x), use 'apply Z.mul_nonneg_nonneg; nia'.\n   d. For the greater than case (Hgt: 0 > x), use 'apply Z.mul_nonneg_nonneg; nia'.\n5. After handling all cases, the proof should be complete.\n\nThis approach avoids the need for a separate helper lemma and should directly prove the theorem using built-in tactics and properties of integers.\n",
