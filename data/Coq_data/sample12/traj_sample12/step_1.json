    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that for any integer x, the square of x is non-negative.\n   - The theorem involves the `square` and `nonneg` definitions.\n\n2. Unfold Definitions:\n   - Start by unfolding the definitions of `square` and `nonneg`.\n   - This will give us: forall x: Z, x * x >= 0\n\n3. Use Integer Properties:\n   - Recall that the product of any integer with itself is always non-negative.\n   - This is a fundamental property of integers that we can leverage.\n\n4. Proof Strategy:\n   a. Introduce the universal quantifier (forall x: Z).\n   b. Unfold the definitions of `square` and `nonneg`.\n   c. Use the lia tactic (Linear Integer Arithmetic) to solve the goal.\n      - lia is powerful for solving linear inequalities over integers.\n      - It should be able to handle x * x >= 0 automatically.\n\n5. Alternative Strategy (if lia fails):\n   a. If lia doesn't work, we may need to case split on whether x is positive, negative, or zero.\n   b. For each case, prove that x * x >= 0:\n      - For x > 0: x * x > 0\n      - For x < 0: (-x) * (-x) > 0\n      - For x = 0: 0 * 0 = 0 >= 0\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - Once the proof is complete, use Qed to finish.\n\nNote: Given the simplicity of this theorem and the power of the lia tactic, \nthe main strategy should work without needing the alternative approach. \nHowever, it's good to have a backup plan in case of unexpected complications.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that the lia tactic unexpectedly failed to solve our goal x * x >= 0, we need to adjust our approach. The fact that this simple arithmetic inequality wasn't automatically solved suggests we might need to break down the proof into more basic steps or use alternative tactics. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. First, we should try other automated tactics that are good at handling arithmetic inequalities. The omega tactic, while older than lia, might be able to handle this case. If omega is not available or doesn't work, we can try ring or ring_simplify, which are particularly good at dealing with polynomial expressions.\n\n2. If these automated tactics also fail, we should resort to a more manual approach. We can break down the proof by considering the possible cases for x:\n   - x > 0\n   - x = 0\n   - x < 0\n\n3. For each case, we can prove that x * x >= 0 holds:\n   - When x > 0, x * x > 0 is obvious\n   - When x = 0, 0 * 0 = 0 >= 0\n   - When x < 0, we can use the fact that a negative number multiplied by itself is positive\n\n4. If we need to prove these basic facts, we might use tactics like assert, rewrite, or apply in combination with existing lemmas about integer arithmetic.\n\n5. As a last resort, if no existing lemmas seem to help, we might need to prove a helper lemma stating that the square of any integer is non-negative, and then use this lemma in our main proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I suggest we start by trying the omega tactic. If that doesn't work, we should move on to ring or ring_simplify. If automated tactics continue to fail, we should proceed with the manual case analysis approach.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to incorrect tactics and incomplete case analysis, particularly in handling the equality case and applying the asserted helper lemma.\n\nImprovement: We should refine our approach by using nia instead of the unavailable omega tactic, completing the case analysis properly, and ensuring the helper lemma is correctly applied to solve the main goal.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the reflection:\n\n1. The omega tactic is not available in this version of Coq, which caused an error. We should use nia (non-linear integer arithmetic) instead, which is a more powerful tactic that can handle such inequalities.\n\n2. The case analysis was incomplete and contained errors. In the equality case (Heq : 0 = a), the reflexivity tactic was inappropriate for proving an inequality.\n\n3. The assertion of the helper lemma (H: forall a : Z, a * a >= 0) was correct, but its proof was incomplete, and it wasn't properly applied to solve the main goal.\n\n4. The ring_simplify tactic changed x * x to x ^ 2, which is fine, but we need to ensure our proof works with this new form.\n\nFor the next steps, I suggest:\n\n1. Start the proof fresh, using unfold and nia to attempt a direct solution.\n2. If nia doesn't solve it directly, proceed with the case analysis, but ensure each case is properly handled:\n   - For the equality case, use rewrite and reflexivity.\n   - For the inequality cases, use Z.mul_nonneg_nonneg and nia.\n3. After completing the helper lemma proof, apply it to the main goal and finish the proof.\n\nThis approach should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.",
