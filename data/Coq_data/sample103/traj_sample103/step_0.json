Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplying any natural number by 0 on the right always results in 0.\n   - We need to show: forall n, mul n O = O\n\n2. Analyze the definitions:\n   - Review the definition of mul, which is defined recursively.\n   - Note that mul uses add in its recursive step.\n\n3. Choose the proof method:\n   - Use induction on n, as mul is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n4. Outline the proof structure:\n   a. Base case: Prove for n = O\n   b. Inductive step: Assume it's true for n, prove for S n\n\n5. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Base case (n = O):\n      - Simplify mul O O using the definition of mul\n      - Show that this equals O\n\n   b. Inductive step:\n      - Assume the inductive hypothesis: mul n O = O\n      - Goal: Prove mul (S n) O = O\n      - Simplify mul (S n) O using the definition of mul\n      - Use the definition of add\n      - Apply the inductive hypothesis\n\n6.

Key tactics to consider:\n   - induction n\n   - simpl\n   - rewrite (for applying the inductive hypothesis)\n   - reflexivity\n\n8. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly unfolding and simplifying the definitions of mul and add\n   - Correctly applying the inductive hypothesis\n\n9. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that all cases are covered (O and S n)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof, our first step should be to initiate the induction on n as outlined in the planning strategy. This is because the mul function is defined recursively on its first argument, and induction is the most appropriate method to prove properties of recursive functions over natural numbers.\n\nThe induction tactic will generate two subgoals:\n\n1. The base case: mul O O = O\n2. The inductive step: Assuming mul n O = O, prove mul (S n) O = O\n\nFor the base case, we'll need to simplify the expression mul O O using the definition of mul. This should directly give us O, which can be solved easily.\n\nFor the inductive step, we'll need to:\na) Simplify mul (S n) O using the definition of mul\nb) This will likely result in an expression involving add\nc) We'll then need to use the inductive hypothesis to complete the proof\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n. This will set up the structure for the entire proof and allow us to tackle each case separately.\n",
