    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that \"not (P implies Q)\" is equivalent to \"P and not Q\".\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (iff), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Break down the proof into two parts:\n   a. Left to right: ~ (P -> Q) -> P /\\ ~ Q\n   b. Right to left: P /\\ ~ Q -> ~ (P -> Q)\n\n3. For the left to right direction:\n   - Start with the hypothesis ~ (P -> Q)\n   - Use classical logic (law of excluded middle) to consider cases for P and Q\n   - Show that P must be true and Q must be false\n   - Combine these to form P /\\ ~ Q\n\n4. For the right to left direction:\n   - Start with the hypothesis P /\\ ~ Q\n   - Assume P -> Q for contradiction\n   - Use the facts that P is true and P -> Q to deduce Q\n   - Show that this contradicts ~ Q from the hypothesis\n   - Conclude ~ (P -> Q)\n\n5. Combine both directions to complete the iff proof\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - intros: to introduce the propositions P and Q\n   - split: to separate the iff into two implications\n   - unfold not: to expand the definition of negation\n   - destruct: for case analysis\n   - apply: to use hypotheses or previously proven facts\n   - contradiction: to derive a contradiction\n   - tauto: for propositional tautologies (if needed)\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling double negations\n   - Correctly applying classical logic principles\n   - Ensuring all cases are covered in the proof\n\n8. Final steps:\n   - Review the proof for completeness\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are used and discharged\n   - Verify that the proof aligns with the theorem statement\n",
