    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to introduce the universally quantified variable 'x'. This aligns with step 3a of our plan.\n\nAfter introducing 'x', we should unfold the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'plus_one'. This will allow us to work directly with the underlying expressions and is in line with step 3b of our plan.\n\nOnce the definitions are unfolded, we'll have an equation involving basic arithmetic operations on Z (integers). At this point, we can use simplification to reduce the expression, following step 3c.\n\nFinally, we should be able to prove the equality using the 'ring' tactic, which is powerful for dealing with ring-like structures such as integers. This corresponds to step 3d of our plan.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following sequence of tactics:\n\n1. intros x\n2. unfold shift_left1, plus_one\n3. simpl\n4. ring\n\nThis sequence should lead us directly to the proof of the theorem. If any unexpected goals or side conditions arise, we may need to adjust our approach, but this straightforward path seems most likely to succeed based on the problem description and our planning.\n",
