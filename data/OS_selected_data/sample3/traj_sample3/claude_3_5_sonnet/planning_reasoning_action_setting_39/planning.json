Remove the 'devgroup' group:\n   - Use the 'groupdel' command to delete the group\n\n3. Verify the group has been removed:\n   - Use the 'getent' command again to confirm the group no longer exists\n   - Check the /etc/group file to ensure the group is not listed\n\n4. Handle any potential errors:\n   - Be prepared to address issues such as the group being in use by users or processes\n```\n\nThis plan covers all necessary steps to remove the 'devgroup' and verify its removal from the system.
