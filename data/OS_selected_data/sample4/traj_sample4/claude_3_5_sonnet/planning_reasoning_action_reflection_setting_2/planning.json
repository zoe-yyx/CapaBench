Check the current Linux kernel version using the appropriate command.\n2. Create a text file named 'kernel_version.txt' in the home directory.\n3. Redirect the output of the kernel version command into the newly created file.\n4. Verify that the file has been created and contains the correct information.\n```\n\nThis plan covers all the necessary steps to complete the task efficiently. Let's break down the reasoning behind each step:\n\n1. Checking the kernel version: We need to use a command that displays the current Linux kernel version. The most common command for this is 'uname -r'.\n\n2. Creating the text file: We'll need to create a new file in the home directory. The tilde (~) represents the home directory in Linux.\n\n3. Redirecting the output: Instead of manually copying the kernel version, we can directly redirect the output of the 'uname -r' command into the file we created.\n\n4. Verification: It's always good practice to verify that our actions have been completed successfully. We'll check if the file exists and contains the correct information.\n\nThis plan ensures that we complete the task accurately and efficiently, following a logical sequence of steps."
