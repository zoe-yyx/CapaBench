Change the priority of the process\n   - Use the `renice` command with sudo to set the nice value to 10\n\n4. Verify the change\n   - Use the `ps` command again to confirm the new nice value\n```\n\nThis plan covers all necessary steps to complete the task efficiently and provides a way to verify that the change has been made successfully."
