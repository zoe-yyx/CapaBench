Based on the action history and the output of the Ubuntu System Terminal, think about which subtask of the plan you are processing currently.\nIf you think the task is completed, you can just output 'The task is completed' in your reasoning output.\nOtherwise, based on the current stage, think how to use terminal commands to interact with the Ubuntu terminal to solve the task efficiently. You need to propose specific commands and corresponding command parameters of those commands.\n\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning (your summary must contain all key information) and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:\n"
