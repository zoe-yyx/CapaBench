Navigate to the parent directory of 'documents'\n2. List contents to confirm 'documents' directory exists\n3. List .doc files in the 'documents' directory\n4. Create 'archive_document.zip' with all .doc files from 'documents'\n5. Verify the contents of the created zip file.\n\n[History Interaction Information]\nYour past history interaction information is: \n[].\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the output of the Ubuntu System Terminal, think about which subtask of the plan you are processing currently.\nIf you think the task is completed, you can just output 'The task is completed' in your reasoning output.\nOtherwise, based on the current stage, think how to use terminal commands to interact with the Ubuntu terminal to solve the task efficiently. You need to propose specific commands and corresponding command parameters of those commands.\n\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning (your summary must contain all key information) and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:\n"

We need to verify if the 'documents' directory exists.\n3. If it exists, we'll list the .doc files in the 'documents' directory.\n4. Then, we'll create the zip file with all .doc files.\n5.

Bash Action\nIf the reasoning tells that you should use some terminal commands to execute some bash code, take bash action. Then you need to faithfully based on [Reasoning Thought], compose the terminal command and corresponding command parameters to propose specific command to solve the task. You should print like this:\n\nAct: bash\n\n```bash\n# put your bash code here\n```\n\n2. Finish Action\nIf the [Reasoning Thought] think the task is completed, for example, it tells 'The task is completed'. That means you have finished the task, no more action is needed, just take finish action, thus you should print like this:\n\nAct: finish\n\n\n\nYou need to faithfully based on the [Reasoning Thought], according to the [Action Options and Action Output Instruction] to choose either Bash Action or Finish Action.
