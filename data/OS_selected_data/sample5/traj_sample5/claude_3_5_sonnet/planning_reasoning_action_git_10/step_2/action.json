You can interact with the git tree through a terminal by git commands.\nTo solve the task, you must understand the [Reasoning Thought] and faithfully follow the guidance of [Reasoning Thought] to propose specific git commands to proceed the task.\n\n[Reasoning Thought]\nThe current state of git tree is: {'branches': {'main': {'target': 'C5', 'id': 'main', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}, 'side': {'target': 'C3', 'id': 'side', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}}, 'commits': {'C0': {'parents': [], 'id': 'C0', 'rootCommit': True}, 'C1': {'parents': ['C0'], 'id': 'C1'}, 'C2': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C2'}, 'C3': {'parents': ['C2'], 'id': 'C3'}, 'C4': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C4'}, 'C5': {'parents': ['C2', 'C4'], 'id': 'C5'}}, 'tags': {'v0': {'target': 'C1', 'id': 'v0'}, 'v1': {'target': 'C2', 'id': 'v1'}}, 'HEAD': {'target': 'main', 'id': 'HEAD'}}.\nYour analysis about the current state and how to solve the task is:\nThe first two steps of the plan (creating tags v0 and v1) have been completed. The final step is to move HEAD to commit C2. This can be achieved by using the git checkout command to directly checkout commit C2, which will detach HEAD and point it to C2 as required in the target state..\n\n\n[Action Options and Action Output Instruction]\nMost common git commands are available.\nA special case is there's no need to use git add command for there's no concept of adding / staging files.\n\nYou should analyze which git command and the parameters of the git command from [Reasoning Thought].\nOnce you determine the git command, you should output the git command in the following format:\n```command\n# put your git command here\n```\n\nAn example is like this:\n```command\ngit commit\n```\n\nYou need to faithfully based on the [Reasoning Thought], according to the [Action Options and Action Output Instruction] to generate the next git command.\n\nNow, your action is:",
