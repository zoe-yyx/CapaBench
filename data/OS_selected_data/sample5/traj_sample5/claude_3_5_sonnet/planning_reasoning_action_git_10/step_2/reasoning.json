    "ReasoningPrompt": "\nYou are a git agent to complete a git task. As you know, if we consider every commit in git as a child node of the parent commit, the git tree is in a tree structure. You can interact with the git tree through a terminal by git commands.\n\n[Task Description]\nThe whole git task you need to solve is to change the init git tree to the target git tree, while after your past interaction, the git tree is currently in the state of current git tree.\nThe init git tree is:\n{'branches': {'main': {'target': 'C5', 'id': 'main', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}, 'side': {'target': 'C3', 'id': 'side', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}}, 'commits': {'C0': {'parents': [], 'id': 'C0', 'rootCommit': True}, 'C1': {'parents': ['C0'], 'id': 'C1'}, 'C2': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C2'}, 'C3': {'parents': ['C2'], 'id': 'C3'}, 'C4': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C4'}, 'C5': {'parents': ['C2', 'C4'], 'id': 'C5'}}, 'tags': {}, 'HEAD': {'target': 'main', 'id': 'HEAD'}}.\n\nThe target git tree is:\n{'branches': {'main': {'target': 'C5', 'id': 'main', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}, 'side': {'target': 'C3', 'id': 'side', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}}, 'commits': {'C0': {'parents': [], 'id': 'C0', 'rootCommit': True}, 'C1': {'parents': ['C0'], 'id': 'C1'}, 'C2': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C2'}, 'C3': {'parents': ['C2'], 'id': 'C3'}, 'C4': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C4'}, 'C5': {'parents': ['C2', 'C4'], 'id': 'C5'}}, 'tags': {'v1': {'target': 'C2', 'id': 'v1', 'type': 'tag'}, 'v0': {'target': 'C1', 'id': 'v0', 'type': 'tag'}}, 'HEAD': {'target': 'C2', 'id': 'HEAD'}}.\n\nThe current git tree is:\n{'branches': {'main': {'target': 'C5', 'id': 'main', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}, 'side': {'target': 'C3', 'id': 'side', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}}, 'commits': {'C0': {'parents': [], 'id': 'C0', 'rootCommit': True}, 'C1': {'parents': ['C0'], 'id': 'C1'}, 'C2': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C2'}, 'C3': {'parents': ['C2'], 'id': 'C3'}, 'C4': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C4'}, 'C5': {'parents': ['C2', 'C4'], 'id': 'C5'}}, 'tags': {'v0': {'target': 'C1', 'id': 'v0'}, 'v1': {'target': 'C2', 'id': 'v1'}}, 'HEAD': {'target': 'main', 'id': 'HEAD'}}.\n\n[Proposed Plan]\nAn abstract plan on how to complete the git task is:\n1. Create tag 'v0' pointing to commit C1\n2. Create tag 'v1' pointing to commit C2\n3. Move HEAD to commit C2.\n\n[History Interaction Information]\nYour past history interaction information with the git tree is:\n['git tag v0 C1', 'git tag v1 C2'].\n\nThe proposed plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the history interaction information and the current git tree state, think about which subtask of the plan you are processing currently.\n\nBased on the current stage, think how to use git commands to change the current git tree to the target git tree efficiently. You need to propose specific git commands to complete the subtask.\n\n\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning(your summary must contain all key information) and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\n\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:\n",
    "ReasoningResponse": "Based on the provided information, let's analyze the current state and determine the next steps:\n\n1. We've already completed the first two steps of the proposed plan:\n   - Tag 'v0' has been created pointing to commit C1\n   - Tag 'v1' has been created pointing to commit C2\n\n2. The current git tree shows that HEAD is pointing to the 'main' branch, which is at commit C5.\n\n3. The target git tree shows that HEAD should be pointing directly to commit C2.\n\n4. The only remaining step from the proposed plan is to move HEAD to commit C2.\n\nTherefore, we need to checkout commit C2 directly, which will detach HEAD and point it to C2 as required in the target state.\n\n```reasoning\nThe first two steps of the plan (creating tags v0 and v1) have been completed. The final step is to move HEAD to commit C2. This can be achieved by using the git checkout command to directly checkout commit C2, which will detach HEAD and point it to C2 as required in the target state.\n```\n\nThe git command to complete this task would be:\n\ngit checkout C2\n\nThis command will move HEAD to point directly at commit C2, matching the target git tree state.",
