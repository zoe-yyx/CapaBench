    "ActionPrompt": "\nYou are a git agent to complete a git task. As you know, if we consider every commit in git as a child node of the parent commit, the git tree is in a tree structure. You can interact with the git tree through a terminal by git commands.\nTo solve the task, you must understand the [Reasoning Thought] and faithfully follow the guidance of [Reasoning Thought] to propose specific git commands to proceed the task.\n\n[Reasoning Thought]\nThe current state of git tree is: {'branches': {'main': {'target': 'C5', 'id': 'main', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}, 'side': {'target': 'C3', 'id': 'side', 'remoteTrackingBranchID': None}}, 'commits': {'C0': {'parents': [], 'id': 'C0', 'rootCommit': True}, 'C1': {'parents': ['C0'], 'id': 'C1'}, 'C2': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C2'}, 'C3': {'parents': ['C2'], 'id': 'C3'}, 'C4': {'parents': ['C1'], 'id': 'C4'}, 'C5': {'parents': ['C2', 'C4'], 'id': 'C5'}}, 'tags': {}, 'HEAD': {'target': 'main', 'id': 'HEAD'}}.\nYour analysis about the current state and how to solve the task is:\nTo complete the task of changing the current git tree to the target git tree, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create tag 'v0' pointing to commit C1:\n   We can use the command `git tag v0 C1` to create this tag.\n\n2. Create tag 'v1' pointing to commit C2:\n   Similarly, we can use `git tag v1 C2` to create this tag.\n\n3. Move HEAD to commit C2:\n   We can use `git checkout C2` to move HEAD to commit C2.\n\nThese commands will efficiently transform the current git tree to match the target git tree. The tags 'v0' and 'v1' will be created pointing to the correct commits, and HEAD will be moved to C2 as specified in the target tree.\n\nSince there's no history of previous interactions, we'll start from the beginning of the plan. These commands should be executed in order to achieve the desired result..\n\n\n[Action Options and Action Output Instruction]\nMost common git commands are available.\nA special case is there's no need to use git add command for there's no concept of adding / staging files.\n\nYou should analyze which git command and the parameters of the git command from [Reasoning Thought].\nOnce you determine the git command, you should output the git command in the following format:\n```command\n# put your git command here\n```\n\nAn example is like this:\n```command\ngit commit\n```\n\nYou need to faithfully based on the [Reasoning Thought], according to the [Action Options and Action Output Instruction] to generate the next git command.\n\nNow, your action is:",
    "action": "Based on the [Reasoning Thought], the first step is to create the tag 'v0' pointing to commit C1. Following the [Action Options and Action Output Instruction], I will output the appropriate git command:\n\n```command\ngit tag v0 C1\n```\n\nThis command will create a new tag named 'v0' that points to commit C1, as specified in the reasoning.",
