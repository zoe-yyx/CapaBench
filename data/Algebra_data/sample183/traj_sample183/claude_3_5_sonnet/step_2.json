    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the quadratic equation formula and its components:\n   - General form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   - Given: a = 2, b = 5, c = k\n\n2. Remember the discriminant formula for a quadratic equation:\n   - Discriminant = b^2 - 4ac\n   - We're told the discriminant equals 1\n\n3. Create an equation using the discriminant information:\n   - b^2 - 4ac = 1\n\n4. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n   - 5^2 - 4(2)(k) = 1\n\n5. Solve the equation for k:\n   - Simplify the left side of the equation\n   - Isolate k\n   - Perform necessary calculations\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of k back into the original equation\n   - Check if the discriminant equals 1\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of k that satisfies the given conditions\n\nThis plan should lead to solving the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations and the quadratic formula concepts.\n",

We have simplified our equation to: 25 - 8k = 1\n\n2. To isolate k, we need to:\n   a) Subtract 25 from both sides of the equation\n   b) Divide both sides by -8\n\n3. Let's start with subtracting 25 from both sides:\n   25 - 8k = 1\n   -8k = 1 - 25\n   -8k = -24\n\n4. Now we need to divide both sides by -8:\n   -8k = -24\n   k = -24 / (-8)\n\n5. To find the final value of k, we need to perform this division.\n\nThe next logical step is to use the calculator to divide -24 by -8. This will give us the value of k that satisfies the original condition where the discriminant equals 1.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have solved for k and can proceed to verify our solution by substituting it back into the original quadratic equation to check if the discriminant indeed equals 1.\n",
