Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.\n\nNote: When entering a square root with more than one character, you must use parentheses or brackets.

    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Evaluating $\\sqrt{125x} \\cdot \\sqrt{20x} \\cdot \\sqrt{45x}$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: We need to multiply three square roots and simplify the result.\n\n2. Analyze the components:\n   - Look at each term under the square roots: 125x, 20x, and 45x\n   - Notice that x is common in all terms\n\n3. Simplify under the radicals:\n   - Factor out the common x from each term\n   - Simplify the remaining numbers if possible\n\n4. Multiply the radicals:\n   - Use the property of multiplying radicals: $\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}$\n   - Multiply the terms under the radicals\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Factor the number under the final radical\n   - Separate perfect square factors from non-perfect square factors\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the simplified radical form\n   - Ensure x is expressed to the correct power\n\n7. Double-check the result:\n   - Verify that no further simplification is possible\n   - Confirm that the answer is in the simplest radical form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and properties of radicals that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the results we've obtained, let's reason about our solution and next steps:\n\n1. We've confirmed that \u221a112500 \u2248 335.410196624968, which matches our simplified form 150\u221a5.\n\n2. We've attempted to verify our simplification by calculating (150 * \u221a5)^2, but the calculator result is in an unexpected format: 22500.0*q**2*r**2*s**2*t(5)**2. This suggests we may need to use a different calculation method or interpret this result.\n\n3. Despite this unexpected result, our simplification of \u221a112500 to 150\u221a5 is correct because:\n   150^2 * 5 = 22500 * 5 = 112500\n\n4. Our final expression 150x\u221a(5x) is derived correctly:\n   - The numerical part is 150\u221a5\n   - The x terms: (\u221ax)^3 = x\u221ax\n   - Combining these: 150\u221a5 * x\u221ax = 150x\u221a(5x)\n\n5. To verify if this is the simplest form, we should check if 5x under the square root can be further simplified:\n   - 5x is not a perfect square for any general x\n   - Therefore, \u221a(5x) cannot be simplified further\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that 150x\u221a(5x) is indeed the simplest radical form of our original expression \u221a(125x) * \u221a(20x) * \u221a(45x) in terms of x.\n\nThe acting agent should now focus on clearly stating and formatting the final answer, ensuring it matches the required form specified in the original problem.\n",
