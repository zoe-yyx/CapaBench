    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Evaluating $\\sqrt{125x} \\cdot \\sqrt{20x} \\cdot \\sqrt{45x}$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: We need to multiply three square roots and simplify the result.\n\n2. Analyze the components:\n   - Look at each term under the square roots: 125x, 20x, and 45x\n   - Notice that x is common in all terms\n\n3. Simplify under the radicals:\n   - Factor out the common x from each term\n   - Simplify the remaining numbers if possible\n\n4. Multiply the radicals:\n   - Use the property of multiplying radicals: $\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}$\n   - Multiply the terms under the radicals\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Factor the number under the final radical\n   - Separate perfect square factors from non-perfect square factors\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the simplified radical form\n   - Ensure x is expressed to the correct power\n\n7. Double-check the result:\n   - Verify that no further simplification is possible\n   - Confirm that the answer is in the simplest radical form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and properties of radicals that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by simplifying under the radicals. Let's begin with factoring out the common x from each term under the square roots. This will help us isolate the numerical factors and make the multiplication easier.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. Factor out x from each radical:\n   $\\sqrt{125x} = \\sqrt{125 \\cdot x} = \\sqrt{125} \\cdot \\sqrt{x}$\n   $\\sqrt{20x} = \\sqrt{20 \\cdot x} = \\sqrt{20} \\cdot \\sqrt{x}$\n   $\\sqrt{45x} = \\sqrt{45 \\cdot x} = \\sqrt{45} \\cdot \\sqrt{x}$\n\n2. Now we can rewrite the expression as:\n   $(\\sqrt{125} \\cdot \\sqrt{x}) \\cdot (\\sqrt{20} \\cdot \\sqrt{x}) \\cdot (\\sqrt{45} \\cdot \\sqrt{x})$\n\n3. Rearrange to group the numerical radicals and the x terms:\n   $(\\sqrt{125} \\cdot \\sqrt{20} \\cdot \\sqrt{45}) \\cdot (\\sqrt{x} \\cdot \\sqrt{x} \\cdot \\sqrt{x})$\n\nThe acting agent should focus on simplifying the numerical part $\\sqrt{125} \\cdot \\sqrt{20} \\cdot \\sqrt{45}$ first, as this will involve multiplying these numbers under the radical. The $\\sqrt{x}$ terms can be dealt with separately.\n",
