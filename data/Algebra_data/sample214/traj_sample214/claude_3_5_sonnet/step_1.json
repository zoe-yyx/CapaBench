Identify the problem: We need to multiply three square roots and simplify the result.\n\n2. Analyze the components:\n   - Look at each term under the square roots: 125x, 20x, and 45x\n   - Notice that x is common in all terms\n\n3. Simplify under the radicals:\n   - Factor out the common x from each term\n   - Simplify the remaining numbers if possible\n\n4. Multiply the radicals:\n   - Use the property of multiplying radicals: $\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}$\n   - Multiply the terms under the radicals\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Factor the number under the final radical\n   - Separate perfect square factors from non-perfect square factors\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the simplified radical form\n   - Ensure x is expressed to the correct power\n\n7. Double-check the result:\n   - Verify that no further simplification is possible\n   - Confirm that the answer is in the simplest radical form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and properties of radicals that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the result from the calculator and our previous steps, let's continue with our reasoning:\n\n1. We now have the numerical part calculated: $\\sqrt{125} \\cdot \\sqrt{20} \\cdot \\sqrt{45} \\approx 335.410196624968$\n\n2. We need to express this in exact form under a single radical. To do this, we should multiply the numbers under the radicals:\n   $\\sqrt{125 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 45} = \\sqrt{112500}$\n\n3. Now, we need to simplify $\\sqrt{112500}$:\n   - Factor 112500 to find any perfect square factors\n   - 112500 = 2^2 * 5^4 * 3^2\n   - We can take out the perfect square factors: $\\sqrt{112500} = \\sqrt{(2^2 * 5^4 * 3^2)} = 2 * 5^2 * 3 * \\sqrt{5} = 150\\sqrt{5}$\n\n4. Remember, we still have the x terms: $(\\sqrt{x})^3 = x\\sqrt{x}$\n\n5. Combining all parts, our expression becomes:\n   $150\\sqrt{5} \\cdot x\\sqrt{x} = 150x\\sqrt{5x}$\n\nThe acting agent should verify this final simplification by:\n1.
