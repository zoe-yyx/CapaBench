Identify the components:\n   - Recognize that we are dealing with two complex numbers in the form a + bi\n   - First complex number: 3 + 2i\n   - Second complex number: 1 + 4i\n\n2. Recall the rule for adding complex numbers:\n   - When adding complex numbers, we add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together\n\n3. Execute the addition:\n   - Add the real parts: 3 + 1\n   - Add the imaginary parts: 2i + 4i\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Write the sum in the standard form a + bi\n\n5. Simplify if necessary:\n   - Ensure that the final answer is in the simplest form\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check that no errors were made in the addition process\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the simplified complex number as the solution\n",

We have two complex numbers to add: (3 + 2i) and (1 + 4i).\n\n2. To add complex numbers, we need to add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together separately.\n\n3. The real parts are 3 and 1. We should add these together.\n\n4. The imaginary parts are 2i and 4i. We should add these together as well.\n\n5. After adding, we'll need to combine the results into a single complex number in the form a + bi.\n\n6. No further simplification should be necessary as we're dealing with simple addition of integers.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these calculations:\n- Add the real parts: 3 + 1\n- Add the imaginary parts: 2i + 4i\n- Combine the results into a single complex number\n\nThis reasoning will guide the acting agent to perform the necessary calculations to solve the problem.\n",
