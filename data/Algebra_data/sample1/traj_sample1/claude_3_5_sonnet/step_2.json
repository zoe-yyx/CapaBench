Identify the components:\n   - Recognize that we are dealing with two complex numbers in the form a + bi\n   - First complex number: 3 + 2i\n   - Second complex number: 1 + 4i\n\n2. Recall the rule for adding complex numbers:\n   - When adding complex numbers, we add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together\n\n3. Execute the addition:\n   - Add the real parts: 3 + 1\n   - Add the imaginary parts: 2i + 4i\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Write the sum in the standard form a + bi\n\n5. Simplify if necessary:\n   - Ensure that the final answer is in the simplest form\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check that no errors were made in the addition process\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the simplified complex number as the solution\n",

We have 4 as the real part from our first calculation (3 + 1 = 4).\n2. We have 6i as the imaginary part from our second calculation (2i + 4i = 6i).\n\nThe next step is to combine these results into the standard form of a complex number: a + bi.\n\nThe acting agent should:\n1. Write down the real part (4)\n2. Add the imaginary part (6i)\n3. Present the final answer in the form 4 + 6i\n\nThis will complete the simplification of (3 + 2i) + (1 + 4i).\n\nNo further calculations are needed at this point, as the complex number is now in its simplest form.\n",
