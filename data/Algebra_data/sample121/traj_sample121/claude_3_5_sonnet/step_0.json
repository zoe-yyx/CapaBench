    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to follow the first two steps of our planning strategy:\n\n1. We have the inequality |3x + 1| \u2264 8. This is an absolute value inequality, where the expression inside the absolute value signs must be less than or equal to 8.\n\n2. To solve this, we need to rewrite it as a compound inequality. The general form for an absolute value inequality |expression| \u2264 a is:\n\n   -a \u2264 expression \u2264 a\n\n   In our case, this becomes:\n   -8 \u2264 3x + 1 \u2264 8\n\nNow that we have rewritten the inequality, we can move on to solving for x. The next step would be to isolate x by performing the same operations on all parts of the compound inequality.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality and then dividing all parts by 3. This will isolate x and allow us to determine its range.\n",
