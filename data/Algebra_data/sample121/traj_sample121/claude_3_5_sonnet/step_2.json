Rewrite the absolute value inequality:\n   - Express it as a compound inequality: -8 \u2264 3x + 1 \u2264 8\n\n3. Solve for x:\n   - Subtract 1 from all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 3\n\n4. Identify the solution range:\n   - Determine the lower and upper bounds for x\n\n5. Find the minimum value:\n   - The minimum value will be the lower bound of the solution range\n\n6.

Once we have both sides, we'll have the complete solution range for x.\n\n4. The minimum value of x will be the lower bound of this range, which we've already calculated as -3.\n\n5. After we confirm the upper bound, we should verify that this solution satisfies the original inequality |3x + 1| \u2264 8.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to calculate (8-1)/3 to find the upper bound of the solution range. This will complete our solution and allow us to definitively state the minimum value of x.\n",
