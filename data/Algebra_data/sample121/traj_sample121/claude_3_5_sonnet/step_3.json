Rewrite the absolute value inequality:\n   - Express it as a compound inequality: -8 \u2264 3x + 1 \u2264 8\n\n3. Solve for x:\n   - Subtract 1 from all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 3\n\n4. Identify the solution range:\n   - Determine the lower and upper bounds for x\n\n5. Find the minimum value:\n   - The minimum value will be the lower bound of the solution range\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the minimum value back into the original inequality to confirm\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the minimum value of x\n",

As we're looking for the minimum value of x, we can confirm that it is indeed -3, which is the lower bound of our solution range.\n\n4. To verify this solution, we should substitute x = -3 into the original inequality |3x + 1| \u2264 8:\n   |3(-3) + 1| = |-9 + 1| = |-8| = 8\n   \n   This confirms that x = -3 satisfies the original inequality, as 8 \u2264 8.\n\n5.
