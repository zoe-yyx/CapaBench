    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the inequality:\n   - Analyze the given inequality: $|2x - 5| \\leq 9$\n   - Recognize this as an absolute value inequality\n\n2. Solve the inequality:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as two separate inequalities:\n     a) $2x - 5 \\leq 9$\n     b) $2x - 5 \\geq -9$\n   - Solve each inequality for x\n\n3. Determine the range of integer solutions:\n   - Identify the lowest and highest integer values that satisfy both inequalities\n   - List all integer values within this range\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Add up all the integer solutions found in step 3\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the sum is correct by substituting values into the original inequality\n   - Ensure all integer solutions within the range are accounted for\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the final sum calculation if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the verification step we just completed, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. We have successfully solved the inequality and identified all integer solutions within the range -2 \u2264 x \u2264 7.\n\n2. We calculated the sum of these integer solutions, which is 25.\n\n3. We verified that all integer values from -2 to 7 satisfy the original inequality |2x - 5| \u2264 9.\n\nGiven that all steps of our plan have been executed and verified, we can conclude that our solution is correct and complete. The sum of all integer solutions for the inequality |2x - 5| \u2264 9 is indeed 25.\n\nAt this point, we have fully solved the problem and no further calculations or verifications are necessary. The acting agent can now prepare to present the final answer and explain the solution process if required.\n",
