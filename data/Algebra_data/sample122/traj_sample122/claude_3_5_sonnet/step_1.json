    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the inequality:\n   - Analyze the given inequality: $|2x - 5| \\leq 9$\n   - Recognize this as an absolute value inequality\n\n2. Solve the inequality:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as two separate inequalities:\n     a) $2x - 5 \\leq 9$\n     b) $2x - 5 \\geq -9$\n   - Solve each inequality for x\n\n3. Determine the range of integer solutions:\n   - Identify the lowest and highest integer values that satisfy both inequalities\n   - List all integer values within this range\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Add up all the integer solutions found in step 3\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the sum is correct by substituting values into the original inequality\n   - Ensure all integer solutions within the range are accounted for\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the final sum calculation if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy and the historical action, we should now focus on solving the two inequalities derived from the original absolute value inequality. This step is crucial for determining the range of x values that satisfy the original inequality.\n\nLet's reason through solving these inequalities:\n\n1. For $2x - 5 \\leq 9$:\n   - Add 5 to both sides: $2x \\leq 14$\n   - Divide both sides by 2: $x \\leq 7$\n\n2. For $2x - 5 \\geq -9$:\n   - Add 5 to both sides: $2x \\geq -4$\n   - Divide both sides by 2: $x \\geq -2$\n\nCombining these results, we can conclude that the solution to the original inequality is:\n\n$-2 \\leq x \\leq 7$\n\nThis gives us the range of x values that satisfy the inequality. The next step should be to determine the integer values within this range, as these will be our solutions.\n",
