    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the inequality:\n   - Analyze the given inequality: $|2x - 5| \\leq 9$\n   - Recognize this as an absolute value inequality\n\n2. Solve the inequality:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as two separate inequalities:\n     a) $2x - 5 \\leq 9$\n     b) $2x - 5 \\geq -9$\n   - Solve each inequality for x\n\n3. Determine the range of integer solutions:\n   - Identify the lowest and highest integer values that satisfy both inequalities\n   - List all integer values within this range\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Add up all the integer solutions found in step 3\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the sum is correct by substituting values into the original inequality\n   - Ensure all integer solutions within the range are accounted for\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the final sum calculation if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the planning strategy, we have successfully completed several important steps:\n\n1. We solved the inequality |2x - 5| \u2264 9 by breaking it into two separate inequalities.\n2. We determined the range of x values that satisfy the inequality: -2 \u2264 x \u2264 7.\n3. We listed all integer values within this range: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4. We calculated the sum of these integer values, which is 25.\n\nNow, we need to focus on the final step of our plan: verifying the solution. To do this, we should:\n\n1. Confirm that 25 is indeed the correct sum of all integer solutions.\n2. Verify that each integer value we used (-2 through 7) actually satisfies the original inequality |2x - 5| \u2264 9.\n\nFor the verification, we need to substitute each integer value into the original inequality and check if it holds true. This will ensure that our solution is comprehensive and correct.\n\nThe acting agent should now proceed with this verification step, potentially using a calculator to check the inequality for each integer value from -2 to 7.\n",
