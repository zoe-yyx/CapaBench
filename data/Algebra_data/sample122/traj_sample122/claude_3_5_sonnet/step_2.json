    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the inequality:\n   - Analyze the given inequality: $|2x - 5| \\leq 9$\n   - Recognize this as an absolute value inequality\n\n2. Solve the inequality:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as two separate inequalities:\n     a) $2x - 5 \\leq 9$\n     b) $2x - 5 \\geq -9$\n   - Solve each inequality for x\n\n3. Determine the range of integer solutions:\n   - Identify the lowest and highest integer values that satisfy both inequalities\n   - List all integer values within this range\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Add up all the integer solutions found in step 3\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the sum is correct by substituting values into the original inequality\n   - Ensure all integer solutions within the range are accounted for\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the final sum calculation if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have solved the inequalities and listed the range of integer values for x, we need to identify all the specific integer solutions within this range. \n\nThe range -2 \u2264 x \u2264 7 includes the following integer values:\n-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nThese are all the integer solutions that satisfy the original inequality |2x - 5| \u2264 9.\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate the sum of these integer solutions. We need to add up all these numbers to get our final answer. This can be done either manually or using a calculator for efficiency.\n\nAfter calculating the sum, we should verify our answer by checking if it satisfies the original inequality for all the values we identified.\n",
