    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the inequality:\n   - Analyze the given inequality: $|2x - 5| \\leq 9$\n   - Recognize this as an absolute value inequality\n\n2. Solve the inequality:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as two separate inequalities:\n     a) $2x - 5 \\leq 9$\n     b) $2x - 5 \\geq -9$\n   - Solve each inequality for x\n\n3. Determine the range of integer solutions:\n   - Identify the lowest and highest integer values that satisfy both inequalities\n   - List all integer values within this range\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Add up all the integer solutions found in step 3\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the sum is correct by substituting values into the original inequality\n   - Ensure all integer solutions within the range are accounted for\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the final sum calculation if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we're at the beginning of solving this problem, our first step should be to analyze and rewrite the inequality. \n\nLet's start by rewriting the absolute value inequality |2x - 5| \u2264 9 as two separate inequalities:\n\n1) 2x - 5 \u2264 9\n2) 2x - 5 \u2265 -9\n\nThis transformation is a crucial step in solving absolute value inequalities. It allows us to work with standard inequalities, which are easier to solve.\n\nThe next logical step would be to solve these inequalities for x. This will give us the range of x values that satisfy the original inequality. \n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent proceed with solving these two inequalities:\n\n1) Solve 2x - 5 \u2264 9 for x\n2) Solve 2x - 5 \u2265 -9 for x\n\nThis will set us up to determine the range of integer solutions in the subsequent steps.\n",
