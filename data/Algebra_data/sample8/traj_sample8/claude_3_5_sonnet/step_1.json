    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Math Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Point coordinates: (x, y) = (5, 7)\n   - Expression to evaluate: 2y^2 - 5xy + 6\n\n2. Substitute the known values:\n   - Replace x with 5 and y with 7 in the expression\n\n3. Calculate each term separately:\n   a. Calculate 2y^2\n   b. Calculate -5xy\n   c. Add 6 to the result\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add all the calculated terms together\n\n5. Perform final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator to ensure accuracy in the final result\n\n6. Review and verify:\n   - Double-check the substitution and calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is a single numerical value\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for precise computations at each step.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We've successfully calculated the first term of the expression, 2y^2, which equals 98.\n\n2. The next logical step is to calculate the second term, -5xy. We need to:\n   a) Substitute x = 5 and y = 7 into this term\n   b) Perform the multiplication\n\n3. After calculating -5xy, we'll have two of the three terms needed for our final result.\n\n4. The constant term 6 doesn't require any calculation, so we can leave it as is for now.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the calculator to compute:\n\n-5 * 5 * 7\n\nThis will give us the value of the second term in our expression. Once we have this result, we'll be ready to combine all three terms to get our final answer.\n",
