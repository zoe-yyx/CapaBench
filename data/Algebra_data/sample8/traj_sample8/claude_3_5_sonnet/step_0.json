Identify the given information:\n   - Point coordinates: (x, y) = (5, 7)\n   - Expression to evaluate: 2y^2 - 5xy + 6\n\n2. Substitute the known values:\n   - Replace x with 5 and y with 7 in the expression\n\n3. Calculate each term separately:\n   a. Calculate 2y^2\n   b. Calculate -5xy\n   c. Add 6 to the result\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add all the calculated terms together\n\n5. Perform final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator to ensure accuracy in the final result\n\n6. Review and verify:\n   - Double-check the substitution and calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is a single numerical value\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for precise computations at each step.\n",

We should substitute x = 5 and y = 7 into this expression.\n\nLet's break down the substitution process:\n\na) For the term 2y^2:\n   - Replace y with 7\n   - This becomes 2(7^2)\n\nb) For the term -5xy:\n   - Replace x with 5 and y with 7\n   - This becomes -5(5)(7)\n\nc) The last term 6 remains as is.\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate each of these terms separately. The acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n\n1. 2(7^2)\n2. -5(5)(7)\n\nAfter these calculations, we'll be ready to combine the results with the constant term 6.\n",
