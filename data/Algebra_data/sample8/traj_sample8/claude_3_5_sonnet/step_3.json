    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Math Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Point coordinates: (x, y) = (5, 7)\n   - Expression to evaluate: 2y^2 - 5xy + 6\n\n2. Substitute the known values:\n   - Replace x with 5 and y with 7 in the expression\n\n3. Calculate each term separately:\n   a. Calculate 2y^2\n   b. Calculate -5xy\n   c. Add 6 to the result\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add all the calculated terms together\n\n5. Perform final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator to ensure accuracy in the final result\n\n6. Review and verify:\n   - Double-check the substitution and calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is a single numerical value\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for precise computations at each step.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We have successfully completed all the calculations required to solve the problem:\n   - We calculated 2y^2 = 98\n   - We calculated -5xy = -175\n   - We added the constant term 6\n   - We combined all terms: 98 - 175 + 6 = -71\n\n2. The final result of -71 represents the value of the expression 2y^2 - 5xy + 6 for the point (x, y) = (5, 7).\n\n3. According to our initial plan, we have completed all the necessary steps:\n   - We identified the given information\n   - We substituted the known values\n   - We calculated each term separately\n   - We combined the results\n   - We performed the final calculation\n\n4. The next logical step is to review and verify our solution:\n   - Double-check the substitution: We correctly used x = 5 and y = 7\n   - Verify the calculations: Each step was performed using a calculator for accuracy\n   - Confirm the final answer: We have a single numerical value as required\n\n5. It appears that we have successfully solved the problem within the expected number of rounds.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should now focus on summarizing the solution and presenting the final answer.
