Identify the given information:\n   - Point coordinates: (x, y) = (5, 7)\n   - Expression to evaluate: 2y^2 - 5xy + 6\n\n2. Substitute the known values:\n   - Replace x with 5 and y with 7 in the expression\n\n3. Calculate each term separately:\n   a. Calculate 2y^2\n   b. Calculate -5xy\n   c. Add 6 to the result\n\n4. Combine the results:\n   - Add all the calculated terms together\n\n5. Perform final calculation:\n   - Use a calculator to ensure accuracy in the final result\n\n6. Review and verify:\n   - Double-check the substitution and calculations\n   - Ensure the final answer is a single numerical value\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for precise computations at each step.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We have successfully calculated the first two terms of the expression:\n   - 2y^2 = 98\n   - -5xy = -175\n\n2. The third term is the constant 6, which doesn't require any calculation.\n\n3. Now, we need to combine all three terms to get our final result.\n\n4. The expression we're evaluating is 2y^2 - 5xy + 6, which now translates to:\n   98 - 175 + 6\n\n5. The next logical step is to perform this final calculation to obtain the result.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the calculator to compute:\n\n98 - 175 + 6\n\nThis will give us the final value of the expression 2y^2 - 5xy + 6 for the point (x, y) = (5, 7). After this calculation, we will have completed all steps in our plan and solved the problem.\n",
