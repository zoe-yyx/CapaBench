    "observation": "Consider an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 3 and each subsequent term increases by 7. What is the value of the 50th term?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components of the arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a\u2081) = 3\n   - Common difference (d) = 7\n   - We need to find the 50th term (n = 50)\n\n2. Recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n   a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n - 1)d\n\n3. Substitute the known values into the formula:\n   a\u2085\u2080 = 3 + (50 - 1) * 7\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   a\u2085\u2080 = 3 + 49 * 7\n\n5. Calculate the result:\n   - Multiply 49 by 7\n   - Add 3 to the result\n\n6. Present the final answer as the 50th term of the sequence.\n\n7. Optional: Verify the answer by calculating a few terms of the sequence manually to ensure the result aligns with the pattern.\n\n8.
