    "observation": "Consider an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 3 and each subsequent term increases by 7. What is the value of the 50th term?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components of the arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a\u2081) = 3\n   - Common difference (d) = 7\n   - We need to find the 50th term (n = 50)\n\n2. Recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n   a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n - 1)d\n\n3. Substitute the known values into the formula:\n   a\u2085\u2080 = 3 + (50 - 1) * 7\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   a\u2085\u2080 = 3 + 49 * 7\n\n5. Calculate the result:\n   - Multiply 49 by 7\n   - Add 3 to the result\n\n6. Present the final answer as the 50th term of the sequence.\n\n7. Optional: Verify the answer by calculating a few terms of the sequence manually to ensure the result aligns with the pattern.\n\n8. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider any alternative methods that could have been used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We have correctly calculated the 50th term of the arithmetic sequence as 346.\n\n2. The calculation process was accurate:\n   a\u2085\u2080 = 3 + (50 - 1) * 7 = 3 + 49 * 7 = 3 + 343 = 346\n\n3. However, our previous response included unnecessary notation, which led to an incorrect final answer.\n\n4. To address this issue, we need to provide the answer in its simplest form, without any additional notation or text.\n\n5. The acting agent should now present the final answer as just the numerical value 346.\n\n6. This approach ensures that we're providing exactly what the question asks for - the value of the 50th term, nothing more and nothing less.\n\n7. By presenting the answer in this clear, concise manner, we avoid any potential misinterpretation or marking errors.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to state the final answer as simply \"346\", without any additional text or mathematical notation.\n",
