    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Complex Number Equation:\n\n1. Expand the left side of the equation:\n   - Multiply (x+yi) by (3-4i) using the distributive property\n   - Simplify the result into real and imaginary parts\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Equate the real parts of both sides\n   - Equate the imaginary parts of both sides\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Use substitution or elimination method to solve for x and y\n   - Remember that x and y are integers, which may help in narrowing down solutions\n\n4. Calculate x + y:\n   - Once x and y are found, simply add them together\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation to ensure correctness\n\nKey Considerations:\n- Use the properties of complex numbers for multiplication\n- Be careful with the signs when expanding and simplifying\n- The equation i^2 = -1 will be useful in simplification\n- The fact that x and y are integers may lead to a unique solution\n\nTools to Use:\n- Calculator for any necessary arithmetic calculations\n- Search engine if needed to review complex number properties or equation-solving techniques\n\nGoal: \nDetermine the value of x + y within the given 10 rounds by following this systematic approach.\n",
