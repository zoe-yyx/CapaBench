    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Complex Number Equation:\n\n1. Expand the left side of the equation:\n   - Multiply (x+yi) by (3-4i) using the distributive property\n   - Simplify the result into real and imaginary parts\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Equate the real parts of both sides\n   - Equate the imaginary parts of both sides\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Use substitution or elimination method to solve for x and y\n   - Remember that x and y are integers, which may help in narrowing down solutions\n\n4. Calculate x + y:\n   - Once x and y are found, simply add them together\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation to ensure correctness\n\nKey Considerations:\n- Use the properties of complex numbers for multiplication\n- Be careful with the signs when expanding and simplifying\n- The equation i^2 = -1 will be useful in simplification\n- The fact that x and y are integers may lead to a unique solution\n\nTools to Use:\n- Calculator for any necessary arithmetic calculations\n- Search engine if needed to review complex number properties or equation-solving techniques\n\nGoal: \nDetermine the value of x + y within the given 10 rounds by following this systematic approach.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and reasoning, we have found potential integer values for x and y that satisfy the first equation of our system. Let's continue our reasoning:\n\n1. We found that x = 2 and y = 3 satisfy the first equation: 3x + 4y = 18\n\n2. Now, we need to verify if these values also satisfy the second equation: 3y - 4x = 1\n\n3. Let's substitute x = 2 and y = 3 into this equation:\n\n   3(3) - 4(2) = ?\n   9 - 8 = ?\n   1 = ?\n\n4. If this calculation results in 1, then we have found the correct integer solutions for x and y.\n\n5. Once we confirm these values, we can proceed to calculate x + y to solve the original problem.\n\n6. If these values don't satisfy both equations, we'll need to try the next set of integer values.\n\nThe next step should be to use the calculator to verify if 3y - 4x = 1 when x = 2 and y = 3.\n",
