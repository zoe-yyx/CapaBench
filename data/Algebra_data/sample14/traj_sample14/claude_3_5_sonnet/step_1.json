Simplify the inner exponents:\n   - Calculate $3^2$ = 9\n\n3. Rewrite the expression:\n   - Express as $9^9$\n\n4. Use the laws of exponents:\n   - Rewrite $9^9$ as $(3^2)^9$\n\n5. Apply the power rule of exponents:\n   - Simplify $(3^2)^9$ to $3^{2 \\times 9}$\n\n6. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Calculate $2 \\times 9 = 18$\n\n7. Express the result:\n   - Write the final answer as $3^{18}$\n\n8. Identify the value of M:\n   - Conclude that $M = 18$\n\n9. Verify the result:\n   - Check if $3^{18}$ is indeed equal to $(3^2)^{(3^2)}$\n\n10. Summarize the solution:\n    - Present the final answer: $M = 18$\n",

We've simplified the original expression $(3^2)^{(3^2)}$ to $9^9$.\n\n2. Our goal is to express this in the form of $3^M$. To do this, we need to use the laws of exponents.\n\n3. We know that $9 = 3^2$, so we can rewrite $9^9$ as $(3^2)^9$.\n\n4. The next critical step is to apply the power rule of exponents. This rule states that $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our expression $(3^2)^9$, we get $3^{2 \\times 9}$.\n\nTherefore, the next logical operation is to calculate 2 \u00d7 9. This will give us the value of M in our final expression $3^M$.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 2 by 9. This calculation will provide us with the final value of M, allowing us to express our answer in the required form and complete the problem-solving process.\n",
