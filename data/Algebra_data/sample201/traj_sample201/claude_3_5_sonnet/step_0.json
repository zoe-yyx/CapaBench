Simplify i^13:\n   - Break down 13 into multiples of 4 plus remainder\n   - i^13 = i^(12+1) = (i^4)^3 * i^1 = 1^3 * i = i\n\n3. Simplify i^-13:\n   - Use the property that i^-n = 1/(i^n)\n   - i^-13 = 1/(i^13) = 1/i = -i\n\n4. Simplify i^101:\n   - Break down 101 into multiples of 4 plus remainder\n   - i^101 = i^(100+1) = (i^4)^25 * i^1 = 1^25 * i = i\n\n5. Combine the simplified terms:\n   i + (-i) + i\n\n6. Perform the addition:\n   The -i and i cancel out, leaving just i\n\n7. Final answer:\n   (i^13 + i^-13 + i^101) = i\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy provided, our reasoning should guide the acting agent through the simplification process of each term in the expression (i^13 + i^-13 + i^101).\n\nLet's start with i^13:\n1. We know that i^4 = 1, so we can break down 13 into 12 + 1.\n2. i^13 = i^(12+1) = (i^4)^3 * i^1 = 1^3 * i = i\n\nNext, let's consider i^-13:\n1. We can use the property that i^-n = 1/(i^n).\n2. i^-13 = 1/(i^13) = 1/i\n3. To simplify 1/i, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by i: (1/i) * (i/i) = i/i^2 = i/(-1) = -i\n\nFor i^101:\n1. We can break down 101 into 100 + 1.\n2. i^101 = i^(100+1) = (i^4)^25 * i^1 = 1^25 * i = i\n\nNow we have simplified all terms to:\ni + (-i) + i\n\nThe next step would be to combine these terms. The acting agent should perform this addition.\n",
