    "reasoning": "\nTo simplify the expression $(2 + 3i) + (5 - 2i)$, we need to apply the rules for adding complex numbers. Let's break this down:\n\n1. We have two complex numbers: (2 + 3i) and (5 - 2i).\n2. When adding complex numbers, we add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together.\n3. The real parts are 2 and 5.\n4. The imaginary parts are 3i and -2i.\n\nOur next step should be to perform these additions:\n- Add the real parts: 2 + 5\n- Add the imaginary parts: 3i + (-2i)\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these additions separately. This will give us the simplified real and imaginary parts of the result.\n",
