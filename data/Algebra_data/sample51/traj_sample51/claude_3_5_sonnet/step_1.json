    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous action and our planning strategy, we have successfully calculated the real part of our complex number addition. The real part is 7.\n\nNow, we need to focus on the imaginary part. We need to add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers: 3i and -2i.\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate 3i + (-2i). This is equivalent to (3 - 2)i.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the calculator to compute 3 - 2. This will give us the coefficient of the imaginary part in our final answer.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have both the real and imaginary parts of our simplified complex number, allowing us to express it in the standard form a + bi.\n",
