    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Understand the sequence:\n   - Initial term: a\u2081 = 1000\n   - Recursive formula: a(n+1) = a(n) - n for n \u2265 1\n\n2. Calculate the first few terms manually to observe the pattern:\n   - a\u2081 = 1000\n   - a\u2082 = a\u2081 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n   - a\u2083 = a\u2082 - 2 = 999 - 2 = 997\n   - a\u2084 = a\u2083 - 3 = 997 - 3 = 994\n\n3. Recognize the pattern:\n   - Each term decreases by an increasing amount (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n   - The sequence will eventually become negative\n\n4. Develop a formula for the nth term:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))\n   - Use the sum of arithmetic sequence formula: \u03a3(1 to n-1) = n(n-1)/2\n\n5. Simplify the formula:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - n(n-1)/2\n\n6. Set up an inequality to find when a(n) becomes negative:\n   - 1000 - n(n-1)/2 < 0\n\n7. Solve the inequality:\n   - n(n-1)/2 > 1000\n   - n\u00b2 - n - 2000 > 0\n\n8. Use the quadratic formula or trial and error to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the inequality\n\n9. Verify the result by calculating the exact value of a(n) for the found n and n-1\n\n10. Present the final answer: the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0\n\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the planning strategy, we have now confirmed:\n\na\u2081 = 1000\na\u2082 = 999\na\u2083 = 997\na\u2084 = 994\n\nWe can observe that the sequence is indeed decreasing by an increasing amount each time, as predicted in our planning strategy. Now, let's continue with the next step in our plan:\n\n1. Calculate a\u2085 using the formula a\u2085 = a\u2084 - 4\n   We know a\u2084 = 994, so we need to calculate 994 - 4\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have the first five terms of the sequence, which will complete our initial observation of the pattern. This will allow us to move forward with developing the general formula for the nth term.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to calculate a\u2085 by subtracting 4 from 994. This will give us a clear view of how the sequence is behaving in its initial terms and confirm that we're correctly applying the recursive formula for multiple iterations.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be ready to move on to the next phase of our plan: developing the formula for the nth term using the sum of arithmetic sequence formula.\n",
