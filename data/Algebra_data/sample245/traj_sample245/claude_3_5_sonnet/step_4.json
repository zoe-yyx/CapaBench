    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Understand the sequence:\n   - Initial term: a\u2081 = 1000\n   - Recursive formula: a(n+1) = a(n) - n for n \u2265 1\n\n2. Calculate the first few terms manually to observe the pattern:\n   - a\u2081 = 1000\n   - a\u2082 = a\u2081 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n   - a\u2083 = a\u2082 - 2 = 999 - 2 = 997\n   - a\u2084 = a\u2083 - 3 = 997 - 3 = 994\n\n3. Recognize the pattern:\n   - Each term decreases by an increasing amount (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n   - The sequence will eventually become negative\n\n4. Develop a formula for the nth term:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))\n   - Use the sum of arithmetic sequence formula: \u03a3(1 to n-1) = n(n-1)/2\n\n5. Simplify the formula:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - n(n-1)/2\n\n6. Set up an inequality to find when a(n) becomes negative:\n   - 1000 - n(n-1)/2 < 0\n\n7. Solve the inequality:\n   - n(n-1)/2 > 1000\n   - n\u00b2 - n - 2000 > 0\n\n8. Use the quadratic formula or trial and error to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the inequality\n\n9. Verify the result by calculating the exact value of a(n) for the found n and n-1\n\n10. Present the final answer: the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0\n\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations, we have now confirmed the first five terms of the sequence:\n\na\u2081 = 1000\na\u2082 = 999\na\u2083 = 997\na\u2084 = 994\na\u2085 = 990\n\nThis pattern aligns with our understanding of the recursive formula a(n+1) = a(n) - n.

Develop a formula for the nth term:\n   We noted that a(n) = 1000 - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))\n   This sum can be represented using the sum of arithmetic sequence formula: \u03a3(1 to n-1) = n(n-1)/2\n\n2.

Set up an inequality to find when a(n) becomes negative:\n   1000 - n(n-1)/2 < 0\n\nOur next step should be to solve this inequality to find the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0. To do this, we need to rearrange the inequality:\n\nn(n-1)/2 > 1000\nn\u00b2 - n - 2000 > 0\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, we can find the roots of the quadratic equation n\u00b2 - n - 2000 = 0 using the quadratic formula, or we can use a method of trial and error to find the smallest integer n that satisfies the inequality.\n\nGiven that we're looking for the smallest positive integer n, and considering the magnitude of the constant term (2000), it might be more efficient to use a trial and error approach starting from a reasonable estimate.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to start testing values of n, beginning with n = 45, as it's a reasonable starting point given the magnitude of the numbers we're dealing with.
