    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Understand the sequence:\n   - Initial term: a\u2081 = 1000\n   - Recursive formula: a(n+1) = a(n) - n for n \u2265 1\n\n2. Calculate the first few terms manually to observe the pattern:\n   - a\u2081 = 1000\n   - a\u2082 = a\u2081 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n   - a\u2083 = a\u2082 - 2 = 999 - 2 = 997\n   - a\u2084 = a\u2083 - 3 = 997 - 3 = 994\n\n3. Recognize the pattern:\n   - Each term decreases by an increasing amount (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n   - The sequence will eventually become negative\n\n4. Develop a formula for the nth term:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))\n   - Use the sum of arithmetic sequence formula: \u03a3(1 to n-1) = n(n-1)/2\n\n5. Simplify the formula:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - n(n-1)/2\n\n6. Set up an inequality to find when a(n) becomes negative:\n   - 1000 - n(n-1)/2 < 0\n\n7. Solve the inequality:\n   - n(n-1)/2 > 1000\n   - n\u00b2 - n - 2000 > 0\n\n8. Use the quadratic formula or trial and error to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the inequality\n\n9. Verify the result by calculating the exact value of a(n) for the found n and n-1\n\n10. Present the final answer: the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0\n\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by calculating the first few terms of the sequence to observe the pattern and verify our understanding of the recursive formula.

Calculate a\u2081 (which is given as 1000)\n2. Calculate a\u2082 using the formula a\u2082 = a\u2081 - 1\n3. Calculate a\u2083 using the formula a\u2083 = a\u2082 - 2\n4. Calculate a\u2084 using the formula a\u2084 = a\u2083 - 3\n5. Calculate a\u2085 using the formula a\u2085 = a\u2084 - 4\n\nThis will give us a clear view of how the sequence behaves in its initial terms and confirm that we're correctly applying the recursive formula. It will also help us visualize how quickly the sequence is decreasing, which will be useful for estimating the range where the sequence might first become negative.\n",
