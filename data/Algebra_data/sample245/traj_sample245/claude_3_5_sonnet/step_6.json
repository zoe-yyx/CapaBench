    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Understand the sequence:\n   - Initial term: a\u2081 = 1000\n   - Recursive formula: a(n+1) = a(n) - n for n \u2265 1\n\n2. Calculate the first few terms manually to observe the pattern:\n   - a\u2081 = 1000\n   - a\u2082 = a\u2081 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n   - a\u2083 = a\u2082 - 2 = 999 - 2 = 997\n   - a\u2084 = a\u2083 - 3 = 997 - 3 = 994\n\n3. Recognize the pattern:\n   - Each term decreases by an increasing amount (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n   - The sequence will eventually become negative\n\n4. Develop a formula for the nth term:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))\n   - Use the sum of arithmetic sequence formula: \u03a3(1 to n-1) = n(n-1)/2\n\n5. Simplify the formula:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - n(n-1)/2\n\n6. Set up an inequality to find when a(n) becomes negative:\n   - 1000 - n(n-1)/2 < 0\n\n7. Solve the inequality:\n   - n(n-1)/2 > 1000\n   - n\u00b2 - n - 2000 > 0\n\n8. Use the quadratic formula or trial and error to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the inequality\n\n9. Verify the result by calculating the exact value of a(n) for the found n and n-1\n\n10. Present the final answer: the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0\n\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations, we've found that:\na(45) = 10 (positive)\na(47) = -81 (negative)\n\nThis tells us that the sequence first becomes negative somewhere between n = 45 and n = 47. We've successfully narrowed down our range, but we need to find the exact value of n where this transition occurs.\n\nGiven that we're looking for the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0, our next logical step is to check the value in between 45 and 47, which is 46.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to calculate a(46) using our simplified formula:\na(46) = 1000 - 46(46-1)/2\n\nThis calculation will give us one of three possible outcomes:\n1. If a(46) > 0, then 47 is our answer (as we've already confirmed a(47) < 0).\n2. If a(46) = 0, then 47 is still our answer (as we need the first n where a(n) is strictly less than 0).\n3. If a(46) < 0, then 46 is our answer.\n\nBy checking a(46), we'll be able to definitively determine the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0, thus solving our problem.\n",
