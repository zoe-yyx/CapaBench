    "observation": "Consider the sequence defined recursively by $a_1 = 1000$ and $a_{n+1} = a_n - n$ for $n \\geq 1$. Determine the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $a_n < 0$.",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Understand the sequence:\n   - Initial term: a\u2081 = 1000\n   - Recursive formula: a(n+1) = a(n) - n for n \u2265 1\n\n2. Calculate the first few terms manually to observe the pattern:\n   - a\u2081 = 1000\n   - a\u2082 = a\u2081 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999\n   - a\u2083 = a\u2082 - 2 = 999 - 2 = 997\n   - a\u2084 = a\u2083 - 3 = 997 - 3 = 994\n\n3. Recognize the pattern:\n   - Each term decreases by an increasing amount (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)\n   - The sequence will eventually become negative\n\n4. Develop a formula for the nth term:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1))\n   - Use the sum of arithmetic sequence formula: \u03a3(1 to n-1) = n(n-1)/2\n\n5. Simplify the formula:\n   - a(n) = 1000 - n(n-1)/2\n\n6. Set up an inequality to find when a(n) becomes negative:\n   - 1000 - n(n-1)/2 < 0\n\n7. Solve the inequality:\n   - n(n-1)/2 > 1000\n   - n\u00b2 - n - 2000 > 0\n\n8. Use the quadratic formula or trial and error to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the inequality\n\n9. Verify the result by calculating the exact value of a(n) for the found n and n-1\n\n10. Present the final answer: the smallest positive integer n for which a(n) < 0\n\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the trial with n = 45, we found that a(45) = 10, which is still positive. This tells us that we need to try a larger value of n to find where the sequence first becomes negative.\n\nLet's analyze our progress:\n1. We've confirmed the pattern of the sequence for the first five terms.\n2. We've developed and simplified the general formula: a(n) = 1000 - n(n-1)/2\n3. We've set up the inequality: n\u00b2 - n - 2000 > 0\n4. We've tested n = 45 and found it's not large enough.\n\nOur next step should be to continue the trial and error approach, but we need to choose our next value of n more strategically. Since a(45) was close to 0 but still positive, let's try a slightly larger value, say n = 47.\n\nThe reasoning for choosing 47 is:\n1. It's a small increment from 45, which allows us to narrow down the range more precisely.\n2. It's an odd number, which might be significant as we're looking for the exact point where the sequence crosses zero.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to calculate a(47) using our simplified formula:\na(47) = 1000 - 47(47-1)/2\n\nIf this value is negative, we'll know the answer lies between 45 and 47. If it's still positive, we'll need to try a larger value.\n",
