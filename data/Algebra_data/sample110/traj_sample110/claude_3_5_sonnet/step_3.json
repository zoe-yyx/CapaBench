Set up a system of equations:\n   - Equation 1: y = 2x - 3\n   - Equation 2: 3x - y = 4\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Substitute the expression for y from Equation 1 into Equation 2\n   b. Solve for x\n   c. Use the found x-value to calculate y using either of the original equations\n\n4. Identify the coordinates of point B:\n   - x-coordinate will be the solved value of x\n   - y-coordinate will be the solved value of y\n\n5. Calculate the sum of the coordinates:\n   - Add the x and y coordinates of point B\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the coordinates satisfy both original equations\n\n7.

We need to verify if the point (1, -1) satisfies the second equation: 3x - y = 4\n\n2. We should substitute x = 1 and y = -1 into this equation:\n   3(1) - (-1) = 4\n\n3.

After these calculations, we should compare the result to 4 to verify if the equation holds true.\n\n5. If both equations are satisfied, we can conclude that our solution is correct.\n\n6.
