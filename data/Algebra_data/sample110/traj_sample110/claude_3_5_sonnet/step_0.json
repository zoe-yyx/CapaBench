    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given equations:\n   - Line 1: y = 2x - 3\n   - Line 2: 3x - y = 4\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Equation 1: y = 2x - 3\n   - Equation 2: 3x - y = 4\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Substitute the expression for y from Equation 1 into Equation 2\n   b. Solve for x\n   c. Use the found x-value to calculate y using either of the original equations\n\n4. Identify the coordinates of point B:\n   - x-coordinate will be the solved value of x\n   - y-coordinate will be the solved value of y\n\n5. Calculate the sum of the coordinates:\n   - Add the x and y coordinates of point B\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the coordinates satisfy both original equations\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of the coordinates of point B\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for precise calculations if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe should start by setting up the system of equations as outlined in step 2 of the planning strategy. We have two equations:\n\n1. y = 2x - 3\n2. 3x - y = 4\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations to find the coordinates of point B. The most efficient method would be to substitute the expression for y from equation 1 into equation 2, as suggested in step 3a of the plan.\n\nLet's substitute y = 2x - 3 into the equation 3x - y = 4:\n\n3x - (2x - 3) = 4\n\nThis will give us an equation with only x, which we can then solve to find the x-coordinate of point B. Once we have x, we can use either of the original equations to find y.\n\nThe acting agent should now perform this substitution and solve for x using algebraic manipulation. A calculator may be useful for any arithmetic operations that arise during this process.\n",
