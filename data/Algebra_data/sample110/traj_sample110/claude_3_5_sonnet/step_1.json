    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given equations:\n   - Line 1: y = 2x - 3\n   - Line 2: 3x - y = 4\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Equation 1: y = 2x - 3\n   - Equation 2: 3x - y = 4\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Substitute the expression for y from Equation 1 into Equation 2\n   b. Solve for x\n   c. Use the found x-value to calculate y using either of the original equations\n\n4. Identify the coordinates of point B:\n   - x-coordinate will be the solved value of x\n   - y-coordinate will be the solved value of y\n\n5. Calculate the sum of the coordinates:\n   - Add the x and y coordinates of point B\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the coordinates satisfy both original equations\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we've decided to substitute y = 2x - 3 into the equation 3x - y = 4, let's proceed with this substitution and solve for x:\n\n1. Start with 3x - y = 4\n2. Substitute y with 2x - 3:\n   3x - (2x - 3) = 4\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x. This involves:\n3. Distributing the negative sign:\n   3x - 2x + 3 = 4\n4. Combining like terms:\n   x + 3 = 4\n5. Subtracting 3 from both sides:\n   x = 1\n\nAfter solving for x, we can find y by substituting x = 1 into either of the original equations. Let's use y = 2x - 3:\n\n6. y = 2(1) - 3\n   y = 2 - 3\n   y = -1\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point B are (1, -1).\n\nThe next step should be to calculate the sum of these coordinates.\n",
