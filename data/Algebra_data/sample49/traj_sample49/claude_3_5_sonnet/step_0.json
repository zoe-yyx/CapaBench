    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - A cookie tin has 30 calories\n   - This represents 1.5% of a person's daily caloric requirement\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n   - Let x be the total daily caloric requirement\n   - 30 calories = 1.5% of x\n\n3. Convert the percentage to a decimal:\n   - 1.5% = 0.015\n\n4. Create the mathematical equation:\n   30 = 0.015x\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - Divide both sides by 0.015\n\n6. Calculate the result:\n   - Use a calculator to perform the division\n\n7. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Depending on the result, round to a whole number or nearest ten\n\n8. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if 1.5% of the calculated daily caloric requirement equals 30 calories\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State the total daily caloric requirement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should start by setting up the equation as outlined in steps 2 and 3 of the plan. \n\nWe know that 30 calories represents 1.5% of the total daily caloric requirement. Let's call the total daily caloric requirement 'x'.\n\nWe can express this as an equation:\n30 = 1.5% of x\n\nTo make this easier to work with, we should convert the percentage to a decimal, as mentioned in step 3:\n1.5% = 0.015\n\nNow our equation becomes:\n30 = 0.015x\n\nThis sets us up for the next step, which will be to solve for x. The acting agent should use this equation to proceed with the calculation.\n",
