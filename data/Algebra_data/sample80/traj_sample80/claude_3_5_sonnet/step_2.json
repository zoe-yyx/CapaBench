    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equation:\n   - Understand that we have $5xy = 20$\n\n2. Isolate xy:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get $xy = 4$\n\n3. Relate the given equation to the target expression:\n   - Recognize that $25x^2y^2$ is related to $(xy)^2$\n\n4. Square both sides of the isolated equation:\n   - $(xy)^2 = 4^2 = 16$\n\n5. Connect the squared result to the target expression:\n   - Realize that $25x^2y^2 = 25 * (xy)^2$\n\n6. Calculate the final result:\n   - Multiply 25 by the result from step 4: $25 * 16$\n\n7. Provide the final answer:\n   - State the value of $25x^2y^2$\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit, using basic algebraic manipulations and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and current progress, we have successfully isolated xy = 4 and squared both sides to get (xy)^2 = 4^2 = 16. This is a crucial step in our solution process.\n\nNow, we need to connect this result to our target expression 25x^2y^2. We can reason as follows:\n\n1. We know that (xy)^2 = 16\n2. Our target expression is 25x^2y^2\n3. We can rewrite 25x^2y^2 as 25 * (xy)^2\n\nGiven these points, our next logical step is to multiply 25 by the value we found for (xy)^2, which is 16.\n\nThis multiplication will give us the final value for 25x^2y^2, completing our solution process.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to use a calculator to multiply 25 by 16.\n",
