    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equation:\n   - Understand that we have $5xy = 20$\n\n2. Isolate xy:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get $xy = 4$\n\n3. Relate the given equation to the target expression:\n   - Recognize that $25x^2y^2$ is related to $(xy)^2$\n\n4. Square both sides of the isolated equation:\n   - $(xy)^2 = 4^2 = 16$\n\n5. Connect the squared result to the target expression:\n   - Realize that $25x^2y^2 = 25 * (xy)^2$\n\n6. Calculate the final result:\n   - Multiply 25 by the result from step 4: $25 * 16$\n\n7. Provide the final answer:\n   - State the value of $25x^2y^2$\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit, using basic algebraic manipulations and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action taken, we have successfully isolated xy to get xy = 4. The next logical step in our reasoning process is to relate this to the target expression 25x^2y^2.\n\nWe can observe that 25x^2y^2 can be rewritten as 25(xy)^2. This means we need to square the value of xy that we've found and then multiply it by 25.\n\nOur reasoning suggests that the next operation should be to square both sides of the equation xy = 4. This will give us (xy)^2 = 4^2, which is a crucial step in solving for 25x^2y^2.\n\nAfter this step, we'll be in a position to directly calculate the final result by multiplying the squared value by 25.\n",
