    "observation": "Mrs. Smith invests 2000 dollars in an account that compounds annually at a constant interest rate. After five years, her investment has grown to 3220 dollars. What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage? (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components of the problem:\n   - Initial investment: $2000\n   - Final amount: $3220\n   - Time period: 5 years\n   - Compound interest: Annual\n   - Goal: Find the annual interest rate as a percentage\n\n2. Recall the compound interest formula:\n   A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where:\n   A = Final amount\n   P = Principal (initial investment)\n   r = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)\n   t = Number of years\n\n3. Plug in the known values:\n   3220 = 2000(1 + r)^5\n\n4. Solve for r:\n   a) Divide both sides by 2000\n   b) Take the 5th root of both sides\n   c) Subtract 1 from both sides\n   d) Convert the decimal to a percentage\n\n5. Use a calculator to perform the calculations in step 4\n\n6. Round the result to the nearest integer\n\n7. Verify the answer by plugging it back into the original equation\n\n8. Present the final answer as a percentage\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations, we now have the annual interest rate as a percentage, which is ((1.61)^(1/5) - 1) * 100. To complete our solution, we need to guide the acting agent through the following steps:\n\n1. Round the percentage to the nearest integer:\n   We need to take the result of ((1.61)^(1/5) - 1) * 100 and round it to the nearest whole number.\n\n2. Verify the answer:\n   Once we have the rounded percentage, we should plug it back into the original compound interest formula to ensure it gives us a result close to $3220.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these steps:\n\n1. Round the result of ((1.61)^(1/5) - 1) * 100 to the nearest integer.\n\n2. Convert the rounded percentage back to a decimal (divide by 100) and use it in the formula:\n   2000 * (1 + r)^5, where r is the rounded percentage as a decimal.\n\n3. Check if the result is close to $3220.\n\nThis reasoning will help the acting agent finalize the calculation and verify the answer. The rounded percentage will be our final answer for the annual interest rate.\n",
