    "observation": "Mrs. Smith invests 2000 dollars in an account that compounds annually at a constant interest rate. After five years, her investment has grown to 3220 dollars. What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage? (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components of the problem:\n   - Initial investment: $2000\n   - Final amount: $3220\n   - Time period: 5 years\n   - Compound interest: Annual\n   - Goal: Find the annual interest rate as a percentage\n\n2. Recall the compound interest formula:\n   A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where:\n   A = Final amount\n   P = Principal (initial investment)\n   r = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)\n   t = Number of years\n\n3. Plug in the known values:\n   3220 = 2000(1 + r)^5\n\n4. Solve for r:\n   a) Divide both sides by 2000\n   b) Take the 5th root of both sides\n   c) Subtract 1 from both sides\n   d) Convert the decimal to a percentage\n\n5. Use a calculator to perform the calculations in step 4\n\n6. Round the result to the nearest integer\n\n7. Verify the answer by plugging it back into the original equation\n\n8. Present the final answer as a percentage\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations and rounding, we now have the annual interest rate as a rounded percentage. To finalize our solution and verify the answer, we need to guide the acting agent through the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the rounded percentage back to a decimal:\n   We need to take the rounded result (which should be a whole number) and divide it by 100 to get the decimal form of the interest rate.\n\n2. Use the decimal in the original compound interest formula:\n   We'll use the formula A = P(1 + r)^t, where:\n   A = 3220 (final amount)\n   P = 2000 (initial investment)\n   r = the rounded percentage divided by 100 (decimal form)\n   t = 5 (years)\n\n3. Calculate the result and compare it to the expected final amount:\n   The result should be close to $3220. If it is, we've verified our answer.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these steps:\n\n1. Divide the rounded percentage by 100 to get the decimal form of the interest rate.\n2. Use this decimal in the formula: 2000 * (1 + r)^5\n3. Calculate the result and compare it to $3220.\n\nThis reasoning will help the acting agent verify the answer and ensure that our calculated interest rate is correct. If the verification is successful, we can confidently present the rounded percentage as our final answer for the annual interest rate.\n",
