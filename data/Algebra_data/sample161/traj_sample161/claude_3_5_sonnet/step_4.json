    "observation": "Mrs. Smith invests 2000 dollars in an account that compounds annually at a constant interest rate. After five years, her investment has grown to 3220 dollars. What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage? (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components of the problem:\n   - Initial investment: $2000\n   - Final amount: $3220\n   - Time period: 5 years\n   - Compound interest: Annual\n   - Goal: Find the annual interest rate as a percentage\n\n2. Recall the compound interest formula:\n   A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where:\n   A = Final amount\n   P = Principal (initial investment)\n   r = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)\n   t = Number of years\n\n3. Plug in the known values:\n   3220 = 2000(1 + r)^5\n\n4. Solve for r:\n   a) Divide both sides by 2000\n   b) Take the 5th root of both sides\n   c) Subtract 1 from both sides\n   d) Convert the decimal to a percentage\n\n5. Use a calculator to perform the calculations in step 4\n\n6. Round the result to the nearest integer\n\n7. Verify the answer by plugging it back into the original equation\n\n8. Present the final answer as a percentage\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations and actions, we have successfully determined the annual interest rate and verified it. Let's summarize our findings and conclude the problem-solving process:\n\n1. We calculated the interest rate as ((1.61)^(1/5) - 1) * 100 and rounded it to the nearest integer.\n\n2. We then used this rounded percentage to verify our answer by plugging it back into the original compound interest formula.\n\n3. The verification calculation was: 2000 * (1 + \\round(((1.61)^(1/5) - 1) * 100) / 100)^5\n\nNow, we need to interpret these results to provide the final answer. Here's what we should do next:\n\n1. Determine the exact value of the rounded percentage (which should be a whole number).\n\n2. Compare the result of our verification calculation to the expected final amount of $3220.\n\n3. If the verification result is close to $3220 (allowing for small rounding errors), we can confirm that our calculated interest rate is correct.\n\n4. Present the rounded percentage as the final answer to the problem.\n\nThe acting agent should now:\n\n1. Report the rounded percentage (whole number) that represents the annual interest rate.\n2. Report the result of the verification calculation to confirm its accuracy.\n\nThis will allow us to state the final answer with confidence and show that it satisfies the conditions given in the original problem.\n",
