    "observation": "Mrs. Smith invests 2000 dollars in an account that compounds annually at a constant interest rate. After five years, her investment has grown to 3220 dollars. What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage? (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components of the problem:\n   - Initial investment: $2000\n   - Final amount: $3220\n   - Time period: 5 years\n   - Compound interest: Annual\n   - Goal: Find the annual interest rate as a percentage\n\n2. Recall the compound interest formula:\n   A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where:\n   A = Final amount\n   P = Principal (initial investment)\n   r = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)\n   t = Number of years\n\n3. Plug in the known values:\n   3220 = 2000(1 + r)^5\n\n4. Solve for r:\n   a) Divide both sides by 2000\n   b) Take the 5th root of both sides\n   c) Subtract 1 from both sides\n   d) Convert the decimal to a percentage\n\n5. Use a calculator to perform the calculations in step 4\n\n6. Round the result to the nearest integer\n\n7. Verify the answer by plugging it back into the original equation\n\n8. Present the final answer as a percentage\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we need to guide the acting agent through the process of solving for the annual interest rate using the compound interest formula. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We have the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where A = 3220, P = 2000, t = 5, and we need to solve for r.\n\n2. Let's rearrange the equation to isolate r:\n   3220 = 2000(1 + r)^5\n   3220/2000 = (1 + r)^5\n   1.61 = (1 + r)^5\n\n3. To solve for r, we need to:\n   a) Take the 5th root of both sides\n   b) Subtract 1 from the result\n   c) Convert to a percentage\n\n4. The acting agent should use a calculator to:\n   a) Calculate the 5th root of 1.61\n   b) Subtract 1 from the result\n   c) Multiply by 100 to get the percentage\n\n5. After getting the result, round it to the nearest integer.\n\n6. Finally, verify the answer by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nThis reasoning will guide the acting agent to perform the necessary calculations to find the annual interest rate.\n",
