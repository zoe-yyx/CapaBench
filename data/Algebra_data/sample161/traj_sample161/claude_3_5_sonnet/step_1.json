    "observation": "Mrs. Smith invests 2000 dollars in an account that compounds annually at a constant interest rate. After five years, her investment has grown to 3220 dollars. What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage? (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key components of the problem:\n   - Initial investment: $2000\n   - Final amount: $3220\n   - Time period: 5 years\n   - Compound interest: Annual\n   - Goal: Find the annual interest rate as a percentage\n\n2. Recall the compound interest formula:\n   A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where:\n   A = Final amount\n   P = Principal (initial investment)\n   r = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)\n   t = Number of years\n\n3. Plug in the known values:\n   3220 = 2000(1 + r)^5\n\n4. Solve for r:\n   a) Divide both sides by 2000\n   b) Take the 5th root of both sides\n   c) Subtract 1 from both sides\n   d) Convert the decimal to a percentage\n\n5. Use a calculator to perform the calculations in step 4\n\n6. Round the result to the nearest integer\n\n7. Verify the answer by plugging it back into the original equation\n\n8. Present the final answer as a percentage\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation, we now have the value (1.61)^(1/5) - 1, which represents the annual interest rate in decimal form. To complete our solution, we need to guide the acting agent through the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the decimal to a percentage:\n   We need to multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n2. Round to the nearest integer:\n   After converting to a percentage, we should round the result to the nearest whole number.\n\n3. Verify the answer:\n   Once we have the rounded percentage, we should plug it back into the original compound interest formula to ensure it gives us a result close to $3220.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these steps:\n\n1. Multiply the previous result ((1.61)^(1/5) - 1) by 100 to get the percentage.\n2. Round this percentage to the nearest integer.\n3. Convert the rounded percentage back to a decimal (divide by 100) and use it in the formula:\n   2000 * (1 + r)^5, where r is the rounded percentage as a decimal.\n4. Check if the result is close to $3220.\n\nThis reasoning will help the acting agent complete the calculation and verify the answer.\n",
