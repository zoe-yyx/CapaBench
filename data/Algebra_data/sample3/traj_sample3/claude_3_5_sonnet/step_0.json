Understand the problem:\n   We need to calculate i^3, which means i multiplied by itself three times\n\n3. Apply the properties of exponents:\n   i^3 = i * i * i\n\n4. Break down the calculation:\n   Step 1: Calculate i * i (which equals -1)\n   Step 2: Multiply the result by i\n\n5. Perform the final calculation:\n   (-1) * i\n\n6. Simplify and present the final answer:\n   The result should be -i\n\nThis problem can be solved without a calculator or search engine, as it involves basic properties of complex numbers and exponents. The acting agent should be able to carry out these steps mentally or with simple written calculations.\n",
