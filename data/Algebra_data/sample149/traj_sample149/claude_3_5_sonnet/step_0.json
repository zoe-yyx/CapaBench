    "observation": "At a bakery, there are three types of pastries: croissants, muffins, and scones. On a particular day, the total number of pastries is 400. If the number of muffins and scones together is three times the number of croissants, and there are 20 more muffins than scones, find the number of croissants.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify and define variables:\n   Let x = number of croissants\n   Let y = number of muffins\n   Let z = number of scones\n\n2. List the given conditions:\n   - Total pastries = 400\n   - Muffins + Scones = 3 \u00d7 Croissants\n   - Muffins = Scones + 20\n\n3. Set up equations based on the conditions:\n   Equation 1: x + y + z = 400\n   Equation 2: y + z = 3x\n   Equation 3: y = z + 20\n\n4. Solve for z in terms of x using Equation 3:\n   z = y - 20\n\n5. Substitute z in Equation 2:\n   y + (y - 20) = 3x\n   2y - 20 = 3x\n\n6. Solve for y in terms of x:\n   2y = 3x + 20\n   y = (3x + 20) / 2\n\n7. Substitute the expressions for y and z into Equation 1:\n   x + (3x + 20) / 2 + ((3x + 20) / 2 - 20) = 400\n\n8. Simplify and solve for x:\n   - Combine like terms\n   - Isolate x on one side of the equation\n   - Solve for x (number of croissants)\n\n9. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate y and z using the found value of x\n   - Check if all initial conditions are satisfied\n\n10. Present the final answer: number of croissants (x)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the equations that represent the given conditions. The first step is to express these equations using our defined variables:\n\n1. Total pastries equation: x + y + z = 400\n2. Muffins and scones relation to croissants: y + z = 3x\n3. Relation between muffins and scones: y = z + 20\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations to find the number of croissants (x). Let's follow the plan:\n\n1. From equation 3, we can express z in terms of y: z = y - 20\n2. Substitute this into equation 2: y + (y - 20) = 3x\n3. Simplify: 2y - 20 = 3x\n4. Solve for y in terms of x: y = (3x + 20) / 2\n\nNow we have expressions for both y and z in terms of x. The next logical step is to substitute these into the total pastries equation (equation 1) and solve for x.\n\nThe acting agent should now use these expressions to form a single equation with x as the only variable, then solve it to find the number of croissants.\n",
