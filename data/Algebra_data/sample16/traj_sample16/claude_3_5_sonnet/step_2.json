Substitute the values into the function:\n   - Replace x with 5 and y with -2 in the original function\n\n4. Evaluate the expression:\n   - Calculate 3(5) - 4(-2) + 5(-2)\n   - This will involve multiplication and addition/subtraction\n\n5. Simplify and compute the final result:\n   - Perform the calculations step by step\n   - Use a calculator if needed for precise computation\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy\n\n7. Present the final value of f(5, -2)\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We have correctly calculated the value of f(5, -2) to be 13.\n\n2. The calculation process was accurate:\n   3(5) = 15\n   -4(-2) = 8\n   5(-2) = -10\n   15 + 8 - 10 = 13\n\n3. However, we made an error in presenting the final answer by including unnecessary notation.\n\n4. For the correct response, we should provide only the numerical result without any additional context or function notation.\n\n5. Therefore, the acting agent should be instructed to present the final answer as simply \"13\".\n\n6. To ensure accuracy, the acting agent should double-check this value using a calculator one last time before submitting the answer.\n\n7. The acting agent should be reminded that for future problems, the final answer should always be presented as a standalone numerical value, without any additional notation or context.\n",
