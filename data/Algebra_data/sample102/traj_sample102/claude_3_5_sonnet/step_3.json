    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for multiplying complex numbers:\n   (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\n2. Identify the components of our complex numbers:\n   (4 + 3i) and (2 - 5i)\n   a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = -5\n\n3. Apply the multiplication formula:\n   - Calculate ac: 4 * 2\n   - Calculate bd: 3 * (-5)\n   - Calculate ad: 4 * (-5)\n   - Calculate bc: 3 * 2\n\n4. Combine the real parts:\n   ac - bd\n\n5. Combine the imaginary parts:\n   (ad + bc)i\n\n6. Simplify and present the final answer in the form a + bi\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the arithmetic operations if needed.\n",

Let's review what we have so far:\n\n1. ac = 4 * 2 = 8\n2. bd = 3 * (-5) = -15\n3. ad = 4 * (-5) = -20\n\nWe've already determined that the real part of our answer is:\nac - bd = 8 - (-15) = 23\n\nFor the imaginary part, we still need to calculate the last component:\n4. bc = 3 * 2\n\nOnce we have this, we can complete the imaginary part calculation (ad + bc)i.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the calculator to compute bc = 3 * 2. After this calculation, we'll have all the components needed to form our final complex number answer.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be ready to combine all parts and express our final answer in the form a + bi.\n",
