    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for multiplying complex numbers:\n   (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\n2. Identify the components of our complex numbers:\n   (4 + 3i) and (2 - 5i)\n   a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = -5\n\n3. Apply the multiplication formula:\n   - Calculate ac: 4 * 2\n   - Calculate bd: 3 * (-5)\n   - Calculate ad: 4 * (-5)\n   - Calculate bc: 3 * 2\n\n4. Combine the real parts:\n   ac - bd\n\n5. Combine the imaginary parts:\n   (ad + bc)i\n\n6. Simplify and present the final answer in the form a + bi\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the arithmetic operations if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nExcellent! We now have all the components needed to form our final complex number. Let's review what we've calculated:\n\n1. ac = 4 * 2 = 8\n2. bd = 3 * (-5) = -15\n3. ad = 4 * (-5) = -20\n4. bc = 3 * 2 = 6\n\nWe've already determined the real part:\nac - bd = 8 - (-15) = 23\n\nNow, let's focus on the imaginary part:\nad + bc = -20 + 6 = -14\n\nOur final answer will be in the form (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n\nSo, we can now combine these results to form our final complex number:\n23 + (-14)i\n\nThe next step should be to simplify this expression by combining like terms. In this case, we just need to simplify the coefficient of i.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should write out the final answer as:\n23 - 14i\n\nThis completes our multiplication of (4 + 3i) and (2 - 5i).\n",
