Identify the components of our complex numbers:\n   (4 + 3i) and (2 - 5i)\n   a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = -5\n\n3. Apply the multiplication formula:\n   - Calculate ac: 4 * 2\n   - Calculate bd: 3 * (-5)\n   - Calculate ad: 4 * (-5)\n   - Calculate bc: 3 * 2\n\n4. Combine the real parts:\n   ac - bd\n\n5. Combine the imaginary parts:\n   (ad + bc)i\n\n6. Simplify and present the final answer in the form a + bi\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the arithmetic operations if needed.\n",
