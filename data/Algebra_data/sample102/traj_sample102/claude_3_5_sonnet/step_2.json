Identify the components of our complex numbers:\n   (4 + 3i) and (2 - 5i)\n   a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = -5\n\n3. Apply the multiplication formula:\n   - Calculate ac: 4 * 2\n   - Calculate bd: 3 * (-5)\n   - Calculate ad: 4 * (-5)\n   - Calculate bc: 3 * 2\n\n4. Combine the real parts:\n   ac - bd\n\n5. Combine the imaginary parts:\n   (ad + bc)i\n\n6. Simplify and present the final answer in the form a + bi\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the arithmetic operations if needed.\n",

We have calculated two important components:\n\n1. ac = 4 * 2 = 8\n2. bd = 3 * (-5) = -15\n\nNow we can determine the real part of our final complex number:\nac - bd = 8 - (-15) = 8 + 15 = 23\n\nThis gives us the real part of our answer. \n\nFor the next step, we need to focus on the imaginary part. We still need to calculate:\n3. ad = 4 * (-5)\n4. bc = 3 * 2\n\nLet's proceed with calculating ad = 4 * (-5). This will give us one of the two components needed for the imaginary part of our final answer.\n\nThe acting agent should use the calculator to compute 4 * (-5).\n",
