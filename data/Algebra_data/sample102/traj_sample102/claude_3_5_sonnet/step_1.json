Identify the components of our complex numbers:\n   (4 + 3i) and (2 - 5i)\n   a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = -5\n\n3. Apply the multiplication formula:\n   - Calculate ac: 4 * 2\n   - Calculate bd: 3 * (-5)\n   - Calculate ad: 4 * (-5)\n   - Calculate bc: 3 * 2\n\n4. Combine the real parts:\n   ac - bd\n\n5. Combine the imaginary parts:\n   (ad + bc)i\n\n6. Simplify and present the final answer in the form a + bi\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for the arithmetic operations if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGreat start! We've calculated the first component, ac = 4 * 2 = 8. Now, let's continue with the remaining calculations as per our plan.\n\nThe next step is to calculate bd = 3 * (-5). This is crucial because we need both ac and bd to determine the real part of our final complex number (ac - bd).\n\nAfter that, we'll need to calculate ad = 4 * (-5) and bc = 3 * 2. These components will be used to determine the imaginary part of our final complex number (ad + bc)i.\n\nSo, the next logical step is to use the calculator to compute bd = 3 * (-5). This will give us the second component needed for the real part of our answer.\n\nOnce we have this result, we'll be halfway through our calculations and can then move on to computing the components for the imaginary part.\n",
