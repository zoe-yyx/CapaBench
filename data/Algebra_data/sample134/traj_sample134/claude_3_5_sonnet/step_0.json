    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given quadratic equation:\n   - Identify the general form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   - Note that a = 1, c = 36, and b is unknown\n\n2. Recall Vieta's formulas for quadratic equations:\n   - Sum of roots: p + q = -b/a\n   - Product of roots: pq = c/a\n\n3. Expand the expression (x-p)^2 + (x-q)^2:\n   - Use the formula (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n   - Combine like terms\n\n4. Compare the expanded expression with the given simplified form:\n   - 2x^2 + 40x + 328\n\n5. Use the coefficients comparison to set up equations:\n   - Compare x^2 terms\n   - Compare x terms\n   - Compare constant terms\n\n6. Utilize Vieta's formulas to substitute known relationships:\n   - Replace p + q with -b\n   - Replace p^2 + q^2 with (p+q)^2 - 2pq = b^2 - 2(36)\n\n7. Solve the resulting equation for b:\n   - Simplify and isolate b\n\n8. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of b back into the original equation\n   - Check if it satisfies all given conditions\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of b\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by expanding the expression (x-p)^2 + (x-q)^2 and comparing it with the given simplified form. This will allow us to set up equations using the coefficients.\n\nLet's expand (x-p)^2 + (x-q)^2:\n(x-p)^2 + (x-q)^2 = (x^2 - 2px + p^2) + (x^2 - 2qx + q^2)\n                  = 2x^2 - 2(p+q)x + (p^2 + q^2)\n\nNow, we can compare this with the given simplified form:\n2x^2 - 2(p+q)x + (p^2 + q^2) = 2x^2 + 40x + 328\n\nComparing coefficients:\n1. The x^2 terms match (2x^2 on both sides)\n2. For the x term: -2(p+q) = 40\n3. For the constant term: p^2 + q^2 = 328\n\nFrom step 2, we can deduce: p + q = -20\n\nNow, let's use Vieta's formulas:\np + q = -b (since a = 1 in the original equation)\n\nTherefore, b = 20\n\nTo verify this, we should substitute b = 20 into the original equation and check if it satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to verify this value of b by substituting it into the original equation and checking if it satisfies all given conditions.\n",
