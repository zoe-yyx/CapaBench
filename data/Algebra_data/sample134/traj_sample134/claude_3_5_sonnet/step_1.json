    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given quadratic equation:\n   - Identify the general form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   - Note that a = 1, c = 36, and b is unknown\n\n2. Recall Vieta's formulas for quadratic equations:\n   - Sum of roots: p + q = -b/a\n   - Product of roots: pq = c/a\n\n3. Expand the expression (x-p)^2 + (x-q)^2:\n   - Use the formula (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n   - Combine like terms\n\n4. Compare the expanded expression with the given simplified form:\n   - 2x^2 + 40x + 328\n\n5. Use the coefficients comparison to set up equations:\n   - Compare x^2 terms\n   - Compare x terms\n   - Compare constant terms\n\n6. Utilize Vieta's formulas to substitute known relationships:\n   - Replace p + q with -b\n   - Replace p^2 + q^2 with (p+q)^2 - 2pq = b^2 - 2(36)\n\n7. Solve the resulting equation for b:\n   - Simplify and isolate b\n\n8. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of b back into the original equation\n   - Check if it satisfies all given conditions\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of b\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation and our reasoning, we've determined that b = 20. Now, we need to verify this solution by checking if it satisfies all the given conditions. Let's guide the acting agent through this verification process:\n\n1. First, we should substitute b = 20 into the original equation:\n   x^2 + 20x + 36 = 0\n\n2. We need to find the roots of this equation to verify if they match the conditions. We can use the quadratic formula:\n   x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n   \n   We've already calculated one root: -2\n\n3. We should calculate the other root as well:\n   x = (-20 + \u221a(20^2 - 4*1*36)) / (2*1)\n\n4. Once we have both roots, we can verify if they satisfy the condition:\n   (x-p)^2 + (x-q)^2 = 2x^2 + 40x + 328\n\n5. If this equality holds true for any value of x, it will confirm that our solution b = 20 is correct.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute the second root and then verify the equality mentioned in step 4.\n",
