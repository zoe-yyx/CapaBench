    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given quadratic equation:\n   - Identify the general form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   - Note that a = 1, c = 36, and b is unknown\n\n2. Recall Vieta's formulas for quadratic equations:\n   - Sum of roots: p + q = -b/a\n   - Product of roots: pq = c/a\n\n3. Expand the expression (x-p)^2 + (x-q)^2:\n   - Use the formula (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n   - Combine like terms\n\n4. Compare the expanded expression with the given simplified form:\n   - 2x^2 + 40x + 328\n\n5. Use the coefficients comparison to set up equations:\n   - Compare x^2 terms\n   - Compare x terms\n   - Compare constant terms\n\n6. Utilize Vieta's formulas to substitute known relationships:\n   - Replace p + q with -b\n   - Replace p^2 + q^2 with (p+q)^2 - 2pq = b^2 - 2(36)\n\n7. Solve the resulting equation for b:\n   - Simplify and isolate b\n\n8. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of b back into the original equation\n   - Check if it satisfies all given conditions\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of b\n",
