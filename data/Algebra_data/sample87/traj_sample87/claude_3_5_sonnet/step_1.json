    "planning_context": "\nPlan to rationalize the denominator of $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$:\n\n1. Understand the concept:\n   - Rationalizing the denominator means eliminating any radicals (square roots) from the denominator of a fraction.\n\n2. Identify the method:\n   - For a denominator with a single square root, multiply both numerator and denominator by that square root.\n\n3. Set up the multiplication:\n   - Multiply $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$ by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   - Multiply numerators: 5 \u00d7 \u221a3\n   - Multiply denominators: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Simplify the numerator (5\u221a3)\n   - Simplify the denominator (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = 3)\n\n6. Write the final answer:\n   - Express the result as a single fraction with a rationalized denominator\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check that the denominator no longer contains a square root\n   - Ensure the fraction is equivalent to the original\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct rationalization of the denominator within a few steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe previous action correctly set up the multiplication to rationalize the denominator. Now, we need to perform this multiplication and simplify the result. The next logical steps are:\n\n1. Multiply the numerators: 5 \u00d7 \u221a3\n2. Multiply the denominators: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3\n3. Simplify the denominator\n\nThis will lead us to a fraction where the denominator no longer contains a square root. The numerator will contain a \u221a3, but that's acceptable as our goal is to rationalize the denominator.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on performing these multiplications and simplifications. They may need to use a calculator for the multiplication in the denominator (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = 3) if they're unsure about this property of square roots.\n",
