    "planning_context": "\nPlan to rationalize the denominator of $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$:\n\n1. Understand the concept:\n   - Rationalizing the denominator means eliminating any radicals (square roots) from the denominator of a fraction.\n\n2. Identify the method:\n   - For a denominator with a single square root, multiply both numerator and denominator by that square root.\n\n3. Set up the multiplication:\n   - Multiply $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$ by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   - Multiply numerators: 5 \u00d7 \u221a3\n   - Multiply denominators: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Simplify the numerator (5\u221a3)\n   - Simplify the denominator (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = 3)\n\n6. Write the final answer:\n   - Express the result as a single fraction with a rationalized denominator\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check that the denominator no longer contains a square root\n   - Ensure the fraction is equivalent to the original\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct rationalization of the denominator within a few steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions, we've successfully multiplied the original fraction by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and simplified the numerator to 5\u221a3. The next logical step in our rationalization process is to focus on the denominator.\n\nWe need to multiply the denominators: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3. This is a crucial step because it will eliminate the square root in the denominator, which is the main goal of rationalizing.\n\nWhen we multiply \u221a3 by itself, we get 3. This is because \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = (\u221a3)\u00b2 = 3.\n\nAfter this step, we'll have a fraction with 5\u221a3 in the numerator and 3 in the denominator, which will complete the rationalization process.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on simplifying the denominator by multiplying \u221a3 by \u221a3.\n",
