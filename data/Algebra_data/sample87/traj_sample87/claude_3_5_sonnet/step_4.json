    "planning_context": "\nPlan to rationalize the denominator of $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$:\n\n1. Understand the concept:\n   - Rationalizing the denominator means eliminating any radicals (square roots) from the denominator of a fraction.\n\n2. Identify the method:\n   - For a denominator with a single square root, multiply both numerator and denominator by that square root.\n\n3. Set up the multiplication:\n   - Multiply $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$ by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   - Multiply numerators: 5 \u00d7 \u221a3\n   - Multiply denominators: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Simplify the numerator (5\u221a3)\n   - Simplify the denominator (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = 3)\n\n6. Write the final answer:\n   - Express the result as a single fraction with a rationalized denominator\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check that the denominator no longer contains a square root\n   - Ensure the fraction is equivalent to the original\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct rationalization of the denominator within a few steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our plan, we have successfully rationalized the denominator. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We started with $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n2. We multiplied by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n3. We simplified the numerator to 5\u221a3\n4. We calculated the denominator: \u221a3 * \u221a3 = 3\n\nNow, we have the fraction in the form $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. This is the rationalized form we were aiming for. The denominator no longer contains a square root, which was our main goal.\n\nThe next logical step is to express this as our final answer. We should guide the acting agent to write out the rationalized fraction in its simplest form.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this fraction cannot be simplified further:\n- The numerator (5\u221a3) cannot be simplified as 5 and \u221a3 have no common factors.\n- The denominator (3) is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ is our final, simplified answer.\n",
