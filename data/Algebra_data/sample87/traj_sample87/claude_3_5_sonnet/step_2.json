    "planning_context": "\nPlan to rationalize the denominator of $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$:\n\n1. Understand the concept:\n   - Rationalizing the denominator means eliminating any radicals (square roots) from the denominator of a fraction.\n\n2. Identify the method:\n   - For a denominator with a single square root, multiply both numerator and denominator by that square root.\n\n3. Set up the multiplication:\n   - Multiply $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$ by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   - Multiply numerators: 5 \u00d7 \u221a3\n   - Multiply denominators: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Simplify the numerator (5\u221a3)\n   - Simplify the denominator (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = 3)\n\n6. Write the final answer:\n   - Express the result as a single fraction with a rationalized denominator\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check that the denominator no longer contains a square root\n   - Ensure the fraction is equivalent to the original\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct rationalization of the denominator within a few steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions taken, we've made good progress in rationalizing the denominator of $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Let's analyze the current state and determine the next critical step:\n\n1. We've correctly set up the multiplication by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$, which is the key to rationalizing the denominator.\n\n2. The next logical step is to carry out the multiplication and simplification. This involves:\n\n   a) In the numerator: Multiplying 5 by $\\sqrt{3}$\n   b) In the denominator: Multiplying $\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3}$\n\n3. For the numerator, the result will be $5\\sqrt{3}$, which cannot be simplified further.\n\n4. For the denominator, we need to recognize that $\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3$. This step is crucial as it eliminates the square root from the denominator, which is our main goal.\n\n5. After these calculations, we should have a fraction with $5\\sqrt{3}$ in the numerator and 3 in the denominator.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on performing these calculations accurately, ensuring that the square root is eliminated from the denominator while maintaining the equality of the fraction.\n",
