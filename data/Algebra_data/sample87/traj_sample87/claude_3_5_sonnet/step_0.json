Understand the concept:\n   - Rationalizing the denominator means eliminating any radicals (square roots) from the denominator of a fraction.\n\n2. Identify the method:\n   - For a denominator with a single square root, multiply both numerator and denominator by that square root.\n\n3. Set up the multiplication:\n   - Multiply $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$ by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   - Multiply numerators: 5 \u00d7 \u221a3\n   - Multiply denominators: \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Simplify the numerator (5\u221a3)\n   - Simplify the denominator (\u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = 3)\n\n6. Write the final answer:\n   - Express the result as a single fraction with a rationalized denominator\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check that the denominator no longer contains a square root\n   - Ensure the fraction is equivalent to the original\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct rationalization of the denominator within a few steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we're at the beginning of the problem-solving process, we should start with the first actionable step in our plan. The key operation at this point is to set up the multiplication that will rationalize the denominator.\n\nOur reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. We need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by \u221a3. This is because \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 = 3, which will eliminate the square root in the denominator.\n\n2. This operation can be represented as multiplying the original fraction by the fraction \u221a3/\u221a3, which equals 1 and thus doesn't change the value of the original fraction.\n\n3. Setting up this multiplication will allow us to proceed with the actual calculation in the next step.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to express the fraction $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$ multiplied by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$. This setup is crucial for the rationalization process and will enable us to move forward with the simplification in subsequent steps.\n",
