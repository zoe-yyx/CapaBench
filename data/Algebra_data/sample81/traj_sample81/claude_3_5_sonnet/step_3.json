The result is positive, which makes sense because g(3) was larger than g(2).\n2. The difference of 6 seems reasonable for a quadratic function over this interval.\n3. We can double-check our calculations by plugging the values back into the original function:\n\n   g(3) = 2(3)^2 - 4(3) + 3 = 18 - 12 + 3 = 9\n   g(2) = 2(2)^2 - 4(2) + 3 = 8 - 8 + 3 = 3\n\n   9 - 3 = 6, which confirms our result.\n\nGiven this verification, we can confidently state that our solution is correct.
