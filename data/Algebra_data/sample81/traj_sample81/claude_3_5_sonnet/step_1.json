Calculate g(3):\n   - Substitute x with 3 in the original function\n   - Perform the calculation step by step\n\n3. Calculate g(2):\n   - Substitute x with 2 in the original function\n   - Perform the calculation step by step\n\n4. Subtract g(2) from g(3):\n   - Use the results from steps 2 and 3\n   - Perform the final subtraction\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the final answer makes sense in the context of a quadratic function\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we have successfully calculated g(3), which equals 9. This completes step 2 of our plan. Now, we need to move on to step 3, which is calculating g(2).\n\nTo calculate g(2), we need to follow a similar process as we did for g(3):\n\n1. We need to substitute x with 2 in the original function: g(2) = 2(2)^2 - 4(2) + 3\n2. This will give us: g(2) = 2(4) - 8 + 3\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation accurately. This will give us the value of g(2), which is the second part of our solution.\n\nAfter calculating g(2), we will be ready to move to step 4 of our plan, which is subtracting g(2) from g(3) to get our final answer.\n",
