Calculate g(3):\n   - Substitute x with 3 in the original function\n   - Perform the calculation step by step\n\n3. Calculate g(2):\n   - Substitute x with 2 in the original function\n   - Perform the calculation step by step\n\n4. Subtract g(2) from g(3):\n   - Use the results from steps 2 and 3\n   - Perform the final subtraction\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the final answer makes sense in the context of a quadratic function\n",
