Calculate g(2):\n   - Substitute x with 2 in the original function\n   - Perform the calculation step by step\n\n4. Subtract g(2) from g(3):\n   - Use the results from steps 2 and 3\n   - Perform the final subtraction\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the final answer makes sense in the context of a quadratic function\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the plan step by step. The first action should be to calculate g(3). This involves substituting x with 3 in the original function g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this calculation:\n\n1. Replace x with 3 in the function: g(3) = 2(3)^2 - 4(3) + 3\n2. Calculate the squared term: 3^2 = 9\n3. Multiply: 2 * 9 = 18\n4. Multiply: -4 * 3 = -12\n5. Add all terms: 18 - 12 + 3\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations accurately. This will give us the value of g(3), which is the first part of our solution.\n\nAfter this, we'll move on to calculating g(2) in a similar manner.\n",
