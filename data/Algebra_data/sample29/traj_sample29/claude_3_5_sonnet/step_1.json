We can now move to step 5 of our strategy: verifying the result. Although the calculation seems straightforward and correct, it's always good practice to double-check.\n\n5. After verification, we can proceed to step 6: presenting the final answer.\n\nGiven this reasoning, our next guidance to the acting agent should be to:\n\n1. Verify the calculation by rechecking the steps:\n   $5 \\diamond 4 = 3(5) - 2(4) = 15 - 8 = 7$\n\n2.
