We have the definition of the operation: $x \\diamond y = 3x - 2y$ for all x and y.\n\n2.

Let's guide the acting agent to perform this substitution:\n   $5 \\diamond 4 = 3(5) - 2(4)$\n\n4. The next step would be to calculate this expression. We should instruct the acting agent to:\n   a) First calculate 3(5)\n   b) Then calculate 2(4)\n   c) Finally, subtract the result of (b) from (a)\n\n5. These calculations are simple enough that a basic calculator should suffice. There's no need for complex mathematical operations or additional information searches.\n\n6. After performing these calculations, we should have the final value of $5 \\diamond 4$, which will be our answer to the problem.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with steps 3 and 4 of our planning strategy and should lead us directly to the solution in the next action phase.\n",
