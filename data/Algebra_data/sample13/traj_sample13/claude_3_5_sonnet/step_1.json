Let's reason through the next steps:\n\n1. We have solved the first equation: $8^x = 64$, and found that x = 2.\n\n2. Now we can focus on the second equation: $9^x = y$\n\n3. Since we know the value of x, we can substitute it directly:\n   $9^2 = y$\n\n4. To find the value of y, we need to calculate $9^2$.\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate $9^2$. This is a straightforward calculation that the acting agent can perform using a calculator. Once we have this result, we will have solved for y and thus answered the original question.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to compute $9^2$. This will give us the final value of y, which is the answer to the problem.\n",
