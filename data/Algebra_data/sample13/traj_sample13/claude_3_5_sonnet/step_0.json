    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the problem, we should start by focusing on the first equation: $8^x = 64$. To solve for x, we can use logarithms. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. We know that $8^x = 64$\n2. We can take the logarithm (base 8) of both sides:\n   $\\log_8(8^x) = \\log_8(64)$\n3. Using the logarithm property $\\log_a(a^x) = x$, we get:\n   $x = \\log_8(64)$\n4. To calculate this, we can use the change of base formula:\n   $\\log_8(64) = \\frac{\\log(64)}{\\log(8)}$\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute $\\frac{\\log(64)}{\\log(8)}$. This will give us the value of x, which we can then use in the second equation to find y.\n",
