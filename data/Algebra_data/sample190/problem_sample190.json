    "solution": "The function $f(x)$ is undefined for values of $x$ that make the denominators zero, namely $x-7=0$, $x^2-49=0$, and $x^3-343=0$. Solving each, we get $x = 7$ from $x-7=0$, $x = 7$ or $x = -7$ from $x^2-49=0$, and $x = 7$ from $x^3-343=0$. Hence, the sum of all distinct real numbers making $f(x)$ undefined is $7 + (-7) = \\boxed{0}$, since $7$ is repeated and $-7$ is the only other distinct real number.",
