    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To solve the inequality $|2x - 3| \\leq 15$, we consider two cases: \n\n1. $2x - 3 \\leq 15$, solving this gives $2x \\leq 18$, hence $x \\leq 9$.\n2. $-(2x - 3) \\leq 15$, which simplifies to $2x - 3 \\geq -15$, and then $2x \\geq -12$, so $x \\geq -6$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we get $-6 \\leq x \\leq 9$. The integers satisfying this inequality range from $-6$ to $9$, inclusive. Thus, there are $9 - (-6) + 1 = 16$ integers in total. Therefore, the number of integer solutions is $\\boxed{16}$.",
