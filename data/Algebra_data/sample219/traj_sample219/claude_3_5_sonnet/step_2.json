We found that g^(-1)(4) = 8/3\n2. We then applied f^(-1) to this result: f^(-1)(8/3)\n3. The formula for f^(-1)(y) is 3 - y^2\n4. Substituting 8/3 for y gives us 3 - (8/3)^2, which is indeed -4.11111111111111\n\nThis result appears to be correct based on our algebraic manipulations and calculations. To further verify, we can suggest the acting agent to:\n\n1. Apply f to this result: f(-4.11111111111111) should be close to 8/3\n2. Apply g to 8/3: g(8/3) should be close to 4\n\nThese checks will confirm the correctness of our solution and complete the problem-solving process.\n",
