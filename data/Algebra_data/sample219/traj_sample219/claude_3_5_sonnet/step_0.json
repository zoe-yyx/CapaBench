    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to start by finding g^(-1)(4) as outlined in step 2 of our plan. Let's guide the acting agent through this process:\n\n1. We start with g(x) = x / (x - 2)\n2. To find g^(-1), we need to solve this equation for x in terms of y:\n   y = x / (x - 2)\n3. Cross-multiply:\n   y(x - 2) = x\n4. Distribute y:\n   yx - 2y = x\n5. Subtract x from both sides:\n   yx - x - 2y = 0\n6. Factor out x:\n   x(y - 1) = 2y\n7. Divide both sides by (y - 1):\n   x = 2y / (y - 1)\n\nThis gives us the general form of g^(-1)(y) = 2y / (y - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find g^(-1)(4) specifically. Let's substitute y = 4:\n\ng^(-1)(4) = 2(4) / (4 - 1) = 8 / 3\n\nThe acting agent should verify this calculation using a calculator if needed. This result, 8/3, will be crucial for the next steps in our solution.\n",
