    "observation": "A factory uses machines X, Y, and Z to produce two types of gadgets, A and B. Machine X can produce 5 gadgets of type A and 3 gadgets of type B per hour. Machine Y can produce 4 gadgets of type A and 7 gadgets of type B per hour. Machine Z can produce 2 gadgets of type A and 4 gadgets of type B per hour. If the factory has a total of 6 hours for all machines to operate and needs to produce 19 gadgets of type A and 29 gadgets of type B, how many hours should machine X operate?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Factory Production Problem:\n\n1. Identify and list the key variables:\n   - Machine X: 5A, 3B per hour\n   - Machine Y: 4A, 7B per hour\n   - Machine Z: 2A, 4B per hour\n   - Total operation time: 6 hours\n   - Required production: 19A, 29B\n\n2. Set up a system of linear equations:\n   Let x, y, z be the hours of operation for machines X, Y, Z respectively.\n   Equation 1: 5x + 4y + 2z = 19 (for type A gadgets)\n   Equation 2: 3x + 7y + 4z = 29 (for type B gadgets)\n   Equation 3: x + y + z = 6 (total operation time)\n\n3.

Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the solution satisfies all three equations\n   - Ensure all values are non-negative and within the 6-hour limit\n\n5. Interpret the results:\n   - The value of x will be the number of hours machine X should operate\n   - Round the result to the nearest decimal if necessary\n\n6. Double-check the production numbers:\n   - Calculate the total production of A and B gadgets using the solution\n   - Verify that it matches or exceeds the required 19A and 29B\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the number of hours machine X should operate\n\n8.
