    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Closest Point Problem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find which point is closest to (3, -2) among the given options.\n   - The options are: (2, 0), (5, -4), (-1, 2), (0, -3)\n\n2. Recall the distance formula:\n   - The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\n     sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\n3. Calculate distances:\n   - For each given point, calculate its distance from (3, -2) using the distance formula.\n   - Use a calculator for precise calculations.\n\n4. Compare distances:\n   - After calculating all distances, compare them to find the smallest.\n\n5. Identify the closest point:\n   - The point with the smallest distance is the closest to (3, -2).\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State which point is closest to (3, -2) based on the calculations.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward calculations and comparisons.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the distance between (3, -2) and the first point (2, 0), which is approximately 2.236 units, we need to continue with our plan and calculate the distances for the remaining points. Let's move on to the next point, which is (5, -4).\n\nUsing the same distance formula:\nd = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nFor the point (5, -4):\nx1 = 3, y1 = -2 (our reference point)\nx2 = 5, y2 = -4 (the point we're measuring to)\n\nWe need to:\n1. Calculate (x2 - x1)^2, which is (5 - 3)^2\n2. Calculate (y2 - y1)^2, which is (-4 - (-2))^2\n3. Add these results\n4. Take the square root of the sum\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we should use a calculator for this calculation as well.
