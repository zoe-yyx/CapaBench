    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Closest Point Problem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find which point is closest to (3, -2) among the given options.\n   - The options are: (2, 0), (5, -4), (-1, 2), (0, -3)\n\n2. Recall the distance formula:\n   - The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:\n     sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\n3. Calculate distances:\n   - For each given point, calculate its distance from (3, -2) using the distance formula.\n   - Use a calculator for precise calculations.\n\n4. Compare distances:\n   - After calculating all distances, compare them to find the smallest.\n\n5. Identify the closest point:\n   - The point with the smallest distance is the closest to (3, -2).\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State which point is closest to (3, -2) based on the calculations.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward calculations and comparisons.\n",
