    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem type: Subtraction of complex numbers\n\n2. Break down the problem:\n   - First complex number: (4 - 3i)\n   - Second complex number: (2 + 5i)\n   - Operation: Subtraction\n\n3. Recall the rules for complex number subtraction:\n   - Subtract the real parts\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts\n   - Combine the results\n\n4. Plan the calculation steps:\n   a) Subtract the real parts: 4 - 2\n   b) Subtract the imaginary parts: -3i - 5i\n      Note: This is equivalent to -3i + (-5i)\n   c) Combine the results from steps a and b\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms\n   - Express in the standard form a + bi\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure the answer is in the correct form\n   - Verify that both real and imaginary parts are accounted for\n\n7. Present the final answer in the form a + bi\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We have successfully calculated both parts of our complex number subtraction:\n   - Real part: 4 - 2 = 2\n   - Imaginary part: -3 + (-5) = -8\n\n2. Now we need to combine these results into the standard form of a complex number: a + bi\n\n3. Our real part (a) is 2, and our imaginary part (b) is -8.\n\n4. Therefore, our final answer should be in the form: 2 + (-8)i\n\n5. This can be simplified to: 2 - 8i\n\n6. The next logical step is to formulate this final answer and verify that it's correct.\n\n7. We should instruct the acting agent to write out the final answer as \"2 - 8i\" and confirm that this is the correct representation of (4 - 3i) - (2 + 5i).\n\nThis step will complete our problem-solving process, providing the final answer in the standard form of a complex number.\n",
