    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem type: Subtraction of complex numbers\n\n2. Break down the problem:\n   - First complex number: (4 - 3i)\n   - Second complex number: (2 + 5i)\n   - Operation: Subtraction\n\n3. Recall the rules for complex number subtraction:\n   - Subtract the real parts\n   - Subtract the imaginary parts\n   - Combine the results\n\n4. Plan the calculation steps:\n   a) Subtract the real parts: 4 - 2\n   b) Subtract the imaginary parts: -3i - 5i\n      Note: This is equivalent to -3i + (-5i)\n   c) Combine the results from steps a and b\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms\n   - Express in the standard form a + bi\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure the answer is in the correct form\n   - Verify that both real and imaginary parts are accounted for\n\n7. Present the final answer in the form a + bi\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, the historical actions, and the current progress, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have successfully calculated the real part of our result. The calculation 4 - 2 = 2 gives us the real part of our final complex number.\n\n2. Now we need to focus on the imaginary part. As per our planning strategy, we need to subtract the imaginary parts: -3i - 5i.\n\n3. This can be rewritten as -3i + (-5i), which simplifies to combining like terms with i as the variable.\n\n4. The next logical step is to calculate -3 + (-5) to find the coefficient of i in our final answer.\n\n5. After this calculation, we will have both the real and imaginary parts of our result, allowing us to express the final answer in the standard form a + bi.\n\n6. Therefore, we should instruct the acting agent to use the calculator to compute -3 + (-5).\n\nThis calculation will give us the coefficient of i in our final complex number, completing the subtraction process and allowing us to express our answer in the standard form.\n",
