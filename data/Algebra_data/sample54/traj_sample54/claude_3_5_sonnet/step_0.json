    "planning_context": "\n1. Review the concept of complex conjugates:\n   - Recall that the conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi.\n   - The conjugate operation only changes the sign of the imaginary part.\n\n2. Identify the real and imaginary parts of the given complex number:\n   - Real part: 7\n   - Imaginary part: -4i\n\n3. Apply the conjugate operation:\n   - Keep the real part the same\n   - Change the sign of the imaginary part\n\n4. Write the final answer:\n   - Combine the unchanged real part with the sign-changed imaginary part\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure that multiplying the original number by its conjugate results in a real number\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer in just a few steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given complex number $7 - 4i$, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. We have identified that the real part of the complex number is 7 and the imaginary part is -4i.\n\n2. To find the conjugate, we need to keep the real part the same and change the sign of the imaginary part.\n\n3. The real part (7) remains unchanged.\n\n4. The imaginary part (-4i) will have its sign changed to positive.\n\n5. Therefore, the conjugate will be formed by combining the unchanged real part with the sign-changed imaginary part.\n\nThis reasoning leads us to conclude that the conjugate of $7 - 4i$ should be $7 + 4i$. \n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to write down this result and verify it by multiplying the original number by its conjugate to ensure it results in a real number.\n",
