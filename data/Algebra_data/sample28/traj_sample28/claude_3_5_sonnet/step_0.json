Calculate 2x^2:\n   - Square x (5^2)\n   - Multiply the result by 2\n\n4. Calculate 3y^2:\n   - Square y (3^2)\n   - Multiply the result by 3\n\n5. Sum up the results:\n   - Add the results from steps 3 and 4\n\n6. Verify the final answer:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Double-check the original expression and given values\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds of calculation, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we should start by calculating the first term of the expression: 2x^2. We know that x = 5, so we need to:\n\n1. Square x: 5^2 = 25\n2. Multiply the result by 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to use a calculator to compute these values. We'll start with squaring 5 and then multiply the result by 2.\n\nThis calculation will give us the value of the first term in our expression, which is an important step towards solving the entire problem. After this, we'll move on to calculating the second term 3y^2.\n",
