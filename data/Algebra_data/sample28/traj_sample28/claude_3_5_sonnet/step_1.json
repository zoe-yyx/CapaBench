    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given values:\n   - x = 5\n   - y = 3\n\n2. Analyze the expression:\n   - The expression is 2x^2 + 3y^2\n   - It consists of two terms: 2x^2 and 3y^2\n\n3. Calculate 2x^2:\n   - Square x (5^2)\n   - Multiply the result by 2\n\n4. Calculate 3y^2:\n   - Square y (3^2)\n   - Multiply the result by 3\n\n5. Sum up the results:\n   - Add the results from steps 3 and 4\n\n6. Verify the final answer:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Double-check the original expression and given values\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds of calculation, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the progress made so far, we have successfully calculated the first term of the expression (2x^2). The result is 50, which is correct.\n\nNow, we need to focus on the second term of the expression: 3y^2. We know that y = 3. So, our next steps should be:\n\n1. Square y: 3^2\n2. Multiply the result by 3\n\nThis calculation will give us the value of the second term in our expression. Once we have this result, we'll be ready to sum up both terms to get the final answer.\n\nTherefore, our next operation should be to use the calculator to compute 3 * (3^2). This will complete the calculation of the second term and bring us one step closer to the final solution.\n",
