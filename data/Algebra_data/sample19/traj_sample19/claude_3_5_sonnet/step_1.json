    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given operation:\n   - Analyze the definition of $x \\bigstar y = x - y - 3$\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n   - Use the given information that $x \\bigstar 5 = 7$\n   - Substitute the definition into this equation\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify the equation\n   - Isolate the variable x\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the found value of x back into the original equation to check\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that satisfies the given condition\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for basic arithmetic operations, but no complex calculations or external searches should be necessary for this problem.\n",

We've successfully solved for x and found that x = 15.\n\n2. The next crucial step is to verify this solution by plugging it back into the original equation. We need to check if 15 \u2b50 5 indeed equals 7.\n\n3. To do this, we'll use the definition of the \u2b50 operation: x \u2b50 y = x - y - 3\n\n4. Substituting our values:\n   15 \u2b50 5 = 15 - 5 - 3\n\n5. The acting agent should now calculate this expression:\n   First, 15 - 5 = 10\n   Then, 10 - 3 = 7\n\n6. If the result is indeed 7, it confirms our solution is correct.\n\nLet's instruct the acting agent to perform these calculations to verify our solution.\n",
