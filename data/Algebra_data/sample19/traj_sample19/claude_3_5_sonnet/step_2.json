Set up the equation:\n   - Use the given information that $x \\bigstar 5 = 7$\n   - Substitute the definition into this equation\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify the equation\n   - Isolate the variable x\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the found value of x back into the original equation to check\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that satisfies the given condition\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5 steps, well within the 10-round limit.
