    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we have already simplified the square roots. Now, we need to focus on simplifying the fractions and multiplying the numerators and denominators separately. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have simplified \u221a4 to 2 and \u221a9 to 3, so our expression now looks like:\n   $\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{12} \\cdot \\frac{18}{3}$\n\n2. We should simplify the fraction 2/12 to 1/6 to make our calculations easier.\n\n3. After simplifying, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:\n   - Numerator: 8 * 1 * 18\n   - Denominator: \u221a2 * 6 * 3\n\n4. Once we have these multiplications done, we'll be in a position to rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \u221a2.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should focus on simplifying the fraction 2/12 and then multiplying the numerators and denominators separately. This will set us up for the final step of rationalizing the denominator.\n",
