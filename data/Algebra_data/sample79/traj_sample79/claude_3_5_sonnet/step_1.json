Simplify the denominator:\n   - Multiply 6 and 3\n\n7. Rationalize the denominator:\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a2\n\n8. Simplify the final expression\n\n9. Check the result and ensure the denominator is rationalized\n\n10. Present the final simplified and rationalized expression\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, the next logical step in our reasoning process should be:\n\n1. Focus on simplifying the square roots as outlined in step 1 of the plan.\n2. We know that \u221a2 cannot be simplified further, so we'll leave it as is.\n3. We can simplify \u221a4 to 2.\n4. We can simplify \u221a9 to 3.\n\nAfter this simplification, we should rewrite the expression with these simplified square roots. This aligns with step 2 of our planning strategy.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed to perform these simplifications and rewrite the expression accordingly. This will set us up for the subsequent steps in our plan, including simplifying fractions and multiplying numerators and denominators.\n",
