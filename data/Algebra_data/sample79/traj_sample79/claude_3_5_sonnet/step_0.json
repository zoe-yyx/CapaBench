Rewrite the expression with simplified square roots:\n   $\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{12} \\cdot \\frac{18}{3}$\n\n3. Simplify fractions:\n   - Simplify 2/12 to 1/6\n\n4. Multiply numerators and denominators separately:\n   $\\frac{8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 18}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 3}$\n\n5. Calculate the numerator and simplify if possible\n\n6. Simplify the denominator:\n   - Multiply 6 and 3\n\n7. Rationalize the denominator:\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a2\n\n8. Simplify the final expression\n\n9. Check the result and ensure the denominator is rationalized\n\n10. Present the final simplified and rationalized expression\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that no actions have been taken yet, we should start with the first steps of simplifying the square roots and rewriting the expression. Here's the reasoning for the next operation:\n\n1. We need to simplify the square roots in the original expression:\n   - \u221a2 cannot be simplified further\n   - \u221a4 can be simplified to 2\n   - \u221a9 can be simplified to 3\n\n2. After simplifying these square roots, we should rewrite the expression with the simplified forms.\n\nThis simplification will give us a clearer view of the expression and set us up for the subsequent steps in the plan. The acting agent should focus on simplifying these square roots and rewriting the expression accordingly.\n",
