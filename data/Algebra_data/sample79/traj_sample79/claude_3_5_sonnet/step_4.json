Rewrite the expression with simplified square roots:\n   $\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{12} \\cdot \\frac{18}{3}$\n\n3. Simplify fractions:\n   - Simplify 2/12 to 1/6\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on our current progress and the planning strategy, here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have simplified the numerator to 144 and the denominator to \u221a2 * 18. Our expression now looks like:\n\n   $\\frac{144}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 18}$\n\n2. The next critical step is to rationalize the denominator. To do this, we need to:\n   a) Multiply both the numerator and denominator by \u221a2\n   b) This will eliminate the square root in the denominator\n\n3. After rationalizing, our expression will look like:\n\n   $\\frac{144 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 18 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{144 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{18 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{144 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{36}$\n\n4. Once we have this form, we can simplify further by:\n   a) Reducing the fraction 144/36\n   b) Expressing the final answer in the form a\u221a2/b, where a and b are integers\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should focus on multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \u221a2 to rationalize the denominator. This is a crucial step in simplifying and rationalizing our expression.\n",
