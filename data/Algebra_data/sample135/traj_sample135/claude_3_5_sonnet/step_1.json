    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a quadratic equation: 9m^2 - 24m + k = 0\n   - We need to find the value of k for which this equation has exactly one solution\n\n2. Recall the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution:\n   - This occurs when the discriminant is equal to zero\n\n3. Write out the general form of a quadratic equation:\n   - ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   - Identify a, b, and c in our equation\n\n4. Recall the discriminant formula:\n   - b^2 - 4ac\n\n5. Apply the discriminant formula to our equation:\n   - Substitute the values of a, b, and c\n   - Set the discriminant equal to zero\n\n6. Solve the resulting equation for k:\n   - Simplify the equation\n   - Isolate k\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of k back into the original equation\n   - Check if it indeed results in only one solution\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of k that satisfies the condition\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation of (-24)^2 = 576, we can now proceed with setting up and solving the discriminant equation. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have the discriminant equation: b^2 - 4ac = 0\n2. We know that b^2 = 576, a = 9, and c = k\n3. Let's substitute these values into the equation:\n\n   576 - 4(9)(k) = 0\n\n4. Now we need to simplify and solve this equation for k:\n   \n   576 - 36k = 0\n   \n   We can add 36k to both sides:\n   \n   576 = 36k\n   \n   Then divide both sides by 36:\n   \n   576/36 = k\n\n5. The next step is to calculate this division to find the exact value of k.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we use the calculator to divide 576 by 36 to determine the precise value of k.\n",
