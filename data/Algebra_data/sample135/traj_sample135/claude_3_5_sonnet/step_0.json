    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have a quadratic equation: 9m^2 - 24m + k = 0\n   - We need to find the value of k for which this equation has exactly one solution\n\n2. Recall the condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution:\n   - This occurs when the discriminant is equal to zero\n\n3. Write out the general form of a quadratic equation:\n   - ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   - Identify a, b, and c in our equation\n\n4. Recall the discriminant formula:\n   - b^2 - 4ac\n\n5. Apply the discriminant formula to our equation:\n   - Substitute the values of a, b, and c\n   - Set the discriminant equal to zero\n\n6. Solve the resulting equation for k:\n   - Simplify the equation\n   - Isolate k\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of k back into the original equation\n   - Check if it indeed results in only one solution\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of k that satisfies the condition\n",
