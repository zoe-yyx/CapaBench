Analyze the given information:\n   - The polynomial is p(x) = x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 105\n   - The roots are consecutive odd prime numbers\n   - The sum of the roots is less than 30\n   - We need to find the value of b\n\n2. Identify possible consecutive odd prime number triplets:\n   - List odd primes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...\n   - Find triplets with sum less than 30: (3, 5, 7) and (5, 7, 11)\n\n3. Use Vieta's formulas to relate the roots to the coefficients:\n   - Sum of roots = a (since -a is the coefficient of x^2)\n   - Product of roots = -(-105) = 105 (constant term)\n\n4. Determine the value of a:\n   - a = sum of roots (either 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 or 5 + 7 + 11 = 23)\n\n5. Use Vieta's formula for the sum of products of roots taken two at a time:\n   - Sum of products of roots taken two at a time = b\n\n6. Calculate b using the formula: b = r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3\n   Where r1, r2, and r3 are the roots\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the calculated b is an integer\n   - Confirm that p(x) = x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 105 has the identified roots\n\n8. If needed, repeat steps 4-7 with the other possible triplet\n\n9. Present the final value of b\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by identifying the possible triplets of consecutive odd prime numbers that have a sum less than 30. From the strategy, we already know that there are two such triplets: (3, 5, 7) and (5, 7, 11).\n\nLet's begin with the first triplet (3, 5, 7):\n\n1. Sum of roots: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\n   This means a = 15 (from Vieta's formula)\n\n2. Product of roots: 3 * 5 * 7 = 105\n   This confirms our constant term -105 in the polynomial\n\n3. To find b, we need to calculate the sum of products of roots taken two at a time:\n   b = 3*5 + 3*7 + 5*7 = 15 + 21 + 35 = 71\n\nNow, let's verify if this triplet works:\n- a and b are both integers (15 and 71 respectively)\n- The roots (3, 5, 7) are indeed consecutive odd primes\n- Their sum (15) is less than 30\n\nGiven that this triplet satisfies all conditions, we don't need to check the second triplet (5, 7, 11).\n\nTherefore, our reasoning suggests that the value of b is 71. The acting agent should verify this by checking if the polynomial p(x) = x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 indeed has roots 3, 5, and 7.\n",
