    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given polynomials:\n   - h(x) = 2x^4 + 5x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 7\n   - j(x) = -x^4 + 3x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 4\n\n2. Recall the method for subtracting polynomials:\n   - Subtract the coefficients of like terms\n   - Keep the same variable and exponents\n\n3. Align the terms of both polynomials by their degree:\n   - Group x^4 terms\n   - Group x^3 terms\n   - Group x^2 terms\n   - Group x terms\n   - Group constant terms\n\n4. Perform the subtraction h(x) - j(x):\n   - Subtract the coefficients of each group of like terms\n   - Pay attention to the signs, especially for j(x) terms\n\n5. Combine like terms and simplify:\n   - Ensure all terms are in descending order of exponents\n   - Verify that all coefficients are correct\n\n6. Write the final polynomial:\n   - Express the result in the form ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e\n   - Ensure all terms are included, even if some coefficients are zero\n\n7. Double-check the result:\n   - Verify that no terms were missed or miscalculated\n   - Confirm that the degrees of terms are in descending order\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the polynomial with coefficients in descending powers of x\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we need to guide the acting agent to perform the subtraction of h(x) - j(x) term by term. Here's the reasoning to guide the next step:\n\n1. We should start with the highest degree term, which is x^4.\n   - In h(x), the coefficient of x^4 is 2\n   - In j(x), the coefficient of x^4 is -1\n   - We need to subtract: 2 - (-1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n2.

For the x^2 term:\n   - In h(x), the coefficient of x^2 is -4\n   - In j(x), the coefficient of x^2 is 6\n   - We need to subtract: -4 - 6 = -10\n\n4. For the x term:\n   - In h(x), the coefficient of x is 1\n   - In j(x), the coefficient of x is -2\n   - We need to subtract: 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. Finally, for the constant term:\n   - In h(x), the constant term is -7\n   - In j(x), the constant term is 4\n   - We need to subtract: -7 - 4 = -11\n\nAfter performing these subtractions, we should have all the terms of our resulting polynomial. The acting agent should now combine these terms into a single polynomial expression, keeping the terms in descending order of the exponents.\n",
