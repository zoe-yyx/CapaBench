    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given polynomials:\n   - h(x) = 2x^4 + 5x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 7\n   - j(x) = -x^4 + 3x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 4\n\n2. Recall the method for subtracting polynomials:\n   - Subtract the coefficients of like terms\n   - Keep the same variable and exponents\n\n3. Align the terms of both polynomials by their degree:\n   - Group x^4 terms\n   - Group x^3 terms\n   - Group x^2 terms\n   - Group x terms\n   - Group constant terms\n\n4. Perform the subtraction h(x) - j(x):\n   - Subtract the coefficients of each group of like terms\n   - Pay attention to the signs, especially for j(x) terms\n\n5. Combine like terms and simplify:\n   - Ensure all terms are in descending order of exponents\n   - Verify that all coefficients are correct\n\n6. Write the final polynomial:\n   - Express the result in the form ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e\n   - Ensure all terms are included, even if some coefficients are zero\n\n7. Double-check the result:\n   - Verify that no terms were missed or miscalculated\n   - Confirm that the degrees of terms are in descending order\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the polynomial with coefficients in descending powers of x\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given polynomials, we should guide the acting agent to perform the subtraction of j(x) from h(x). Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We need to subtract j(x) from h(x). This means we'll be performing h(x) - j(x).\n\n2. When subtracting polynomials, we subtract the coefficients of like terms while keeping the variables and exponents the same.\n\n3. We should start with the highest degree term (x^4) and work our way down to the constant term.\n\n4. For the x^4 term:\n   - In h(x), we have 2x^4\n   - In j(x), we have -x^4\n   - When we subtract, it becomes 2x^4 - (-x^4) = 2x^4 + x^4 = 3x^4\n\n5. We should continue this process for all terms: x^3, x^2, x, and the constant term.\n\n6. After subtracting each term, we'll combine like terms to get our final polynomial.\n\nThe acting agent should perform these subtractions term by term, and then combine like terms to get the final result. They should pay close attention to the signs, especially when subtracting negative terms from j(x), as this will result in addition.\n",
