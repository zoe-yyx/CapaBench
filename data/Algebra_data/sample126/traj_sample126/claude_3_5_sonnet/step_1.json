    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given polynomials:\n   - h(x) = 2x^4 + 5x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 7\n   - j(x) = -x^4 + 3x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x + 4\n\n2. Recall the method for subtracting polynomials:\n   - Subtract the coefficients of like terms\n   - Keep the same variable and exponents\n\n3. Align the terms of both polynomials by their degree:\n   - Group x^4 terms\n   - Group x^3 terms\n   - Group x^2 terms\n   - Group x terms\n   - Group constant terms\n\n4. Perform the subtraction h(x) - j(x):\n   - Subtract the coefficients of each group of like terms\n   - Pay attention to the signs, especially for j(x) terms\n\n5. Combine like terms and simplify:\n   - Ensure all terms are in descending order of exponents\n   - Verify that all coefficients are correct\n\n6. Write the final polynomial:\n   - Express the result in the form ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e\n   - Ensure all terms are included, even if some coefficients are zero\n\n7. Double-check the result:\n   - Verify that no terms were missed or miscalculated\n   - Confirm that the degrees of terms are in descending order\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the polynomial with coefficients in descending powers of x\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current step of the problem-solving process, we should guide the acting agent to perform the subtraction of h(x) - j(x) term by term. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We need to align the terms of both polynomials by their degree, starting with the highest degree (x^4) and working our way down to the constant terms.\n\n2. For each degree, we will subtract the coefficient of j(x) from the coefficient of h(x).\n\n3. We should pay special attention to the signs, especially when subtracting the terms of j(x), as subtraction of a negative becomes addition.\n\n4. We'll proceed in this order:\n   a) x^4 terms: 2x^4 - (-x^4)\n   b) x^3 terms: 5x^3 - 3x^3\n   c) x^2 terms: -4x^2 - 6x^2\n   d) x terms: x - (-2x)\n   e) Constant terms: -7 - 4\n\n5. After performing these subtractions, we'll combine the results to form our final polynomial.\n\nThis reasoning will guide the acting agent to systematically perform the subtraction operation for each term, ensuring no terms are missed and the signs are handled correctly.\n",
