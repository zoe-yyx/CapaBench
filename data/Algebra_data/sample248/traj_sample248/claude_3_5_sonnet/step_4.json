Recognize this as a system of symmetric equations, which suggests using elementary symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = x + y + z\n   e\u2082 = xy + yz + xz\n   e\u2083 = xyz\n\n3. Relate the given equations to symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = 12\n   e\u2082 = 47\n   e\u2083 = 60\n\n4. Use Vieta's formulas to set up a cubic equation:\n   t\u00b3 - e\u2081t\u00b2 + e\u2082t - e\u2083 = 0\n   t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0\n\n5. Solve the cubic equation to find the roots (x, y, z):\n   a) Use a calculator or computer algebra system to factor the polynomial\n   b) If factoring is difficult, use numerical methods like the cubic formula\n\n6. Verify that the found roots satisfy x < y < z and all original equations\n\n7. Present the answer in the form (x, y, z)\n\n8. Double-check all calculations and reasoning\n\n9. If any step proves difficult, consider alternative approaches or ask for assistance\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and any insights gained\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the results from the calculator, we've made significant progress in verifying our solution. Let's analyze the current state and determine the next steps:\n\n1.

To complete our verification, we should use the calculator to check this final equation:\n   Calculate 3*4*5 to verify if it equals 60\n\n5. If this calculation yields the expected result, we can confidently conclude that (3, 4, 5) is indeed the correct solution to our system of equations.\n\n6. Once all verifications are complete, we can present the final answer in the required format: (x, y, z) = (3, 4, 5).\n\n7. We should also note that the constraint x < y < z is satisfied by 3 < 4 < 5.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step for the acting agent is to use the calculator to perform this final calculation:\n3*4*5\n\nAfter this calculation, we should have all the information needed to confirm our solution and conclude the problem-solving process. If the result is 60, we can confidently state that we have found the correct solution to the problem.\n",
