    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equations:\n   Equation 1: x + y + z = 12\n   Equation 2: xy + xz + yz = 47\n   Equation 3: xyz = 60\n   Constraint: x < y < z\n\n2. Recognize this as a system of symmetric equations, which suggests using elementary symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = x + y + z\n   e\u2082 = xy + yz + xz\n   e\u2083 = xyz\n\n3. Relate the given equations to symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = 12\n   e\u2082 = 47\n   e\u2083 = 60\n\n4. Use Vieta's formulas to set up a cubic equation:\n   t\u00b3 - e\u2081t\u00b2 + e\u2082t - e\u2083 = 0\n   t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0\n\n5. Solve the cubic equation to find the roots (x, y, z):\n   a) Use a calculator or computer algebra system to factor the polynomial\n   b) If factoring is difficult, use numerical methods like the cubic formula\n\n6. Verify that the found roots satisfy x < y < z and all original equations\n\n7. Present the answer in the form (x, y, z)\n\n8. Double-check all calculations and reasoning\n\n9. If any step proves difficult, consider alternative approaches or ask for assistance\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and any insights gained\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the results from the calculator, we now have the roots of the cubic equation: [3, 4, 5]. This is a significant step forward in solving our problem. Let's analyze these results and determine our next steps:\n\n1. The roots [3, 4, 5] already satisfy our constraint x < y < z, which is excellent.\n\n2. We need to verify if these values satisfy all three original equations:\n\n   a) x + y + z = 12\n   b) xy + xz + yz = 47\n   c) xyz = 60\n\n3. To confirm this, we should substitute these values into each equation and verify that they hold true.\n\n4. If all equations are satisfied, we will have our final answer in the form (x, y, z) = (3, 4, 5).\n\nTherefore, our next logical step is to use the calculator to verify these equations:\n\n1. Calculate 3 + 4 + 5 to check if it equals 12\n2. Calculate 3*4 + 3*5 + 4*5 to check if it equals 47\n3. Calculate 3*4*5 to check if it equals 60\n\nOnce these calculations are performed and verified, we can confidently present our final answer. The acting agent should proceed with these calculations using the calculator.\n",
