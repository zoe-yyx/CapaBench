    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equations:\n   Equation 1: x + y + z = 12\n   Equation 2: xy + xz + yz = 47\n   Equation 3: xyz = 60\n   Constraint: x < y < z\n\n2. Recognize this as a system of symmetric equations, which suggests using elementary symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = x + y + z\n   e\u2082 = xy + yz + xz\n   e\u2083 = xyz\n\n3. Relate the given equations to symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = 12\n   e\u2082 = 47\n   e\u2083 = 60\n\n4. Use Vieta's formulas to set up a cubic equation:\n   t\u00b3 - e\u2081t\u00b2 + e\u2082t - e\u2083 = 0\n   t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0\n\n5. Solve the cubic equation to find the roots (x, y, z):\n   a) Use a calculator or computer algebra system to factor the polynomial\n   b) If factoring is difficult, use numerical methods like the cubic formula\n\n6. Verify that the found roots satisfy x < y < z and all original equations\n\n7. Present the answer in the form (x, y, z)\n\n8. Double-check all calculations and reasoning\n\n9. If any step proves difficult, consider alternative approaches or ask for assistance\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and any insights gained\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the result from the calculator, which solved the equation t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0, we now have the roots of this cubic equation. These roots represent the values of x, y, and z that we are looking for.\n\nOur next steps should be:\n\n1. Identify the three roots from the calculator's output.\n2. Verify that these roots satisfy the original equations:\n   - x + y + z = 12\n   - xy + xz + yz = 47\n   - xyz = 60\n3. Check if the roots satisfy the constraint x < y < z.\n4. If all conditions are met, we can present the answer in the form (x, y, z).\n\nTo proceed, we need to:\n\n1. Extract the numerical values of the roots from the calculator's output.\n2. Substitute these values into the original equations to verify they are correct.\n3. Order the roots from smallest to largest to ensure they meet the x < y < z constraint.\n\nThe acting agent should now take these steps:\n\n1. List the numerical values of the three roots found by the calculator.\n2. Use the calculator to verify that these roots satisfy the three original equations.\n3.
