    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equations:\n   Equation 1: x + y + z = 12\n   Equation 2: xy + xz + yz = 47\n   Equation 3: xyz = 60\n   Constraint: x < y < z\n\n2. Recognize this as a system of symmetric equations, which suggests using elementary symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = x + y + z\n   e\u2082 = xy + yz + xz\n   e\u2083 = xyz\n\n3. Relate the given equations to symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = 12\n   e\u2082 = 47\n   e\u2083 = 60\n\n4. Use Vieta's formulas to set up a cubic equation:\n   t\u00b3 - e\u2081t\u00b2 + e\u2082t - e\u2083 = 0\n   t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0\n\n5. Solve the cubic equation to find the roots (x, y, z):\n   a) Use a calculator or computer algebra system to factor the polynomial\n   b) If factoring is difficult, use numerical methods like the cubic formula\n\n6. Verify that the found roots satisfy x < y < z and all original equations\n\n7. Present the answer in the form (x, y, z)\n\n8. Double-check all calculations and reasoning\n\n9. If any step proves difficult, consider alternative approaches or ask for assistance\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and any insights gained\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We should start by focusing on step 4 of the planning strategy, which involves setting up the cubic equation using Vieta's formulas.\n\n2. We already have the equation from the planning strategy:\n   t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0\n\n3. The next logical step would be to solve this cubic equation as mentioned in step 5 of the planning strategy. However, solving a cubic equation by hand can be complex and time-consuming.\n\n4. Given that we have access to a calculator or potentially a computer algebra system, it would be most efficient to use these tools to factor the polynomial or find its roots numerically.\n\n5. Therefore, I recommend that the acting agent use a calculator or computer algebra system to solve the equation t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0 for its roots.\n\n6. Once we have the roots, we can verify if they satisfy the original equations and the constraint x < y < z, as outlined in step 6 of the planning strategy.\n\n7.
