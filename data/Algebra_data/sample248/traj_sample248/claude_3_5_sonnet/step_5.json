Recognize this as a system of symmetric equations, which suggests using elementary symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = x + y + z\n   e\u2082 = xy + yz + xz\n   e\u2083 = xyz\n\n3. Relate the given equations to symmetric polynomials:\n   e\u2081 = 12\n   e\u2082 = 47\n   e\u2083 = 60\n\n4. Use Vieta's formulas to set up a cubic equation:\n   t\u00b3 - e\u2081t\u00b2 + e\u2082t - e\u2083 = 0\n   t\u00b3 - 12t\u00b2 + 47t - 60 = 0\n\n5. Solve the cubic equation to find the roots (x, y, z):\n   a) Use a calculator or computer algebra system to factor the polynomial\n   b) If factoring is difficult, use numerical methods like the cubic formula\n\n6. Verify that the found roots satisfy x < y < z and all original equations\n\n7. Present the answer in the form (x, y, z)\n\n8. Double-check all calculations and reasoning\n\n9.
