    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with an absolute value equation.\n   - The equation is in the form |ax + b| = c, where a = 2, b = 3, and c = 11.\n\n2. Set up two separate equations:\n   - Since the absolute value can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases.\n   - Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 11\n   - Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11\n\n3. Solve Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n\n4. Solve Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -14\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -7\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - We have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -7\n   - The question asks for the bigger value of x\n\n6. Identify the final answer:\n   - The bigger value between 4 and -7 is 4\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The bigger value of x that satisfies |2x + 3| = 11 is 4\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and historical actions, we have successfully solved both equations:\n\n1. From Equation 1 (2x + 3 = 11), we found x = 4\n2. From Equation 2 (2x + 3 = -11), we found x = -7\n\nNow, we need to address the original question, which asks for the bigger value of x that satisfies the equation |2x + 3| = 11.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -7\n2. The question specifically asks for the bigger value of x\n3. To determine the bigger value, we need to compare these two numbers\n\nIt's clear that 4 is greater than -7, but to be thorough, we should guide the acting agent to perform a comparison operation.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator or a simple comparison function to confirm that 4 is indeed greater than -7.\n\nAfter this confirmation, we can conclude that the bigger value of x that satisfies the equation |2x + 3| = 11 is 4.\n\nAs a final step, we should verify this solution by substituting x = 4 back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies |2x + 3| = 11.\n",
