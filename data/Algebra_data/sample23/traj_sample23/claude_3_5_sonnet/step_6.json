    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with an absolute value equation.\n   - The equation is in the form |ax + b| = c, where a = 2, b = 3, and c = 11.\n\n2. Set up two separate equations:\n   - Since the absolute value can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases.\n   - Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 11\n   - Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11\n\n3. Solve Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n\n4. Solve Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -14\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -7\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - We have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -7\n   - The question asks for the bigger value of x\n\n6. Identify the final answer:\n   - The bigger value between 4 and -7 is 4\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The bigger value of x that satisfies |2x + 3| = 11 is 4\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the current progress, we have successfully solved both equations, identified the bigger value of x, and verified our solution. Here's the reasoning for the final step:\n\n1. We solved both equations:\n   - Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 11, which gave us x = 4\n   - Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11, which gave us x = -7\n\n2. We identified that 4 is the bigger value between 4 and -7.\n\n3. We've just verified the solution by substituting x = 4 back into the original equation:\n   |2x + 3| = 11\n   |2(4) + 3| = 11\n   |11| = 11\n\n4. The verification shows that our solution is correct, as 11 = 11 is true.\n\n5. We have completed all steps in the planning strategy and have a verified answer.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the bigger value of x that satisfies |2x + 3| = 11 is indeed 4. The acting agent should now present this as the final answer to the original problem.\n",
