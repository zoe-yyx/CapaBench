    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with an absolute value equation.\n   - The equation is in the form |ax + b| = c, where a = 2, b = 3, and c = 11.\n\n2. Set up two separate equations:\n   - Since the absolute value can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases.\n   - Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 11\n   - Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11\n\n3. Solve Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n\n4. Solve Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -14\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -7\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - We have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -7\n   - The question asks for the bigger value of x\n\n6. Identify the final answer:\n   - The bigger value between 4 and -7 is 4\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The bigger value of x that satisfies |2x + 3| = 11 is 4\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and historical actions, we have successfully solved Equation 1 and started solving Equation 2. Let's continue with the solution for Equation 2:\n\n1. We've subtracted 3 from both sides of 2x + 3 = -11, resulting in 2x = -14.\n\n2. The next step is to solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.\n\n3. This operation will give us the second potential solution for x.\n\n4. After obtaining this solution, we'll be able to compare it with the solution from Equation 1 (x = 4) to determine the bigger value of x.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform the division: -14 \u00f7 2\n\nOnce we have this result, we'll have both solutions and can proceed to compare them to answer the original question.\n",
