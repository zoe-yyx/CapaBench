    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with an absolute value equation.\n   - The equation is in the form |ax + b| = c, where a = 2, b = 3, and c = 11.\n\n2. Set up two separate equations:\n   - Since the absolute value can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases.\n   - Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 11\n   - Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11\n\n3. Solve Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n\n4. Solve Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -14\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -7\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - We have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -7\n   - The question asks for the bigger value of x\n\n6. Identify the final answer:\n   - The bigger value between 4 and -7 is 4\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The bigger value of x that satisfies |2x + 3| = 11 is 4\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the current progress, we have successfully solved both equations and found two potential solutions: x = 4 and x = -7. Now, we need to verify the solution and present the final answer. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have already identified that 4 is the bigger value between 4 and -7, which aligns with the question asking for the bigger value of x.\n\n2. To ensure our solution is correct, we should verify it by substituting x = 4 back into the original equation |2x + 3| = 11.\n\n3. The verification process involves:\n   a) Calculating 2x + 3 with x = 4\n   b) Taking the absolute value of the result\n   c) Checking if it equals 11\n\n4. If the verification is successful, we can confidently present 4 as the final answer.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this verification:\n\nFirst, calculate 2(4) + 3:\n- Use the calculator to compute 2 * 4\n- Then add 3 to the result\n\nAfter that, we'll take the absolute value of this result and compare it to 11 to complete the verification.\n",
