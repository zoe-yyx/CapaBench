    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with an absolute value equation.\n   - The equation is in the form |ax + b| = c, where a = 2, b = 3, and c = 11.\n\n2. Set up two separate equations:\n   - Since the absolute value can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases.\n   - Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 11\n   - Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11\n\n3. Solve Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n\n4. Solve Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -14\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -7\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - We have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -7\n   - The question asks for the bigger value of x\n\n6. Identify the final answer:\n   - The bigger value between 4 and -7 is 4\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The bigger value of x that satisfies |2x + 3| = 11 is 4\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have subtracted 3 from both sides of Equation 1 (2x + 3 = 11), we have simplified it to 2x = 8. The next step is to solve for x by dividing both sides by 2.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We've successfully isolated the term with x on one side of the equation.\n2. To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of x, which is 2.\n3. This operation will give us the solution for x in Equation 1.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform the division: 8 \u00f7 2\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have the first potential solution for x. Then, we'll need to move on to solving Equation 2 (2x + 3 = -11) using the same process.\n",
