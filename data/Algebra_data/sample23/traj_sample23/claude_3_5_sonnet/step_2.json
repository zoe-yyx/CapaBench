    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - Recognize that we're dealing with an absolute value equation.\n   - The equation is in the form |ax + b| = c, where a = 2, b = 3, and c = 11.\n\n2. Set up two separate equations:\n   - Since the absolute value can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases.\n   - Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 11\n   - Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11\n\n3. Solve Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n\n4. Solve Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -14\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -7\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - We have two solutions: x = 4 and x = -7\n   - The question asks for the bigger value of x\n\n6. Identify the final answer:\n   - The bigger value between 4 and -7 is 4\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The bigger value of x that satisfies |2x + 3| = 11 is 4\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have solved Equation 1 (2x + 3 = 11) and found that x = 4, we need to move on to solving Equation 2 (2x + 3 = -11). Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We start with Equation 2: 2x + 3 = -11\n\n2. Similar to how we solved Equation 1, we need to isolate the term with x:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation\n   - This will give us: 2x = -14\n\n3. After subtracting, we'll need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 2\n\n4. Once we have the solution for Equation 2, we can compare it with the solution from Equation 1 (x = 4) to find the bigger value of x.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to begin solving Equation 2 by subtracting 3 from both sides of 2x + 3 = -11. They should use a calculator to perform this calculation: -11 - 3\n",
