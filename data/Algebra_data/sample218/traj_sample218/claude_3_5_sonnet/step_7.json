    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - We have the function f(x) = 2x + 3\n   - We know that g(f(x)) = 3x - 4 for all x\n   - We need to find g(7)\n\n2. Identify the key relationship:\n   - The composition g(f(x)) is given, which connects f(x) and g(x)\n\n3. Find the inverse of f(x):\n   - Solve for x in terms of f(x)\n   - This will help us express x in terms of the input to g\n\n4. Use the inverse of f(x) in the composition equation:\n   - Replace x in g(f(x)) = 3x - 4 with the expression found in step 3\n\n5. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   - This will give us the general form of g(y)\n\n6. Calculate g(7):\n   - Use the general form of g(y) found in step 5\n   - Substitute y with 7\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the original equations\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of g(7)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, as it focuses on the essential steps to derive g(x) and then calculate g(7).\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and our problem-solving journey, let's provide clear reasoning for the final, correct answer:\n\n1. We correctly derived the general form of g(y) = 1.5y - 8.5, which can also be expressed as g(y) = (3/2)y - 17/2 in fractional form.\n\n2. To find g(7), we substitute y = 7 into this equation:\n   g(7) = (3/2)(7) - 17/2\n        = 21/2 - 17/2\n        = 4/2\n\n3. Simplifying this fraction to its lowest terms:\n   4/2 = 2\n\n4. Verification:\n   - We know f(x) = 2x + 3\n   - For f(x) to equal 7, we solve: 2x + 3 = 7\n     2x = 4\n     x = 2\n   - Now, we check if g(f(2)) = 3(2) - 4:\n     g(f(2)) = g(7) = 2\n     3(2) - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\n\n5. This verification confirms that our answer satisfies the original condition: g(f(x)) = 3x - 4 for all x.\n\nTherefore, the final, correct answer is: 2\n\nThe acting agent should confirm this answer without restating \"g(7) =\" or using any other expression. Simply confirming the number 2 as the final answer is sufficient and correct.\n",
