Identify the key relationship:\n   - The composition g(f(x)) is given, which connects f(x) and g(x)\n\n3. Find the inverse of f(x):\n   - Solve for x in terms of f(x)\n   - This will help us express x in terms of the input to g\n\n4. Use the inverse of f(x) in the composition equation:\n   - Replace x in g(f(x)) = 3x - 4 with the expression found in step 3\n\n5. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   - This will give us the general form of g(y)\n\n6. Calculate g(7):\n   - Use the general form of g(y) found in step 5\n   - Substitute y with 7\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the original equations\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of g(7)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, as it focuses on the essential steps to derive g(x) and then calculate g(7).\n",

    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on why the acting agent confirmed a wrong answer:\n\n```\nFlaw: The acting agent failed to recognize that the answer should be expressed as a fraction rather than a decimal.\n\nImprovement: The reasoning and acting agents should be more careful about retaining exact forms like fractions when not explicitly told to use decimals, and should express the final answer as 1/2 instead of 2.\n```\n\nThe key issue here is that while the numerical value of 2 is correct, the standard form for this answer should be the fraction 1/2. Mathematical problems often expect answers in their most simplified exact form, which means keeping fractions as fractions rather than converting to decimals.\n\nTo improve in future:\n\n1. The reasoning agent should explicitly state that answers should be left in fraction form unless decimal approximations are specifically requested. \n\n2. The acting agent should be programmed to express final answers as simplified fractions by default, only using decimals when instructed.\n\n3. A verification step could be added to check if the final answer contains any decimals that could be expressed as fractions.\n\n4. The planning agent could include a reminder about preferred answer formats in the initial problem breakdown.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, the agents will be better equipped to provide mathematically precise answers in the expected format for future problems.",
