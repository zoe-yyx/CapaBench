Identify the key relationship:\n   - The composition g(f(x)) is given, which connects f(x) and g(x)\n\n3. Find the inverse of f(x):\n   - Solve for x in terms of f(x)\n   - This will help us express x in terms of the input to g\n\n4. Use the inverse of f(x) in the composition equation:\n   - Replace x in g(f(x)) = 3x - 4 with the expression found in step 3\n\n5. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   - This will give us the general form of g(y)\n\n6. Calculate g(7):\n   - Use the general form of g(y) found in step 5\n   - Substitute y with 7\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the original equations\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of g(7)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, as it focuses on the essential steps to derive g(x) and then calculate g(7).\n",
