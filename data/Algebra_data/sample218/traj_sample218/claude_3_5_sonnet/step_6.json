Identify the key relationship:\n   - The composition g(f(x)) is given, which connects f(x) and g(x)\n\n3. Find the inverse of f(x):\n   - Solve for x in terms of f(x)\n   - This will help us express x in terms of the input to g\n\n4. Use the inverse of f(x) in the composition equation:\n   - Replace x in g(f(x)) = 3x - 4 with the expression found in step 3\n\n5. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   - This will give us the general form of g(y)\n\n6. Calculate g(7):\n   - Use the general form of g(y) found in step 5\n   - Substitute y with 7\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the original equations\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of g(7)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, as it focuses on the essential steps to derive g(x) and then calculate g(7).\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the reflection. You're absolutely correct, and I apologize for the oversight in my previous reasoning. Let's provide the correct reasoning and guide the acting agent to the correct final answer:\n\n1. We correctly derived that g(y) = 1.5y - 8.5, which can be expressed as g(y) = (3/2)y - 17/2 in fraction form.\n\n2.

We must simplify this fraction to its lowest terms:\n   4/2 = 2/1 = 2\n\nTherefore, the correct value of g(7) is indeed 2, which matches our original decimal calculation.\n\nThis reasoning process demonstrates the importance of simplifying fractions to their lowest terms and double-checking our work, especially in the final steps of problem-solving.\n\nThe acting agent should now confirm the correct final answer: g(7) = 2.\n\nThis correction maintains mathematical precision and provides the answer in its simplest form, which is a whole number in this case, not a fraction.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The acting agent repeatedly confirmed incorrect answers without properly simplifying fractions or considering the requirement to express the answer in its simplest form.\n\nImprovement: The acting agent should always simplify fractions to their lowest terms and express the final answer in its simplest form, whether it's a whole number, fraction, or decimal, based on the problem's requirements.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals a series of missteps in the problem-solving process:\n\n1. Initially, the correct answer of 2 was calculated but not properly validated.\n\n2. There was an incorrect attempt to express the answer as a fraction (1/2) without proper simplification.\n\n3. Finally, although the correct numerical value (2) was reached, it was still marked as incorrect.\n\nTo improve future problem-solving:\n\n1. Always simplify fractions to their lowest terms before finalizing an answer.\n\n2. Double-check calculations at each step, especially when converting between decimal and fractional forms.\n\n3. Be mindful of the problem's requirements regarding the form of the answer (decimal, fraction, or simplest form).\n\n4. Implement a final verification step to ensure the answer satisfies all conditions of the original problem.\n\n5. When expressing final answers, avoid repeating variable names or equals signs unless specifically required. In this case, simply stating \"2\" as the final answer would likely have been correct.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, the acting agent can avoid similar errors in future problem-solving tasks and provide more accurate and precise answers.",
