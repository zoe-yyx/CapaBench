    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |x + 4| = 8\n   - This means the absolute value of (x + 4) equals 8\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value:\n   - |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b (where b is non-negative)\n\n3. Set up two separate equations:\n   - x + 4 = 8\n   - x + 4 = -8\n\n4. Solve each equation:\n   - For x + 4 = 8, subtract 4 from both sides\n   - For x + 4 = -8, subtract 4 from both sides\n\n5. Obtain the two solutions:\n   - From x + 4 = 8, we get x = 4\n   - From x + 4 = -8, we get x = -12\n\n6. Identify the larger solution:\n   - Compare 4 and -12\n\n7. Return the larger solution as the final answer\n\n8. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we've started solving the first equation: x + 4 = 8. The next logical step is to solve this equation for x.\n\nTo do this, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Since we have x + 4 = 8, we should subtract 4 from both sides of the equation. This operation will cancel out the 4 on the left side and give us the value of x.\n\nAfter solving this equation, we'll have one of our two potential solutions. Remember, we'll need to solve the second equation (x + 4 = -8) as well to get the other potential solution. Then, we can compare these two solutions to determine which one is larger, as required by the problem.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the subtraction operation to solve for x in the equation x + 4 = 8.\n",
