    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |x + 4| = 8\n   - This means the absolute value of (x + 4) equals 8\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value:\n   - |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b (where b is non-negative)\n\n3. Set up two separate equations:\n   - x + 4 = 8\n   - x + 4 = -8\n\n4. Solve each equation:\n   - For x + 4 = 8, subtract 4 from both sides\n   - For x + 4 = -8, subtract 4 from both sides\n\n5. Obtain the two solutions:\n   - From x + 4 = 8, we get x = 4\n   - From x + 4 = -8, we get x = -12\n\n6. Identify the larger solution:\n   - Compare 4 and -12\n\n7. Return the larger solution as the final answer\n\n8. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation\n",
