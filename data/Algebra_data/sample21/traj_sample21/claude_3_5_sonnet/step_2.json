    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |x + 4| = 8\n   - This means the absolute value of (x + 4) equals 8\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value:\n   - |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b (where b is non-negative)\n\n3. Set up two separate equations:\n   - x + 4 = 8\n   - x + 4 = -8\n\n4. Solve each equation:\n   - For x + 4 = 8, subtract 4 from both sides\n   - For x + 4 = -8, subtract 4 from both sides\n\n5. Obtain the two solutions:\n   - From x + 4 = 8, we get x = 4\n   - From x + 4 = -8, we get x = -12\n\n6. Identify the larger solution:\n   - Compare 4 and -12\n\n7. Return the larger solution as the final answer\n\n8. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we've successfully solved the first equation x + 4 = 8 and found that x = 4. This is one of our potential solutions.\n\nNow, we need to move on to solving the second equation from our initial setup: x + 4 = -8. This equation represents the other possibility when we consider the absolute value property |x + 4| = 8.\n\nTo solve x + 4 = -8, we need to isolate x by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation. This operation will give us our second potential solution.\n\nAfter we solve this equation, we'll have both solutions, and we can then compare them to determine which one is larger, as required by the original problem.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to solve the equation x + 4 = -8 by subtracting 4 from both sides.\n",
