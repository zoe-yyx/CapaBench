    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |x + 4| = 8\n   - This means the absolute value of (x + 4) equals 8\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value:\n   - |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b (where b is non-negative)\n\n3. Set up two separate equations:\n   - x + 4 = 8\n   - x + 4 = -8\n\n4. Solve each equation:\n   - For x + 4 = 8, subtract 4 from both sides\n   - For x + 4 = -8, subtract 4 from both sides\n\n5. Obtain the two solutions:\n   - From x + 4 = 8, we get x = 4\n   - From x + 4 = -8, we get x = -12\n\n6. Identify the larger solution:\n   - Compare 4 and -12\n\n7. Return the larger solution as the final answer\n\n8. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we haven't taken any actions yet, let's start with the first step of solving the equation. We need to set up two separate equations based on the properties of absolute value.\n\nThe equation |x + 4| = 8 can be rewritten as two linear equations:\n\n1. x + 4 = 8  (positive case)\n2. x + 4 = -8 (negative case)\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to solve these two equations separately. Let's start with the first equation:\n\nx + 4 = 8\n\nThe next logical step would be to subtract 4 from both sides of this equation to isolate x. This will give us one of the solutions to the original equation.\n\nAfter solving this, we'll need to solve the second equation (x + 4 = -8) in a similar manner.\n",
