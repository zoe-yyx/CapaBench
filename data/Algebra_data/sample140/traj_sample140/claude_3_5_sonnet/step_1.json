    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the expression:\n   - Identify the numerator: x + 5\n   - Identify the denominator: x^2 - 5x + 6\n\n2. Determine when the expression is undefined:\n   - The expression is undefined when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring to find the roots\n   - These roots will be the values of x that make the expression undefined\n\n4. Consider when the expression is zero:\n   - The expression is zero when the numerator is zero and the denominator is not zero\n   - Set up the equation: x + 5 = 0\n\n5. Compare the results:\n   - List all the values of x that make the expression undefined or zero\n\n6. Find the smallest positive integer:\n   - From the list of values, identify the smallest positive integer that is not in the list\n   - This will be the smallest positive integer x for which the expression is defined and non-zero\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Substitute the found value back into the original expression to confirm it's defined and non-zero\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the conditions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe previous action was to factor the quadratic expression x^2 - 5x + 6. This is a crucial step in determining when the expression is undefined. Now, we should:\n\n1. Complete the factoring of x^2 - 5x + 6. This will give us the roots of the quadratic equation, which are the values that make the denominator zero.\n\n2. Once we have the factors, we can identify the exact values of x that make the denominator zero. These are the values for which the expression is undefined.\n\n3. We also need to consider when the numerator is zero. The numerator is x + 5, so we should solve the equation x + 5 = 0.\n\n4. After finding these critical values, we can determine the smallest positive integer x that is not among these values, which will be our answer.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to complete the factoring of x^2 - 5x + 6 and find its roots. This will give us crucial information about when the expression is undefined.\n",
