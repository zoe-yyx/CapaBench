Determine when the expression is undefined:\n   - The expression is undefined when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring to find the roots\n   - These roots will be the values of x that make the expression undefined\n\n4. Consider when the expression is zero:\n   - The expression is zero when the numerator is zero and the denominator is not zero\n   - Set up the equation: x + 5 = 0\n\n5. Compare the results:\n   - List all the values of x that make the expression undefined or zero\n\n6. Find the smallest positive integer:\n   - From the list of values, identify the smallest positive integer that is not in the list\n   - This will be the smallest positive integer x for which the expression is defined and non-zero\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Substitute the found value back into the original expression to confirm it's defined and non-zero\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\nTo determine the smallest positive integer value of x that makes the expression defined and non-zero, we need to focus on the denominator of the fraction first. The expression will be undefined when the denominator equals zero. Let's analyze the denominator:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We need to solve it to find the values of x that make the denominator zero. These values will be the points where the expression is undefined.\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use either the quadratic formula or factoring method. Since the coefficients are simple integers, factoring might be easier.\n\nThe next step should be to factor the quadratic expression x^2 - 5x + 6 and solve for x. This will give us the values of x that we need to avoid.\n\nAfter solving the quadratic equation, we should also consider when the numerator (x + 5) equals zero, as this would make the entire expression zero (assuming the denominator is not zero at that point).\n\nBy identifying these critical values, we can then determine the smallest positive integer x that avoids making the expression undefined or zero.\n",
