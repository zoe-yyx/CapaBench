    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the expression:\n   - Identify the numerator: x + 5\n   - Identify the denominator: x^2 - 5x + 6\n\n2. Determine when the expression is undefined:\n   - The expression is undefined when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring to find the roots\n   - These roots will be the values of x that make the expression undefined\n\n4. Consider when the expression is zero:\n   - The expression is zero when the numerator is zero and the denominator is not zero\n   - Set up the equation: x + 5 = 0\n\n5. Compare the results:\n   - List all the values of x that make the expression undefined or zero\n\n6. Find the smallest positive integer:\n   - From the list of values, identify the smallest positive integer that is not in the list\n   - This will be the smallest positive integer x for which the expression is defined and non-zero\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Substitute the found value back into the original expression to confirm it's defined and non-zero\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the conditions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the result of our calculation, we have made significant progress. Let's analyze our findings:\n\n1. We factored the denominator: x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n2. We identified that the expression is undefined when x = 2 or x = 3\n3. We calculated the expression for x = 1: (1+5)/(1^2-5*1+6) = 3\n\nOur calculation shows that when x = 1, the expression is defined and non-zero (it equals 3). This is a crucial piece of information.\n\nGiven that:\n- The expression is undefined for x = 2 and x = 3\n- We're looking for the smallest positive integer x\n- The expression is defined and non-zero for x = 1\n\nWe can conclude that 1 is indeed the smallest positive integer value of x for which the expression is defined and non-zero.\n\nTo solidify our conclusion, we should verify that this result satisfies all conditions of the original problem:\n1. It's a positive integer\n2. The expression is defined (not dividing by zero)\n3. The expression is non-zero\n\nWe've already confirmed all these points through our calculation.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning leads us to believe that 1 is the final answer to this problem. No further calculations or steps are necessary.\n",
