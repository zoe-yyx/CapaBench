    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the expression:\n   - Identify the numerator: x + 5\n   - Identify the denominator: x^2 - 5x + 6\n\n2. Determine when the expression is undefined:\n   - The expression is undefined when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring to find the roots\n   - These roots will be the values of x that make the expression undefined\n\n4. Consider when the expression is zero:\n   - The expression is zero when the numerator is zero and the denominator is not zero\n   - Set up the equation: x + 5 = 0\n\n5. Compare the results:\n   - List all the values of x that make the expression undefined or zero\n\n6. Find the smallest positive integer:\n   - From the list of values, identify the smallest positive integer that is not in the list\n   - This will be the smallest positive integer x for which the expression is defined and non-zero\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Substitute the found value back into the original expression to confirm it's defined and non-zero\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the conditions\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our planning strategy, we have already factored the denominator x^2 - 5x + 6. The next logical step in our reasoning process is to use this factored form to determine when the expression is undefined.\n\nLet's consider the factored form of the denominator:\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nThe expression will be undefined when the denominator equals zero, which occurs when x = 2 or x = 3.\n\nNow, we should also consider when the numerator could be zero:\nx + 5 = 0\nx = -5\n\nHowever, we're looking for the smallest positive integer, so x = -5 is not relevant to our final answer.\n\nGiven this information, we know that the expression is undefined for x = 2 and x = 3. Therefore, the smallest positive integer x for which the expression is defined and non-zero must be 1 or 4.\n\nTo determine which it is, we should evaluate the expression for x = 1 to see if it's defined and non-zero. If it is, then 1 is our answer. If not, then 4 will be our answer.\n\nThe next step should be to evaluate the expression for x = 1.\n",
