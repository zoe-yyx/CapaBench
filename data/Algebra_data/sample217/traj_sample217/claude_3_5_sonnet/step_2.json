Calculate g(g(10)):\n   - Use the result from step 2 as the input for g(x)\n   - Determine which part of the function applies for this new input\n   - Compute the final value of g(g(10))\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the reflection. You're absolutely correct that we should present the final answer in its exact fractional form rather than as a decimal approximation. Let's revisit our calculations and express the result correctly:\n\n1. We correctly calculated g(10) = -1/8\n\n2. For g(-1/8), we used g(x) = 4x - 5\n   g(-1/8) = 4(-1/8) - 5\n           = -1/2 - 5\n           = -5 - 1/2\n           = -11/2\n\nTherefore, the exact value of g(g(10)) is -11/2.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Confirm this fraction is correct by converting it to a decimal: -11/2 = -5.5\n2. Present the final answer as the fraction -11/2\n3. If required, provide an explanation that this is the exact form of the answer, equivalent to the decimal -5.5\n\nThis approach maintains mathematical precision and aligns with best practices in mathematical problem-solving.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on the problem-solving process:\n\n```\nFlaw: The acting agent provided the correct numerical value but included the function notation \"g(g(10)) =\" in the final answer, which was likely interpreted as an incorrect response by the evaluation system.\n\nImprovement: The acting agent should present only the numerical value as the final answer, without including any additional notation or variables, to align with the expected answer format.\n```\n\nThis reflection highlights that while the mathematical reasoning and calculation were correct, the presentation of the answer included unnecessary elements that may have caused it to be marked as incorrect. For future problems, the acting agent should focus on providing only the specific value requested, without restating the problem or including function notation in the final answer. This approach will help ensure that correct calculations are not misinterpreted due to formatting issues.",
