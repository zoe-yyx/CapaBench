    "observation": "Consider a piecewise function $g(x)$ defined as follows:\n\n$$\ng(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n4x - 5 & \\text{if } x < 2, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2-x} & \\text{if } x \\geq 2.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n What is the value of $g(g(10))$?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the piecewise function:\n   - Identify the two parts of the function g(x)\n   - Note the conditions for each part (x < 2 and x \u2265 2)\n\n2. Calculate g(10):\n   - Determine which part of the function applies when x = 10\n   - Compute the value of g(10) using the appropriate formula\n\n3. Calculate g(g(10)):\n   - Use the result from step 2 as the input for g(x)\n   - Determine which part of the function applies for this new input\n   - Compute the final value of g(g(10))\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the correct part of the function was used in each step\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - Clearly state the value of g(g(10))\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for precise calculations when needed.

    "reasoning": "\nThank you for the reflection. You're absolutely right about the importance of presenting the final answer in plain text format without any special formatting or notation. Let's apply this lesson to our current problem-solving process and provide clear guidance for the acting agent.\n\nBased on our previous calculations, which were correct, we have:\n\n1. g(10) = -1/8\n2. g(-1/8) = 4(-1/8) - 5 = -11/2\n\nTherefore, g(g(10)) = -11/2\n\nNow, to ensure we present this answer correctly, we should instruct the acting agent to:\n\n1. Present only the numerical value -11/2 as the final answer.\n2. Use plain text format, avoiding any LaTeX formatting, function notation, or explanatory text.\n3. Double-check that no extra characters, spaces, or formatting are included in the answer.\n\nThe acting agent should simply state the fraction -11/2 as the final answer in plain text. To verify this one last time, the acting agent could use a calculator to confirm that -11/2 is indeed equal to -5.5, which matches our earlier decimal calculation.\n\nAfter this verification, the acting agent should submit the final answer as:\n\n-11/2\n\nThis approach will maintain mathematical precision while adhering to the expected answer format without any special formatting or notation.\n",
