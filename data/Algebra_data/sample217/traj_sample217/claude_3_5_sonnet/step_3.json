Calculate g(g(10)):\n   - Use the result from step 2 as the input for g(x)\n   - Determine which part of the function applies for this new input\n   - Compute the final value of g(g(10))\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and our previous calculations, we need to focus on presenting the final answer in the most precise and concise form. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We correctly calculated g(10) = -1/8\n2. We then correctly calculated g(-1/8) = 4(-1/8) - 5 = -11/2\n\nOur reasoning and calculations are correct, but we need to ensure the acting agent presents the answer in the most appropriate format. Given that the original question asked \"What is the value of g(g(10))?\", we should instruct the acting agent to:\n\n1. Present only the final numerical value: -11/2\n2. Avoid including any function notation or variables in the answer\n3. Provide this fraction as the exact answer, without converting to a decimal\n\nThe acting agent should simply state the final answer as the fraction -11/2, without any additional context or notation. This approach will maintain mathematical precision while adhering to the expected answer format.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the historical thoughts and actions, I can provide the following reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The acting agent included unnecessary function notation and LaTeX formatting in the final answer, which led to an incorrect response despite the correct numerical value.\n\nImprovement: The acting agent should present only the raw numerical value as the final answer, without any additional notation, formatting, or explanatory text.\n```\n\nThe reasoning and calculations throughout the problem-solving process were correct. The team successfully identified that g(g(10)) = -11/2, which is the correct answer. However, the error occurred in the presentation of the final answer.\n\nIn the last action, the acting agent included LaTeX formatting (\\\\frac{11}{2}) in the answer. This is likely why the answer was marked as incorrect, even though the numerical value was correct.\n\nFor future problems, it's crucial to remember that when asked for a value, the response should be just the value itself, without any additional formatting or notation. In this case, the correct way to present the answer would have been simply: -11/2\n\nThis reflection emphasizes the importance of not only calculating the correct answer but also presenting it in the exact format requested by the problem. It's a reminder that in mathematical problem-solving, the precision of the answer's presentation can be just as important as the calculation itself.",
