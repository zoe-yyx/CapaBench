Calculate g(g(10)):\n   - Use the result from step 2 as the input for g(x)\n   - Determine which part of the function applies for this new input\n   - Compute the final value of g(g(10))\n\n4.

    "reflection": "Based on the historical thoughts and actions, I can provide the following reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The acting agent consistently included LaTeX formatting in the final answer, which is not the correct format for submission.\nImprovement: The acting agent should present the final answer as a plain text fraction \"-11/2\" without any LaTeX formatting, function notation, or additional explanations.\n```\n\nThe reasoning and calculations throughout the problem-solving process were correct. The team successfully derived the correct value of g(g(10)) as -11/2. However, the error occurred in the presentation of the final answer.\n\nDespite multiple reflections emphasizing the need to present the answer in its simplest form without additional notation, the acting agent continued to use LaTeX formatting (\\\\frac{11}{2}) in the final submission. This formatting, while mathematically correct, is not the expected format for the answer.\n\nFor future problems, it's crucial to emphasize that the final answer should be presented exactly as it would be typed in plain text, without any special formatting or notations. In this case, the correct submission should have been simply \"-11/2\".\n\nTo improve in the next round:\n1. The acting agent should be explicitly instructed to avoid using any special characters or formatting in the final answer.\n2. A final verification step should be added where the agent double-checks that the answer is in plain text format.\n3. If possible, implement a rule or check that automatically removes any LaTeX or other formatting from the final answer before submission.\n\nBy focusing on these improvements, the team can ensure that correct calculations are not undermined by formatting issues in future problem-solving attempts.",
