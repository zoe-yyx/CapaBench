    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the expression:\n   - Recognize that we have a fraction with square roots in both numerator and denominator.\n   - The goal is to simplify this and express the result with an integer denominator.\n\n2. Simplify under the square root in the numerator:\n   - Factor 45 into its prime factors.\n   - Identify perfect square factors if any.\n\n3. Simplify the fraction:\n   - Use the property of square roots: $\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$\n   - Apply this to our expression.\n\n4. Further simplify the result:\n   - If possible, separate the square root into a product of an integer and a square root.\n\n5. Rationalize the denominator:\n   - If there's still a square root in the denominator, multiply both numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{5}$.\n\n6. Perform final calculations:\n   - Multiply or divide as necessary to get the final simplified form.\n\n7. Check the result:\n   - Ensure the denominator is an integer.\n   - Verify that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct simplified expression within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations and properties of square roots.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our current progress, we have successfully simplified the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}}$ to 3 and verified its correctness. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We factored 45 into its prime factors: 45 = 3 * 3 * 5\n2. We simplified $\\sqrt{45}$ to $3\\sqrt{5}$\n3. Our expression became $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n4. We canceled out $\\sqrt{5}$ in the numerator and denominator, resulting in 3\n5. We verified our result by:\n   a. Calculating $(\\frac{\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}})^2 = \\frac{45}{5} = 9$\n   b. Calculating $3^2 = 9$\n\nSince both calculations resulted in 9, we have confirmed that our simplification is correct.\n\nAt this point, we have successfully simplified the expression and expressed it with an integer denominator (which is 1, as our final result is just 3). No further calculations or simplifications are needed.\n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to formulate a clear and concise final answer, stating that $\\frac{\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}} = 3$.\n",
