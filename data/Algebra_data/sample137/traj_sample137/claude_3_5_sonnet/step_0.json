    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the expression:\n   - Recognize that we have a fraction with square roots in both numerator and denominator.\n   - The goal is to simplify this and express the result with an integer denominator.\n\n2. Simplify under the square root in the numerator:\n   - Factor 45 into its prime factors.\n   - Identify perfect square factors if any.\n\n3. Simplify the fraction:\n   - Use the property of square roots: $\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$\n   - Apply this to our expression.\n\n4. Further simplify the result:\n   - If possible, separate the square root into a product of an integer and a square root.\n\n5. Rationalize the denominator:\n   - If there's still a square root in the denominator, multiply both numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{5}$.\n\n6. Perform final calculations:\n   - Multiply or divide as necessary to get the final simplified form.\n\n7. Check the result:\n   - Ensure the denominator is an integer.\n   - Verify that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct simplified expression within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations and properties of square roots.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we're at the beginning of the problem-solving process, we should start by simplifying the expression under the square root in the numerator. This aligns with step 2 of our plan.\n\nLet's focus on simplifying $\\sqrt{45}$:\n\n1. We need to factor 45 into its prime factors.\n2. Once factored, we should identify if there are any perfect square factors within 45.\n\nThis step is crucial because it will allow us to potentially simplify the square root in the numerator, making the subsequent steps easier.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator or mental math to factor 45 and identify its prime factors. This will set us up for the next steps in our simplification process.\n",
