    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the expression:\n   - Recognize that we have a fraction with square roots in both numerator and denominator.\n   - The goal is to simplify this and express the result with an integer denominator.\n\n2. Simplify under the square root in the numerator:\n   - Factor 45 into its prime factors.\n   - Identify perfect square factors if any.\n\n3. Simplify the fraction:\n   - Use the property of square roots: $\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$\n   - Apply this to our expression.\n\n4. Further simplify the result:\n   - If possible, separate the square root into a product of an integer and a square root.\n\n5. Rationalize the denominator:\n   - If there's still a square root in the denominator, multiply both numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{5}$.\n\n6. Perform final calculations:\n   - Multiply or divide as necessary to get the final simplified form.\n\n7. Check the result:\n   - Ensure the denominator is an integer.\n   - Verify that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct simplified expression within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations and properties of square roots.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we've made a good start by factoring 45 into its prime factors: 45 = 3 * 3 * 5. Now, let's proceed with the next steps in our simplification process:\n\n1. We can rewrite the numerator as $\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{3 * 3 * 5} = \\sqrt{9 * 5} = \\sqrt{9} * \\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5}$\n\n2. Our expression now looks like this: $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n\n3. We can simplify this further by canceling out the $\\sqrt{5}$ in the numerator and denominator:\n\n   $\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = 3$\n\n4. We've now simplified the expression to a single integer, which means we've achieved our goal of expressing the answer with an integer denominator.\n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to verify this result by squaring both sides of the original equation to check if they are equal.\n",
