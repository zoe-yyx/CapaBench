    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Hexagon Area Problem:\n\n1. Recognize the problem:\n   - We have a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle\n   - The circle's center is at the origin (0,0) with radius 10\n   - We are given the coordinates of all six vertices\n\n2. Recall relevant formulas:\n   - Area of a regular hexagon: A = (3\u221a3 * s^2) / 2, where s is the side length\n   - Alternatively, area can be calculated as 6 equilateral triangles\n\n3. Determine the side length:\n   - Use the distance formula between two adjacent points\n   - sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\n\n4. Calculate the area:\n   - Apply the area formula for a regular hexagon\n   - Or calculate the area of one equilateral triangle and multiply by 6\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Cross-check with an alternative method (e.g., using triangles if we used the direct formula, or vice versa)\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable given the circle's radius\n\n6. Optional advanced verification:\n   - Calculate the area of the circle (\u03c0r^2)\n   - Confirm that the hexagon area is less than the circle area\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the calculated area with appropriate units (square units)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on efficient calculation and verification steps.\n",
