    "observation": "A school has three types of classrooms: small, medium, and large. There are a total of 62 classrooms. The ratio of small to medium classrooms is 3:2, and the ratio of medium to large classrooms is 5:3. If all types of classrooms are fully utilized and each small classroom holds 20 students, each medium classroom holds 30 students, and each large classroom holds 50 students, how many students can the school accommodate?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given ratios:\n   - Small to medium classrooms: 3:2\n   - Medium to large classrooms: 5:3\n   \n2. Set up variables:\n   Let x = number of medium classrooms\n   Then, 3x/2 = number of small classrooms\n   And 3x/5 = number of large classrooms\n\n3. Create an equation using the total number of classrooms:\n   3x/2 + x + 3x/5 = 62\n\n4. Solve the equation to find x (number of medium classrooms)\n\n5. Calculate the number of small and large classrooms using the ratios\n\n6. Verify that the sum of all classrooms equals 62\n\n7. Calculate the number of students in each type of classroom:\n   - Small: 20 students each\n   - Medium: 30 students each\n   - Large: 50 students each\n\n8. Sum up the total number of students from all classrooms\n\n9. Double-check the calculations\n\n10. Present the final answer: total number of students the school can accommodate\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result, we now know that x = 20, which represents the number of medium classrooms. This is a crucial piece of information that allows us to move forward with our problem-solving process.\n\nLet's continue with the next steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of small classrooms:\n   Small classrooms = 3x/2 = 3(20)/2 = 30\n\n2. Calculate the number of large classrooms:\n   Large classrooms = 3x/5 = 3(20)/5 = 12\n\n3. Verify that the sum of all classrooms equals 62:\n   Small (30) + Medium (20) + Large (12) = 62\n\nNow that we have the distribution of classrooms, we can proceed to calculate the number of students each type of classroom can accommodate:\n\n4. Calculate the number of students in small classrooms:\n   30 small classrooms * 20 students each\n\n5. Calculate the number of students in medium classrooms:\n   20 medium classrooms * 30 students each\n\n6. Calculate the number of students in large classrooms:\n   12 large classrooms * 50 students each\n\n7. Sum up the total number of students from all classrooms\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations to determine the total number of students the school can accommodate.\n",
