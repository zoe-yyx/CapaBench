    "observation": "A school has three types of classrooms: small, medium, and large. There are a total of 62 classrooms. The ratio of small to medium classrooms is 3:2, and the ratio of medium to large classrooms is 5:3. If all types of classrooms are fully utilized and each small classroom holds 20 students, each medium classroom holds 30 students, and each large classroom holds 50 students, how many students can the school accommodate?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given ratios:\n   - Small to medium classrooms: 3:2\n   - Medium to large classrooms: 5:3\n   \n2. Set up variables:\n   Let x = number of medium classrooms\n   Then, 3x/2 = number of small classrooms\n   And 3x/5 = number of large classrooms\n\n3. Create an equation using the total number of classrooms:\n   3x/2 + x + 3x/5 = 62\n\n4. Solve the equation to find x (number of medium classrooms)\n\n5. Calculate the number of small and large classrooms using the ratios\n\n6. Verify that the sum of all classrooms equals 62\n\n7. Calculate the number of students in each type of classroom:\n   - Small: 20 students each\n   - Medium: 30 students each\n   - Large: 50 students each\n\n8. Sum up the total number of students from all classrooms\n\n9. Double-check the calculations\n\n10. Present the final answer: total number of students the school can accommodate\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on steps 2-4 of the planning strategy. We'll start by setting up the equation using the variables and ratios given.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Set up the equation as described in step 3 of the planning strategy:\n   3x/2 + x + 3x/5 = 62\n\n2. Solve this equation for x, which represents the number of medium classrooms.\n\n3. Once we have the value of x, we can calculate the number of small classrooms (3x/2) and large classrooms (3x/5).\n\nThis will give us the distribution of classrooms, which is crucial for the subsequent steps in calculating the total number of students the school can accommodate.\n\nLet's proceed with setting up and solving this equation.\n",
