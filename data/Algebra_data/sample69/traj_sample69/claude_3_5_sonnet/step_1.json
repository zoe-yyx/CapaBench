Understand the definition:\n   - Analyze the given operation $\\oplus$ and its definition.\n   - Note that $a \\oplus b = a^2 + b^2$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$.\n\n2. Break down the expression:\n   - Identify that we need to calculate $(2 \\oplus 3) \\oplus 4$.\n   - Recognize that this involves two separate applications of the $\\oplus$ operation.\n\n3. Calculate the inner operation:\n   - Compute $2 \\oplus 3$ first.\n   - Apply the definition: $2 \\oplus 3 = 2^2 + 3^2$.\n   - Use a calculator to perform this calculation.\n\n4. Use the result for the outer operation:\n   - Let the result of step 3 be $x$.\n   - The problem now becomes $x \\oplus 4$.\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Apply the definition again: $x \\oplus 4 = x^2 + 4^2$.\n   - Use a calculator to compute this final expression.\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check all calculations.\n   - Ensure that the order of operations was followed correctly.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Provide the numerical result of $(2 \\oplus 3) \\oplus 4$.\n",
