    "observation": "A school sells tickets for a play at $5 for adults and $3 for students. If they sold 120 tickets in total and collected $450, how many adult tickets were sold?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Adult tickets cost $5\n   - Student tickets cost $3\n   - Total tickets sold: 120\n   - Total money collected: $450\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x = number of adult tickets sold\n   - Let y = number of student tickets sold\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 120 (total number of tickets)\n   - Equation 2: 5x + 3y = 450 (total money collected)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Use substitution method:\n      - From Equation 1: y = 120 - x\n   b. Substitute y in Equation 2:\n      - 5x + 3(120 - x) = 450\n   c. Simplify and solve for x:\n      - 5x + 360 - 3x = 450\n      - 2x = 90\n      - x = 45\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate y: y = 120 - 45 = 75\n   - Check if 5(45) + 3(75) = 450\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - 45 adult tickets were sold\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebra and arithmetic operations that can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the current state of our problem-solving process, we have successfully determined that:\n\nx = 45\n\nThis means we have found our answer: 45 adult tickets were sold.\n\nNow, to ensure the completeness and accuracy of our solution, we should verify it by:\n\n1. Calculating the number of student tickets (y):\n   y = 120 - x = 120 - 45 = 75\n\n2. Checking if both original equations are satisfied:\n   a. Total tickets: x + y = 45 + 75 = 120\n   b. Total money: 5x + 3y = 5(45) + 3(75) = 225 + 225 = 450\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these verification calculations:\n\n1. Calculate 120 - 45 to confirm the number of student tickets\n2. Calculate 45 + 75 to verify the total number of tickets\n3. Calculate 5 * 45 and 3 * 75, then add the results to verify the total money collected\n\nIf all these calculations check out, we can confidently conclude that our solution is correct and complete. This verification step is crucial to ensure the accuracy of our problem-solving process and to provide a robust answer to the original question.\n",
