    "observation": "A school sells tickets for a play at $5 for adults and $3 for students. If they sold 120 tickets in total and collected $450, how many adult tickets were sold?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Adult tickets cost $5\n   - Student tickets cost $3\n   - Total tickets sold: 120\n   - Total money collected: $450\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x = number of adult tickets sold\n   - Let y = number of student tickets sold\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 120 (total number of tickets)\n   - Equation 2: 5x + 3y = 450 (total money collected)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Use substitution method:\n      - From Equation 1: y = 120 - x\n   b. Substitute y in Equation 2:\n      - 5x + 3(120 - x) = 450\n   c. Simplify and solve for x:\n      - 5x + 360 - 3x = 450\n      - 2x = 90\n      - x = 45\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate y: y = 120 - 45 = 75\n   - Check if 5(45) + 3(75) = 450\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - 45 adult tickets were sold\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebra and arithmetic operations that can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy provided, we should start by setting up our equations using the given information. The first step is to identify our variables and create two equations that represent the problem.\n\nLet's define:\nx = number of adult tickets sold\ny = number of student tickets sold\n\nNow, we can create two equations:\n\n1. Total number of tickets: x + y = 120\n2. Total money collected: 5x + 3y = 450\n\nThese equations represent our system that we need to solve. The next logical step would be to use the substitution method as suggested in the plan. We can express y in terms of x using the first equation:\n\ny = 120 - x\n\nThis expression for y can then be substituted into the second equation to create a single equation with one variable (x). This will allow us to solve for the number of adult tickets sold.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with this substitution and simplification step next.\n",
