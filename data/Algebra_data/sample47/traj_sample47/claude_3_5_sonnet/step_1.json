    "observation": "A school sells tickets for a play at $5 for adults and $3 for students. If they sold 120 tickets in total and collected $450, how many adult tickets were sold?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Adult tickets cost $5\n   - Student tickets cost $3\n   - Total tickets sold: 120\n   - Total money collected: $450\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x = number of adult tickets sold\n   - Let y = number of student tickets sold\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 120 (total number of tickets)\n   - Equation 2: 5x + 3y = 450 (total money collected)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Use substitution method:\n      - From Equation 1: y = 120 - x\n   b. Substitute y in Equation 2:\n      - 5x + 3(120 - x) = 450\n   c. Simplify and solve for x:\n      - 5x + 360 - 3x = 450\n      - 2x = 90\n      - x = 45\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate y: y = 120 - 45 = 75\n   - Check if 5(45) + 3(75) = 450\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - 45 adult tickets were sold\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebra and arithmetic operations that can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous action, we have successfully set up the equation:\n\n5x + 3(120 - x) = 450\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation for x to find the number of adult tickets sold. Let's guide the acting agent through the algebraic steps:\n\n1. First, we need to distribute the 3 in the equation:\n   5x + 360 - 3x = 450\n\n2. Then, we can combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n   2x + 360 = 450\n\n3. Now, we can subtract 360 from both sides to isolate the term with x:\n   2x = 90\n\n4. Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n   x = 45\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations step by step. Once we have the value of x, we can confirm that this is indeed the number of adult tickets sold.\n\nAfter finding x, we should also calculate y (the number of student tickets) to verify our solution:\ny = 120 - x = 120 - 45 = 75\n\nTo complete the verification, the acting agent should check if these values satisfy both original equations:\n1. x + y = 45 + 75 = 120 (total tickets)\n2. 5x + 3y = 5(45) + 3(75) = 225 + 225 = 450 (total money)\n\nIf both equations are satisfied, we have our final answer: 45 adult tickets were sold.\n",
