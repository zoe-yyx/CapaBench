    "observation": "A school sells tickets for a play at $5 for adults and $3 for students. If they sold 120 tickets in total and collected $450, how many adult tickets were sold?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Adult tickets cost $5\n   - Student tickets cost $3\n   - Total tickets sold: 120\n   - Total money collected: $450\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x = number of adult tickets sold\n   - Let y = number of student tickets sold\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 120 (total number of tickets)\n   - Equation 2: 5x + 3y = 450 (total money collected)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Use substitution method:\n      - From Equation 1: y = 120 - x\n   b. Substitute y in Equation 2:\n      - 5x + 3(120 - x) = 450\n   c. Simplify and solve for x:\n      - 5x + 360 - 3x = 450\n      - 2x = 90\n      - x = 45\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate y: y = 120 - 45 = 75\n   - Check if 5(45) + 3(75) = 450\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - 45 adult tickets were sold\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebra and arithmetic operations that can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous actions and the current state of our problem-solving process, we have successfully simplified our equation to:\n\n2x + 360 = 450\n\nNow, we need to continue solving this equation to find the value of x, which represents the number of adult tickets sold. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do this, we should subtract 360 from both sides:\n   2x + 360 - 360 = 450 - 360\n   2x = 90\n\n2. Now that we have isolated 2x, we need to divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n   2x \u00f7 2 = 90 \u00f7 2\n   x = 45\n\nThis final step will give us the value of x, which is the number of adult tickets sold.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations:\n1. Calculate 450 - 360 to get 90\n2. Calculate 90 \u00f7 2 to get 45\n\nAfter confirming these calculations, we will have our answer: 45 adult tickets were sold.\n\nTo verify this solution, we should also calculate the number of student tickets (y) and check if both original equations are satisfied:\n\n1. Calculate y = 120 - x = 120 - 45 = 75\n2. Verify equation 1: x + y = 45 + 75 = 120\n3. Verify equation 2: 5x + 3y = 5(45) + 3(75) = 225 + 225 = 450\n\nThe acting agent should perform these verification calculations as well.\n",
