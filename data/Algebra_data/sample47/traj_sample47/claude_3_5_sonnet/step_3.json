    "observation": "A school sells tickets for a play at $5 for adults and $3 for students. If they sold 120 tickets in total and collected $450, how many adult tickets were sold?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Adult tickets cost $5\n   - Student tickets cost $3\n   - Total tickets sold: 120\n   - Total money collected: $450\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x = number of adult tickets sold\n   - Let y = number of student tickets sold\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 120 (total number of tickets)\n   - Equation 2: 5x + 3y = 450 (total money collected)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a. Use substitution method:\n      - From Equation 1: y = 120 - x\n   b. Substitute y in Equation 2:\n      - 5x + 3(120 - x) = 450\n   c. Simplify and solve for x:\n      - 5x + 360 - 3x = 450\n      - 2x = 90\n      - x = 45\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate y: y = 120 - 45 = 75\n   - Check if 5(45) + 3(75) = 450\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - 45 adult tickets were sold\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebra and arithmetic operations that can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the current state of our problem-solving process, we have successfully determined that:\n\n2x = 90\n\nNow, we need to complete the final step to solve for x, which represents the number of adult tickets sold. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We need to divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:\n   2x \u00f7 2 = 90 \u00f7 2\n   x = 45\n\nThis final calculation will give us our answer to the original question.\n\nAfter obtaining this result, we should verify our solution by:\n\n1. Calculating the number of student tickets (y):\n   y = 120 - x = 120 - 45 = 75\n\n2. Checking if both original equations are satisfied:\n   a. Total tickets: x + y = 45 + 75 = 120\n   b. Total money: 5x + 3y = 5(45) + 3(75) = 225 + 225 = 450\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations:\n1. Calculate 90 \u00f7 2 to get the value of x (adult tickets)\n2. Calculate 120 - 45 to get the value of y (student tickets)\n3. Verify the equations as described above\n\nIf all calculations check out, we can confidently state that 45 adult tickets were sold, which is the answer to our original problem.\n",
