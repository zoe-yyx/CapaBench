    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Equation |2x+3| = 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |2x+3| = 9\n   - We need to find all values of x that satisfy this equation\n   - Remember that the sum of these values is our final goal\n\n2. Break down the absolute value equation:\n   - Recall that |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b\n   - Apply this to our equation: 2x+3 = 9 or 2x+3 = -9\n\n3. Solve the two resulting linear equations:\n   - Equation 1: 2x+3 = 9\n   - Equation 2: 2x+3 = -9\n\n4. For Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 6\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 3\n\n5. For Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -12\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -6\n\n6. Verify the solutions:\n   - Check if x = 3 and x = -6 satisfy the original equation\n\n7. Sum the solutions:\n   - Add the two x values: 3 + (-6)\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we haven't taken any actions yet, our first step should be to break down the absolute value equation. We need to consider both cases: when the expression inside the absolute value is positive and when it's negative.\n\nLet's start with the first case:\n\n2x + 3 = 9\n\nThis linear equation should be solved first. We should guide the acting agent to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides\n2. Divide both sides by 2\n\nAfter solving this, we'll have our first solution for x. Then, we'll need to consider the second case:\n\n2x + 3 = -9\n\nWe'll solve this equation in the same manner.\n\nBy solving these two equations, we'll find all values of x that satisfy the original equation. The acting agent should be guided to perform these calculations step by step.\n",
