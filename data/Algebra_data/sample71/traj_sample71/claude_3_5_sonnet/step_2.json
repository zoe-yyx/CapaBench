    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Equation |2x+3| = 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |2x+3| = 9\n   - We need to find all values of x that satisfy this equation\n   - Remember that the sum of these values is our final goal\n\n2. Break down the absolute value equation:\n   - Recall that |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b\n   - Apply this to our equation: 2x+3 = 9 or 2x+3 = -9\n\n3. Solve the two resulting linear equations:\n   - Equation 1: 2x+3 = 9\n   - Equation 2: 2x+3 = -9\n\n4. For Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 6\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 3\n\n5. For Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -12\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -6\n\n6. Verify the solutions:\n   - Check if x = 3 and x = -6 satisfy the original equation\n\n7. Sum the solutions:\n   - Add the two x values: 3 + (-6)\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress so far, we have successfully solved the first equation derived from the absolute value equation. We found that when 2x + 3 = 9, x = 3. This is one of the solutions we need.\n\nNow, we need to focus on solving the second equation that comes from the absolute value equation: 2x + 3 = -9. \n\nTo solve this equation, we should follow the same steps as before:\n\n1. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.\n2. Then, divide both sides by 2.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations:\n\n1. We need to calculate -9 - 3 to isolate 2x on one side of the equation.\n2. After that, we'll need to divide the result by 2 to find the value of x.\n\nOnce we have this second solution, we'll have both values of x that satisfy the original absolute value equation. Then, we can proceed to sum these values to get our final answer.\n\nRemember, our goal is to find the sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation |2x+3| = 9. We're halfway there with one solution (x = 3), and we're about to find the second solution.\n",
