    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Equation |2x+3| = 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |2x+3| = 9\n   - We need to find all values of x that satisfy this equation\n   - Remember that the sum of these values is our final goal\n\n2. Break down the absolute value equation:\n   - Recall that |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b\n   - Apply this to our equation: 2x+3 = 9 or 2x+3 = -9\n\n3. Solve the two resulting linear equations:\n   - Equation 1: 2x+3 = 9\n   - Equation 2: 2x+3 = -9\n\n4. For Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 6\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 3\n\n5. For Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -12\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -6\n\n6. Verify the solutions:\n   - Check if x = 3 and x = -6 satisfy the original equation\n\n7. Sum the solutions:\n   - Add the two x values: 3 + (-6)\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the results we've obtained, we have successfully solved the problem. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We broke down the absolute value equation |2x+3| = 9 into two linear equations:\n   2x + 3 = 9 and 2x + 3 = -9\n\n2. We solved both equations:\n   - From 2x + 3 = 9, we found x = 3\n   - From 2x + 3 = -9, we found x = -6\n\n3. We verified that these are indeed the two solutions that satisfy the original equation.\n\n4. As per the original problem statement, we needed to find the sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation.\n\n5. We calculated this sum: 3 + (-6) = -3\n\nTherefore, our final answer is -3. This completes the solution to the problem.\n\nTo ensure completeness, we should guide the acting agent to state the final answer clearly and verify that it satisfies the original equation for both values of x (3 and -6).\n",
