    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Equation |2x+3| = 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |2x+3| = 9\n   - We need to find all values of x that satisfy this equation\n   - Remember that the sum of these values is our final goal\n\n2. Break down the absolute value equation:\n   - Recall that |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b\n   - Apply this to our equation: 2x+3 = 9 or 2x+3 = -9\n\n3. Solve the two resulting linear equations:\n   - Equation 1: 2x+3 = 9\n   - Equation 2: 2x+3 = -9\n\n4. For Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 6\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 3\n\n5. For Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -12\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -6\n\n6. Verify the solutions:\n   - Check if x = 3 and x = -6 satisfy the original equation\n\n7. Sum the solutions:\n   - Add the two x values: 3 + (-6)\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated 9 - 3 = 6, we have successfully completed the first step in solving the equation 2x + 3 = 9. The next logical step is to divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x.\n\nWe now have:\n2x = 6\n\nTo solve for x, we need to divide both sides by 2. This will give us our first solution for x.\n\nAfter this calculation, we should move on to solving the second equation: 2x + 3 = -9. We'll follow a similar process for this equation.\n\nBy solving both equations, we'll find all values of x that satisfy the original absolute value equation. Once we have both solutions, we can sum them to get our final answer.\n",
