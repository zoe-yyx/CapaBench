    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Equation |2x+3| = 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value equation: |2x+3| = 9\n   - We need to find all values of x that satisfy this equation\n   - Remember that the sum of these values is our final goal\n\n2. Break down the absolute value equation:\n   - Recall that |a| = b means either a = b or a = -b\n   - Apply this to our equation: 2x+3 = 9 or 2x+3 = -9\n\n3. Solve the two resulting linear equations:\n   - Equation 1: 2x+3 = 9\n   - Equation 2: 2x+3 = -9\n\n4. For Equation 1:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 6\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 3\n\n5. For Equation 2:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -12\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = -6\n\n6. Verify the solutions:\n   - Check if x = 3 and x = -6 satisfy the original equation\n\n7. Sum the solutions:\n   - Add the two x values: 3 + (-6)\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress, we have successfully solved both equations derived from the original absolute value equation |2x+3| = 9. Let's summarize our findings:\n\n1. From the equation 2x + 3 = 9, we found x = 3\n2. From the equation 2x + 3 = -9, we found x = -6\n\nNow that we have both solutions, we can proceed to the final step of our problem: finding the sum of these solutions. This sum will give us our final answer.\n\nTo complete the problem, we need to add the two values of x that we found:\n\n3 + (-6)\n\nThis calculation will give us the sum of all values of x that satisfy the original equation |2x+3| = 9. \n\nAfter performing this addition, we will have our final answer, which completes the solution to the original problem.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this final calculation.\n",
