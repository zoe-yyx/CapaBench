    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this inequality, we need to focus on the critical points of the equation. The planning strategy identifies these as x = 3 and x = -7, which are the roots of the equation (x-3)(x+7) = 0.\n\nOur next step should be to verify these critical points. We can do this by factoring the equation and solving for x when each factor equals zero:\n\n1. (x - 3) = 0 \u2192 x = 3\n2. (x + 7) = 0 \u2192 x = -7\n\nConfirming these critical points is crucial because they divide the number line into regions where the sign of the inequality may change. \n\nAfter verifying the critical points, we should proceed to create a number line and analyze the sign changes in each region. This will help us determine where the inequality (x-3)(x+7) < 0 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the acting agent use a calculator to verify these critical points and then proceed to create a number line marking these points.\n",
