    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have created a number line with the critical points -7 and 3, and divided it into three regions, we need to analyze the signs of the factors (x-3) and (x+7) in each region. This will help us determine where the inequality (x-3)(x+7) < 0 is satisfied.\n\nLet's reason through each region:\n\n1. For x < -7:\n   (x-3) is negative because x is less than -7, which is less than 3\n   (x+7) is negative because x is less than -7\n\n2. For -7 < x < 3:\n   (x-3) is negative because x is less than 3\n   (x+7) is positive because x is greater than -7\n\n3. For x > 3:\n   (x-3) is positive because x is greater than 3\n   (x+7) is positive because x is greater than -7\n\nRemember, for the product to be negative, one factor must be positive and the other negative. Based on this analysis, we can see that the inequality is satisfied in the region -7 < x < 3.\n\nThe next step should be to identify the smallest integer within this interval that satisfies the inequality. Since we're looking for integers, and the interval is -7 < x < 3, the smallest integer in this range would be -6.\n\nTo verify this, we should substitute x = -6 into the original inequality to confirm it satisfies the condition.\n",
