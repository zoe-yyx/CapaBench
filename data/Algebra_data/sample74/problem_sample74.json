    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To solve the inequality $|3x + 1| < 5$, we consider two cases: Case 1: $3x + 1 < 5$ and Case 2: $3x + 1 > -5$. Simplifying Case 1: $3x < 4$ or $x < \\frac{4}{3}$. Simplifying Case 2: $3x > -6$ or $x > -2$. Combining these two inequalities, we have $-2 < x < \\frac{4}{3}$. Therefore, the range of x that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{(-2, \\frac{4}{3})}$.",
