    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality: |3x + 1| < 5\n   - We need to find the range of x that satisfies this inequality\n   - The result should be expressed in interval notation\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |expression| < k, it can be split into: -k < expression < k\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Split the inequality into: -5 < 3x + 1 < 5\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   a) Solve -5 < 3x + 1:\n      - Subtract 1 from both sides\n      - Divide both sides by 3\n   b) Solve 3x + 1 < 5:\n      - Subtract 1 from both sides\n      - Divide both sides by 3\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Express the solution as an intersection of the two inequalities\n\n6. Express the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are clear and correct\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical action and the planning strategy, we have already solved the inequality and obtained the solution -2 < x < 4/3. The next logical step is to express this solution in interval notation as requested in the original problem.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We have a compound inequality: -2 < x < 4/3\n2. In interval notation, this represents all numbers x that are greater than -2 and less than 4/3\n3. The parentheses () are used to indicate open intervals (not including the endpoints)\n4. The interval notation for this solution would be (-2, 4/3)\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should write the final answer in interval notation as (-2, 4/3). \n\nAfter this, we should proceed to step 7 in our planning strategy, which is to verify the solution by checking if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality |3x + 1| < 5.\n",
