    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality: |3x + 1| < 5\n   - We need to find the range of x that satisfies this inequality\n   - The result should be expressed in interval notation\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |expression| < k, it can be split into: -k < expression < k\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Split the inequality into: -5 < 3x + 1 < 5\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   a) Solve -5 < 3x + 1:\n      - Subtract 1 from both sides\n      - Divide both sides by 3\n   b) Solve 3x + 1 < 5:\n      - Subtract 1 from both sides\n      - Divide both sides by 3\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Express the solution as an intersection of the two inequalities\n\n6. Express the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are clear and correct\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the inequality |3x + 1| < 5, we should start by applying the absolute value inequality property. This property states that for |expression| < k, we can rewrite it as -k < expression < k.\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n\n-5 < 3x + 1 < 5\n\nNow we have a compound inequality that we can solve step by step. Let's focus on solving each part of this compound inequality separately.\n\nFor the left side (-5 < 3x + 1):\n1. Add 5 to both sides: 0 < 3x + 6\n2. Subtract 6 from both sides: -6 < 3x\n3. Divide both sides by 3: -2 < x\n\nFor the right side (3x + 1 < 5):\n1. Subtract 1 from both sides: 3x < 4\n2. Divide both sides by 3: x < 4/3\n\nCombining these results, we get:\n\n-2 < x < 4/3\n\nThis is the solution to our inequality. The next step would be to express this in interval notation.\n",
