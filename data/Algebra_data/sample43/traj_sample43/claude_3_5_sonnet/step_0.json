    "observation": "A toy factory produces an increasing number of toys each day according to an arithmetic sequence. On the first day, the factory produces 10 toys, and on the third day, it produces 18 toys. How many toys will the factory produce on the tenth day?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - The toy production follows an arithmetic sequence\n   - Day 1: 10 toys\n   - Day 3: 18 toys\n   - We need to find the number of toys on Day 10\n\n2. Calculate the common difference of the arithmetic sequence:\n   - Use the information from Day 1 and Day 3 to find the daily increase\n\n3. Determine the formula for the arithmetic sequence:\n   - Use the general form: an = a1 + (n - 1)d\n   Where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the position, and d is the common difference\n\n4. Apply the formula to find the 10th day's production:\n   - Substitute n = 10 into the formula\n\n5. Perform the final calculation to get the answer\n\n6. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\n7. Present the final answer: The number of toys produced on the 10th day\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the arithmetic sequence formula. Let's start by finding the common difference of the sequence:\n\n1. We know that on Day 1, 10 toys were produced, and on Day 3, 18 toys were produced.\n2. The difference between Day 3 and Day 1 is 2 days.\n3. The difference in toy production is 18 - 10 = 8 toys.\n4. So, the common difference (d) per day is 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 toys.\n\nNow that we have the common difference, we can use the arithmetic sequence formula:\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nWhere:\na1 = 10 (first day's production)\nd = 4 (common difference)\nn = 10 (we want to find the 10th day)\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\na10 = 10 + (10 - 1) * 4\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to perform this calculation. After that, we'll have the number of toys produced on the 10th day.\n",
