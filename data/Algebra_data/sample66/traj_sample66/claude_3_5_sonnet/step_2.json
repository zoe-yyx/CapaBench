Analyze the given function:\n   - Understand the piecewise nature of f(x)\n   - Identify the two parts of the function and their conditions\n\n2. Determine which part of the function applies to x = 6:\n   - Check if 6 is less than or equal to 5, or greater than 5\n\n3. Apply the correct function for x = 6:\n   - Since 6 > 5, use f(x) = 2x + 3\n\n4. Calculate f(6):\n   - Substitute x = 6 into the equation f(x) = 2x + 3\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the calculation is correct\n   - Double-check that we used the right part of the function\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State f(6) = [calculated value]\n\nThis plan should lead to a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, as the problem is relatively simple once the correct part of the function is identified.\n",
