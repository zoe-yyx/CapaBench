    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation:\n   - Identify that we're dealing with an absolute value equation: |3x - 2| = 4\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value equations:\n   - An equation of the form |A| = B (where B is positive) is equivalent to two equations:\n     A = B or A = -B\n\n3. Apply this property to our equation:\n   - Set up two equations:\n     3x - 2 = 4   or   3x - 2 = -4\n\n4. Solve each equation separately:\n   - For 3x - 2 = 4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n   - For 3x - 2 = -4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - Identify which solution yields the smaller value of x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the smaller x value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies |3x - 2| = 4\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations that can be easily performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress so far, we have successfully solved the first equation derived from |3x - 2| = 4, which is 3x - 2 = 4. We've found that x = 2 for this case.\n\nNow, we need to solve the second equation: 3x - 2 = -4\n\nFollowing the same process as before, we should:\n\n1. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n   3x - 2 + 2 = -4 + 2\n   3x = -2\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n   3x / 3 = -2 / 3\n   x = -2/3\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division: -2 \u00f7 3\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have both potential values for x:\n1. x = 2 (from the first equation)\n2. x = -2/3 (from the second equation, once calculated)\n\nOnce we have both values, we can compare them to determine which is smaller. This will give us the final answer to our original question: the smallest value of x that satisfies |3x - 2| = 4.\n\nFor the next action, the acting agent should use the calculator to divide -2 by 3 to find the second potential value of x.\n",
