    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation:\n   - Identify that we're dealing with an absolute value equation: |3x - 2| = 4\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value equations:\n   - An equation of the form |A| = B (where B is positive) is equivalent to two equations:\n     A = B or A = -B\n\n3. Apply this property to our equation:\n   - Set up two equations:\n     3x - 2 = 4   or   3x - 2 = -4\n\n4. Solve each equation separately:\n   - For 3x - 2 = 4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n   - For 3x - 2 = -4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - Identify which solution yields the smaller value of x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the smaller x value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies |3x - 2| = 4\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations that can be easily performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress, we have successfully solved both equations derived from |3x - 2| = 4:\n\n1. From 3x - 2 = 4, we found x = 2\n2.
