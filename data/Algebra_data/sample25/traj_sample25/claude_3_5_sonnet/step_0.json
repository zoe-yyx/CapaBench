    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation:\n   - Identify that we're dealing with an absolute value equation: |3x - 2| = 4\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value equations:\n   - An equation of the form |A| = B (where B is positive) is equivalent to two equations:\n     A = B or A = -B\n\n3. Apply this property to our equation:\n   - Set up two equations:\n     3x - 2 = 4   or   3x - 2 = -4\n\n4. Solve each equation separately:\n   - For 3x - 2 = 4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n   - For 3x - 2 = -4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - Identify which solution yields the smaller value of x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the smaller x value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies |3x - 2| = 4\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations that can be easily performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe should start by applying the property of absolute value equations to our original equation |3x - 2| = 4. This will give us two separate equations to solve:\n\n1. 3x - 2 = 4\n2. 3x - 2 = -4\n\nLet's focus on solving the first equation: 3x - 2 = 4\n\nTo solve this, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by:\n1. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation\n2. Then dividing both sides by 3\n\nThis will give us one potential value for x. After solving this equation, we'll need to solve the second equation (3x - 2 = -4) in a similar manner to find the other potential value for x.\n\nOnce we have both values, we can compare them to determine which is smaller, as the question asks for the smallest value of x that satisfies the original equation.\n\nFor the next action, the acting agent should use a calculator to solve the equation 3x - 2 = 4, following the steps outlined above.\n",
