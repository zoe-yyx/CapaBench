    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation:\n   - Identify that we're dealing with an absolute value equation: |3x - 2| = 4\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value equations:\n   - An equation of the form |A| = B (where B is positive) is equivalent to two equations:\n     A = B or A = -B\n\n3. Apply this property to our equation:\n   - Set up two equations:\n     3x - 2 = 4   or   3x - 2 = -4\n\n4. Solve each equation separately:\n   - For 3x - 2 = 4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n   - For 3x - 2 = -4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - Identify which solution yields the smaller value of x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the smaller x value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies |3x - 2| = 4\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations that can be easily performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical action and the current progress, we've completed the first step in solving the equation 3x - 2 = 4. We've added 2 to both sides, resulting in 3x = 6.\n\nNow, we need to continue with the next step of our plan for this equation:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have our first potential value for x.\n\nFor the next action, the acting agent should use the calculator to divide 6 by 3. This will give us the value of x for the first equation.\n\nOnce we have this result, we'll need to repeat a similar process for the second equation (3x - 2 = -4) to find the other potential value of x.\n\nAfter both values are calculated, we can compare them to determine the smallest value of x that satisfies the original equation |3x - 2| = 4.\n",
