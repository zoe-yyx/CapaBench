    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation:\n   - Identify that we're dealing with an absolute value equation: |3x - 2| = 4\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value equations:\n   - An equation of the form |A| = B (where B is positive) is equivalent to two equations:\n     A = B or A = -B\n\n3. Apply this property to our equation:\n   - Set up two equations:\n     3x - 2 = 4   or   3x - 2 = -4\n\n4. Solve each equation separately:\n   - For 3x - 2 = 4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n   - For 3x - 2 = -4:\n     a) Add 2 to both sides\n     b) Divide both sides by 3\n\n5. Compare the solutions:\n   - Identify which solution yields the smaller value of x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the smaller x value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies |3x - 2| = 4\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic operations that can be easily performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our current progress, we have successfully solved the equation and verified our solution. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We split the absolute value equation |3x - 2| = 4 into two linear equations:\n   3x - 2 = 4 and 3x - 2 = -4\n\n2. We solved both equations:\n   From 3x - 2 = 4, we got x = 2\n   From 3x - 2 = -4, we got x = -2/3 \u2248 -0.666666666666667\n\n3. We compared these values and identified that -2/3 is the smaller value.\n\n4. We verified our solution by plugging x = -2/3 back into the original equation:\n   |-2/3 * 3 - 2| = |-2 - 2| = |-4| = 4\n\nThe calculator confirmed that this equals 4, which matches the right-hand side of our original equation.\n\nTherefore, we have successfully found and verified that the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation |3x - 2| = 4 is x = -2/3.\n\nAt this point, our problem-solving process is complete. We have answered the original question and verified our solution. No further calculations or actions are needed.\n",
