Recall the formula for the magnitude of a complex number:\n   For a complex number z = a + bi, its magnitude |z| = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\n2. Identify the real and imaginary parts of the given complex number:\n   a = 3 (real part)\n   b = 4 (imaginary part)\n\n3. Apply the magnitude formula:\n   |z| = \u221a(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2)\n\n4. Calculate the squares inside the square root:\n   3\u00b2 = 9\n   4\u00b2 = 16\n\n5. Sum the squared values:\n   9 + 16 = 25\n\n6. Calculate the square root of the sum:\n   \u221a25\n\n7. Simplify the result to get the final answer.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within a few steps, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and the fundamental definition of complex number magnitude.\n",

We've calculated that 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 25\n3. So now we have |z| = \u221a25\n\nTherefore, the next logical operation is to calculate the square root of 25. This will give us our final answer for the magnitude of the complex number z = 3 + 4i.\n\nI suggest the acting agent use a calculator to compute \u221a25 as the next operation.
