    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |2x - 5| < 9:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress we've made and the results of our calculations, we now have the complete solution to our compound inequality:\n\n-2 < x < 7\n\nThis solution directly corresponds to the original inequality |2x - 5| < 9. \n\nOur next steps should focus on:\n\n1. Expressing this solution in interval notation, which is a key part of our original problem statement.\n\n2. Verifying our solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval. This will ensure the accuracy of our work and fulfill step 8 of our planning strategy.\n\n3. Preparing to present the final answer in the requested format, as mentioned in step 10 of our plan.\n\nFor the interval notation, we need to use parentheses to indicate that -2 and 7 are not included in the solution (because the original inequality used a strict inequality \"<\" rather than \"\u2264\").\n\nFor verification, we should test:\n- A value slightly greater than -2 (e.g., -1.9)\n- A value slightly less than 7 (e.g., 6.9)\n- A value in the middle of the interval (e.g., 2.5)\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with expressing the solution in interval notation and then use a calculator to verify these test values in the original inequality |2x - 5| < 9.\n",
