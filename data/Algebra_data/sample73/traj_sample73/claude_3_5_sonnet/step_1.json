    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |2x - 5| < 9:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we should now focus on solving the compound inequality -9 < 2x - 5 < 9. To isolate x, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Add 5 to all parts of the inequality. This will eliminate the constant term on the left side of x.\n   -9 + 5 < 2x - 5 + 5 < 9 + 5\n   -4 < 2x < 14\n\n2. Now that we have -4 < 2x < 14, we need to divide all parts by 2 to isolate x.\n   -4/2 < 2x/2 < 14/2\n\nThis will give us the range of x values that satisfy the original inequality. After these calculations, we'll be able to express the solution in interval notation.\n\nThe acting agent should perform these calculations using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n",
