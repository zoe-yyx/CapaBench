    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |2x - 5| < 9:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the progress so far, we've successfully solved the left side of our compound inequality. We now have -2 < x from the calculation -4/2 = -2. \n\nTo complete the solution, we need to focus on the right side of the inequality. We should continue with the division by 2 that we started in the previous step.\n\nOur next logical step is to calculate 14/2, which will give us the upper bound for x. Once we have this value, we'll have the complete range for x that satisfies the original inequality |2x - 5| < 9.\n\nAfter obtaining this upper bound, we'll be able to express the full solution as an interval, which was one of our final goals in the planning strategy.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division for precision.\n",
