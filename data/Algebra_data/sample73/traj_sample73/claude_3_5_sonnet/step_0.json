Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by applying the absolute value inequality property. This is a crucial step in solving absolute value inequalities.\n\nLet's reason through this:\n\n1. We have the inequality |2x - 5| < 9\n2. Using the property of absolute value inequalities, we can rewrite this as:\n   -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\nThis step transforms our single inequality with an absolute value into a compound inequality without absolute values. This is easier to solve using standard algebraic techniques.\n\nOur next logical step would be to solve this compound inequality by isolating x on both sides. This will involve adding 5 to all parts of the inequality and then dividing all parts by 2.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these algebraic manipulations to solve for x.\n",
