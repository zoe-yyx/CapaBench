    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |2x - 5| < 9:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the original problem, our solving process, and the reflection information provided, we can reason through the final step as follows:\n\n1. We have correctly solved the inequality |2x - 5| < 9 and verified our solution.\n\n2. Our solution interval (-2, 7) is mathematically correct.\n\n3. The reflection highlighted that our previous answer was too verbose and did not strictly adhere to the format requested in the original problem.\n\n4. The original problem specifically asked to \"list the range of values for x in the form of intervals.\"\n\n5. In mathematical notation, intervals are typically expressed using parentheses or brackets, without additional explanatory text.\n\n6. The open parentheses in (-2, 7) correctly indicate that the boundary points are not included in the solution set, which aligns with the strict inequality (<) in the original problem.\n\nTherefore, to fully address the original problem and incorporate the feedback from the reflection, the acting agent should present the final answer solely as the interval notation, without any additional explanation. This approach will satisfy the requirement to \"list the range of values for x in the form of intervals\" in the most concise and mathematically precise manner.\n",
