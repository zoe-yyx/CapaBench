    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |2x - 5| < 9:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress we've made so far and the planning strategy, we have successfully solved the compound inequality and found the range of x values that satisfy the original inequality |2x - 5| < 9. We have determined that:\n\n-2 < x < 7\n\nNow, we need to focus on the final steps of our plan:\n\n1. Verify the solution:\n   It would be wise to verify our solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval. This will ensure our solution is correct.\n\n2. Present the final answer:\n   We have already expressed the solution in interval notation as (-2, 7). However, we should confirm if this is the most appropriate form for the answer, considering the original question asked for \"the range of values for x in the form of intervals.\"\n\n3. Reflect on the process:\n   We should review our steps to ensure we've followed a logical process and haven't missed any crucial details.\n\nTo proceed, I suggest the acting agent perform the following:\n\n1. Verify the solution by testing the boundary values (-2 and 7) and a point within the interval (e.g., 0) in the original inequality |2x - 5| < 9.\n\n2. Double-check if the interval notation (-2, 7) is the most appropriate form for presenting the final answer, or if we need to provide any additional explanation.\n\nThese actions will help us finalize our solution and ensure its accuracy and completeness.\n",
