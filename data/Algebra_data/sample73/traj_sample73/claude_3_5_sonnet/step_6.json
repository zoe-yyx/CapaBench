    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |2x - 5| < 9:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the verification steps we've taken, let's analyze our results and reason through the final steps:\n\n1. Boundary verification:\n   - For x = -2: |2(-2) - 5| - 9 = 0\n   - For x = 7: |2(7) - 5| - 9 = 0\n   Both boundary values result in 0, confirming that -2 and 7 are indeed the exact boundaries of our solution set.\n\n2. We still need to verify a point within the interval. As suggested earlier, let's use x = 0.\n\n3. After verifying the internal point, we should interpret these results collectively:\n   - If |2(0) - 5| - 9 < 0, it will confirm that 0 (and by extension, all points between -2 and 7) satisfies the original inequality.\n\n4. Our solution in interval notation (-2, 7) appears to be correct. However, we should consider if the original question requires us to be more explicit about the inclusivity or exclusivity of the boundaries.\n\n5. Given that the original inequality uses a strict inequality (<) rather than a non-strict one (\u2264), our interval notation (-2, 7) is indeed the most appropriate form, as it indicates that the boundaries are not included in the solution set.\n\n6. To fully address the original problem, we should formulate a concise statement that combines the interval notation with a verbal description of the range.\n\nLet's proceed with verifying the internal point (x = 0) to complete our verification process. After that, we can formulate our final answer.\n",
