    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |2x - 5| < 9:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with an absolute value inequality.\n   - The goal is to find the range of x values that satisfy this inequality.\n\n2. Recall the properties of absolute value inequalities:\n   - For |a| < b, the solution is -b < a < b\n\n3. Apply the absolute value inequality property:\n   - Rewrite the inequality as: -9 < 2x - 5 < 9\n\n4. Solve the compound inequality:\n   - Solve the left side: -9 < 2x - 5\n   - Solve the right side: 2x - 5 < 9\n\n5. Isolate x in both inequalities:\n   - Add 5 to all parts of the inequality\n   - Divide all parts by 2\n\n6. Combine the results to get the final solution range for x\n\n7. Express the solution in interval notation\n\n8. Verify the solution by testing boundary values and a point within the interval\n\n9. Reflect on the process and ensure all steps are logically connected\n\n10. Present the final answer in the requested format\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our progress so far, we have successfully solved the inequality and expressed the solution in interval notation. Now, we need to verify our solution and ensure it's correct. Let's reason through the verification process:\n\n1. We've already checked one boundary value (-2) in the last action, which resulted in 0. This confirms that -2 is indeed on the boundary of our solution set.\n\n2. We should now check the other boundary value (7) and a point within the interval (as suggested earlier, we can use 0) to fully verify our solution.\n\n3. For x = 7:\n   We need to calculate |2(7) - 5| - 9\n   This will help us confirm if 7 is truly on the boundary of our solution set.\n\n4. For x = 0 (a point within the interval):\n   We need to calculate |2(0) - 5| - 9\n   This will help us confirm that a point within our interval indeed satisfies the original inequality.\n\n5. After these calculations, we should interpret the results to ensure they align with our solution.\n\n6. Finally, we should consider if any additional explanation is needed to accompany our interval notation (-2, 7) to fully answer the original question.\n\nLet's proceed with these calculations to complete our verification process.\n",
