    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current stage of problem-solving, we should focus on simplifying each fraction individually before combining like terms. Let's guide the acting agent through this process:\n\n1. For the first fraction $\\frac{12x^6}{3x^2}$:\n   - We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their common factor 3x^2.\n   - This will result in $4x^4$.\n\n2. For the second fraction $\\frac{8x^4}{2x}$:\n   - We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their common factor 2x.\n   - This will result in $4x^3$.\n\n3. The third term $-10x^3$ is already in its simplest form.\n\nAfter these simplifications, we'll have:\n\n$4x^4 + 4x^3 - 10x^3$\n\nNow, we can combine like terms:\n- The $4x^4$ term stands alone as it has the highest exponent.\n- We can combine $4x^3$ and $-10x^3$ as they have the same exponent.\n\nThis reasoning should guide the acting agent to perform these simplifications and combinations, leading to the final simplified expression.\n",
