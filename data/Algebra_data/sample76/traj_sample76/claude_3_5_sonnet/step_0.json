    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by simplifying each fraction individually. Let's begin with the first fraction $\\frac{12x^6}{3x^2}$.\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can:\n\n1. Divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).\n2. The GCF of 12 and 3 is 3.\n3. For the x terms, we can subtract the exponents: 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nThus, $\\frac{12x^6}{3x^2}$ simplifies to $4x^4$.\n\nNext, we should move on to simplifying the second fraction $\\frac{8x^4}{2x}$. We can apply the same process:\n\n1. Divide 8 by 2.\n2. Subtract the exponents: 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nThis gives us $4x^3$.\n\nAfter simplifying these fractions, we can combine like terms with the last term -10x^3.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these simplifications and then combine the terms.\n",
