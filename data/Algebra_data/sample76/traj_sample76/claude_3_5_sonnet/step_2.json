    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and historical actions, we should now focus on simplifying each fraction individually and then combining like terms. Let's guide the acting agent through this process:\n\n1. For the first fraction $\\frac{12x^6}{3x^2}$:\n   - Simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by their common factor 3x^2\n   - This will result in $4x^4$\n\n2. For the second fraction $\\frac{8x^4}{2x}$:\n   - Simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by their common factor 2x\n   - This will result in $4x^3$\n\n3. The third term is already simplified: $-10x^3$\n\n4. After simplification, we have:\n   $4x^4 + 4x^3 - 10x^3$\n\n5. Now, we need to combine like terms:\n   - The $4x^4$ term stands alone as it has the highest exponent\n   - The $4x^3$ and $-10x^3$ terms can be combined as they have the same exponent\n\n6. Combining like terms:\n   $4x^4 + (4x^3 - 10x^3)$ = $4x^4 - 6x^3$\n\n7. The final simplified expression should be:\n   $4x^4 - 6x^3$\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these simplifications and combinations step by step, and then present the final simplified expression.\n",
