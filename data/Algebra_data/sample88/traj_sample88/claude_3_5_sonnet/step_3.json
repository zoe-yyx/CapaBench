    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the current state of the problem, we've simplified the left side of the equation and are now at the stage of isolating b^(-1). Let's continue with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have the simplified equation: 5 - b^(-1) = 2\n\n2. To isolate b^(-1), we need to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n   5 - b^(-1) = 2\n   -b^(-1) = 2 - 5\n   -b^(-1) = -3\n\n3. Now, we need to multiply both sides by -1 to remove the negative sign from b^(-1):\n   b^(-1) = 3\n\n4. To solve for b, we need to take the reciprocal of both sides. This will eliminate the negative exponent on b:\n   b = 1/3\n\nThis reasoning leads us to the solution b = 1/3. The next step should be to verify this solution by substituting it back into the original equation.\n",
