    "reasoning": "\nGiven the simplified equation 5 - b^(-1) = 2 from the previous action, we can now proceed with isolating b^(-1) on one side of the equation. This will allow us to solve for b more easily.\n\nTo do this, we should:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will move the constant term to the right side.\n\n2. After subtracting, we'll have -b^(-1) on the left side and -3 on the right side.\n\n3. To eliminate the negative sign in front of b^(-1), we can multiply both sides by -1.\n\nThese steps will give us the equation in the form b^(-1) = 3, which sets us up perfectly for the next step in our solving process.\n\nThe acting agent should perform these algebraic manipulations to isolate b^(-1).\n",
