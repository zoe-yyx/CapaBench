    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, let's guide the acting agent through the initial steps of solving this equation:\n\n1. We need to simplify the left side of the equation, specifically the fraction 5^(-1) / 25^(-1).\n\n2. Recognize that 5^(-1) = 1/5 and 25^(-1) = 1/25.\n\n3. When dividing fractions, we multiply by the reciprocal. So, (1/5) / (1/25) becomes (1/5) * (25/1).\n\n4. This simplification will result in 5, as 25/5 = 5.\n\n5. After this simplification, our equation will look like:\n   5 - b^(-1) = 2\n\n6. The next step would be to isolate b^(-1) on one side of the equation.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on simplifying the fraction 5^(-1) / 25^(-1) to 5, and then rearrange the equation to isolate b^(-1).\n",
