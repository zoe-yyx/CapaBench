    "observation": "A function is given by $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. If the vertex of this parabola is at the point $(h, k)$ and it passes through the point $(p, q)$, express $a$ in terms of $h$, $k$, $p$, and $q$.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the vertex form of a quadratic function:\n   f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola\n\n2. Expand the vertex form to get the general form:\n   f(x) = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k\n\n3. Compare the expanded vertex form with the given general form:\n   ax^2 + bx + c = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k\n\n4. Identify the relationships:\n   b = -2ah\n   c = ah^2 + k\n\n5. Use the point (p, q) that the parabola passes through:\n   q = f(p) = a(p - h)^2 + k\n\n6. Rearrange the equation from step 5 to isolate 'a':\n   a = (q - k) / (p - h)^2\n\n7. This final expression gives 'a' in terms of h, k, p, and q\n\n8. Verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation\n\n9. If needed, simplify the expression for 'a'\n\n10. Present the final answer: a = (q - k) / (p - h)^2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, our next step should be to start with the vertex form of the quadratic function and work towards expressing 'a' in terms of h, k, p, and q. Here's the reasoning for the next operation:\n\n1. We know the vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex.\n\n2. We're also given that the point (p, q) lies on the parabola. This means we can substitute these values into the vertex form equation.\n\n3. The next logical step would be to substitute x = p and f(x) = q into the vertex form equation:\n   q = a(p - h)^2 + k\n\n4. This equation contains all the variables we need to express 'a' in terms of h, k, p, and q.\n\n5. To isolate 'a', we should subtract k from both sides and then divide by (p - h)^2.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on manipulating the equation q = a(p - h)^2 + k to solve for 'a'. This will directly lead us to the desired expression for 'a' in terms of h, k, p, and q.\n",
