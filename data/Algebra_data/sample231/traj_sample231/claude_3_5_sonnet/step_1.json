    "observation": "A function is given by $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. If the vertex of this parabola is at the point $(h, k)$ and it passes through the point $(p, q)$, express $a$ in terms of $h$, $k$, $p$, and $q$.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the vertex form of a quadratic function:\n   f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola\n\n2. Expand the vertex form to get the general form:\n   f(x) = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k\n\n3. Compare the expanded vertex form with the given general form:\n   ax^2 + bx + c = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k\n\n4. Identify the relationships:\n   b = -2ah\n   c = ah^2 + k\n\n5. Use the point (p, q) that the parabola passes through:\n   q = f(p) = a(p - h)^2 + k\n\n6. Rearrange the equation from step 5 to isolate 'a':\n   a = (q - k) / (p - h)^2\n\n7. This final expression gives 'a' in terms of h, k, p, and q\n\n8. Verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation\n\n9. If needed, simplify the expression for 'a'\n\n10. Present the final answer: a = (q - k) / (p - h)^2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we are on the right track to solve for 'a' in terms of h, k, p, and q. The previous action has set up the equation using the point (p, q) that the parabola passes through. Now, we need to isolate 'a' in this equation.\n\nLet's reason through the next steps:\n\n1. We have the equation: q = a(p - h)^2 + k\n\n2. To isolate 'a', we first need to subtract k from both sides:\n   q - k = a(p - h)^2\n\n3. Then, we can divide both sides by (p - h)^2 to isolate 'a':\n   (q - k) / (p - h)^2 = a\n\n4. This gives us the expression for 'a' in terms of h, k, p, and q, which matches step 6 in our planning strategy.\n\nThe next logical step would be to verify this solution by substituting it back into the original equation or the vertex form of the quadratic function. This will help ensure our derivation is correct.\n",
