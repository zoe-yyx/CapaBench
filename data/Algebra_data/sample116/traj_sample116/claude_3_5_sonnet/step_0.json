    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to start with the first step in our plan: understanding the given functions. We already have f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = 2x clearly defined.\n\nThe next crucial step is to find the inverse function of g(x), which is g^(-1)(x). This is necessary because we need to compose f with g^(-1).\n\nTo find g^(-1)(x), we need to solve the equation y = 2x for x. This will give us the expression for g^(-1)(x).\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to solve y = 2x for x to find g^(-1)(x). This can be done algebraically by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with this algebraic manipulation to find g^(-1)(x).\n",
