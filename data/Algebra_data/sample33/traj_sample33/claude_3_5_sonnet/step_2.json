    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Two unknown numbers\n   - Their product is 56\n   - Their sum is 15\n   - We need to find the smaller of the two numbers\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x be the smaller number\n   - Let y be the larger number\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 15 (sum)\n   - Equation 2: x * y = 56 (product)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Express y in terms of x using Equation 1:\n      y = 15 - x\n   b) Substitute this into Equation 2:\n      x * (15 - x) = 56\n   c) Expand the equation:\n      15x - x^2 = 56\n   d) Rearrange to standard quadratic form:\n      x^2 - 15x + 56 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   a) Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   b) a = 1, b = -15, c = 56\n   c) Calculate the solutions\n\n6. Identify the smaller of the two solutions as our answer\n\n7. Verify the result by checking if it satisfies both original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer: the smaller number\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation confirming that the discriminant is indeed 1, we can proceed with solving the quadratic equation. Our next steps in the reasoning process are:\n\n1. Apply the quadratic formula using the calculated discriminant:\n   x = [-(-15) \u00b1 \u221a1] / (2*1)\n   x = (15 \u00b1 1) / 2\n\n2. This will give us two solutions:\n   x1 = (15 + 1) / 2 = 16 / 2\n   x2 = (15 - 1) / 2 = 14 / 2\n\n3. We need to calculate these values to find the two roots of the equation.\n\n4. Once we have the two roots, we'll identify the smaller one as our answer, since the question asks for the smaller of the two numbers.\n\n5. After finding the smaller number, we should verify that it satisfies the original conditions:\n   - The sum of the two numbers should be 15\n   - The product of the two numbers should be 56\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to perform these calculations and verify the results.\n",
