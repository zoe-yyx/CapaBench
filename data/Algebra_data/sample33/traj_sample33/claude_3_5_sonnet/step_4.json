    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Two unknown numbers\n   - Their product is 56\n   - Their sum is 15\n   - We need to find the smaller of the two numbers\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x be the smaller number\n   - Let y be the larger number\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 15 (sum)\n   - Equation 2: x * y = 56 (product)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Express y in terms of x using Equation 1:\n      y = 15 - x\n   b) Substitute this into Equation 2:\n      x * (15 - x) = 56\n   c) Expand the equation:\n      15x - x^2 = 56\n   d) Rearrange to standard quadratic form:\n      x^2 - 15x + 56 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   a) Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   b) a = 1, b = -15, c = 56\n   c) Calculate the solutions\n\n6. Identify the smaller of the two solutions as our answer\n\n7. Verify the result by checking if it satisfies both original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer: the smaller number\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations we've performed so far, we have identified both roots of our quadratic equation:\n\nx1 = 8 (calculated in the previous step)\nx2 = 7 (just calculated)\n\nNow, we can proceed with our reasoning:\n\n1. We have found both numbers that satisfy our original equations.\n\n2. The question asks for the smaller of the two numbers, which is clearly 7.\n\n3. To ensure our solution is correct, we should verify that these numbers satisfy the original conditions:\n\n   a) Sum condition: The sum of the two numbers should be 15\n      We need to calculate 7 + 8\n\n   b) Product condition: The product of the two numbers should be 56\n      We need to calculate 7 * 8\n\n4. If both conditions are met, we can confidently state that 7 is the correct answer to the original problem.\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to perform these verification calculations:\n- Calculate 7 + 8 to verify the sum condition\n- Calculate 7 * 8 to verify the product condition\n",
