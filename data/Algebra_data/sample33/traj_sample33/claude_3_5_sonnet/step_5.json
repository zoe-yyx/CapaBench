    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Two unknown numbers\n   - Their product is 56\n   - Their sum is 15\n   - We need to find the smaller of the two numbers\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x be the smaller number\n   - Let y be the larger number\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 15 (sum)\n   - Equation 2: x * y = 56 (product)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Express y in terms of x using Equation 1:\n      y = 15 - x\n   b) Substitute this into Equation 2:\n      x * (15 - x) = 56\n   c) Expand the equation:\n      15x - x^2 = 56\n   d) Rearrange to standard quadratic form:\n      x^2 - 15x + 56 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   a) Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   b) a = 1, b = -15, c = 56\n   c) Calculate the solutions\n\n6. Identify the smaller of the two solutions as our answer\n\n7. Verify the result by checking if it satisfies both original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer: the smaller number\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and verifications, we have made significant progress in solving the problem. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We have successfully found both roots of our quadratic equation:\n   x1 = 8 and x2 = 7\n\n2. We've identified that 7 is the smaller of the two numbers, which is what the question asks for.\n\n3. We've verified the sum condition:\n   7 + 8 = 15, which matches the given condition that the sum of the two numbers is 15.\n\n4. The next logical step is to verify the product condition. We need to confirm that the product of these two numbers is indeed 56, as stated in the original problem.\n\n5. If this final condition is met, we can confidently conclude that 7 is the correct answer to the problem.\n\n6. After this verification, we will have fully solved the problem and can present our final answer with certainty.\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to perform the final crucial calculation:\n- Calculate 7 * 8 to verify the product condition\n",
