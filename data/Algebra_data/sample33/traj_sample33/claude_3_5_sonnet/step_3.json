    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Two unknown numbers\n   - Their product is 56\n   - Their sum is 15\n   - We need to find the smaller of the two numbers\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x be the smaller number\n   - Let y be the larger number\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 15 (sum)\n   - Equation 2: x * y = 56 (product)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Express y in terms of x using Equation 1:\n      y = 15 - x\n   b) Substitute this into Equation 2:\n      x * (15 - x) = 56\n   c) Expand the equation:\n      15x - x^2 = 56\n   d) Rearrange to standard quadratic form:\n      x^2 - 15x + 56 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   a) Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   b) a = 1, b = -15, c = 56\n   c) Calculate the solutions\n\n6. Identify the smaller of the two solutions as our answer\n\n7. Verify the result by checking if it satisfies both original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer: the smaller number\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We have already calculated one of the roots: x1 = (15 + 1) / 2 = 8\n\n2. We now need to calculate the second root:\n   x2 = (15 - 1) / 2 = 14 / 2\n\n3. After calculating x2, we will have both roots of the quadratic equation.\n\n4. Since the question asks for the smaller of the two numbers, we will compare x1 and x2 to determine which is smaller.\n\n5. Once we identify the smaller number, we should verify that it satisfies the original conditions:\n   - The sum of this number and its pair should be 15\n   - The product of this number and its pair should be 56\n\n6. To verify, we'll need to calculate:\n   - The sum of the two roots (should equal 15)\n   - The product of the two roots (should equal 56)\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to:\na) Calculate (15 - 1) / 2 to find x2\nb) Compare x1 (8) and x2 to determine the smaller number\nc) Calculate the sum of x1 and x2\nd) Calculate the product of x1 and x2\n",
