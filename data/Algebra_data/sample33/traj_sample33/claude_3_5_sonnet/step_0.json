    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Two unknown numbers\n   - Their product is 56\n   - Their sum is 15\n   - We need to find the smaller of the two numbers\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x be the smaller number\n   - Let y be the larger number\n\n3. Create equations based on the given information:\n   - Equation 1: x + y = 15 (sum)\n   - Equation 2: x * y = 56 (product)\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Express y in terms of x using Equation 1:\n      y = 15 - x\n   b) Substitute this into Equation 2:\n      x * (15 - x) = 56\n   c) Expand the equation:\n      15x - x^2 = 56\n   d) Rearrange to standard quadratic form:\n      x^2 - 15x + 56 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   a) Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   b) a = 1, b = -15, c = 56\n   c) Calculate the solutions\n\n6. Identify the smaller of the two solutions as our answer\n\n7. Verify the result by checking if it satisfies both original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer: the smaller number\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to follow the plan and set up our equations. We've already identified that we'll use x for the smaller number and y for the larger number. Our two key equations are:\n\n1. x + y = 15 (sum equation)\n2. x * y = 56 (product equation)\n\nThe next logical step is to solve this system of equations. We can do this by substituting the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation. This will give us a quadratic equation in terms of x only.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this substitution and set up the quadratic equation. We'll need to:\n\n1. Express y in terms of x using the sum equation: y = 15 - x\n2. Substitute this into the product equation: x * (15 - x) = 56\n3. Expand this equation to get: 15x - x^2 = 56\n4. Rearrange to standard quadratic form: x^2 - 15x + 56 = 0\n\nOnce we have this quadratic equation, we'll be ready to solve it in the next step.\n",
