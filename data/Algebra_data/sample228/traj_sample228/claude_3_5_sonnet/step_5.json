Identify the expression to be computed:\n   (f(x))^2 - (g(x))^2 + h(x)\n\n3. Evaluate each polynomial at x = 1:\n   - Calculate f(1)\n   - Calculate g(1)\n   - Calculate h(1)\n\n4. Square the results for f(1) and g(1):\n   - Calculate (f(1))^2\n   - Calculate (g(1))^2\n\n5. Substitute the values into the main expression:\n   (f(1))^2 - (g(1))^2 + h(1)\n\n6. Perform the final calculation to get the result.\n\n7. Double-check the calculations and ensure the answer is correct.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for precise calculations at each step to avoid errors in arithmetic.\n",
