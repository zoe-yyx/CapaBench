Identify the expression to be computed:\n   (f(x))^2 - (g(x))^2 + h(x)\n\n3. Evaluate each polynomial at x = 1:\n   - Calculate f(1)\n   - Calculate g(1)\n   - Calculate h(1)\n\n4. Square the results for f(1) and g(1):\n   - Calculate (f(1))^2\n   - Calculate (g(1))^2\n\n5. Substitute the values into the main expression:\n   (f(1))^2 - (g(1))^2 + h(1)\n\n6. Perform the final calculation to get the result.\n\n7. Double-check the calculations and ensure the answer is correct.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for precise calculations at each step to avoid errors in arithmetic.\n",

We know that g(1) = 8, so we need to compute 8^2.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have all the necessary components to substitute into our main expression:\n\n(f(1))^2 - (g(1))^2 + h(1)\n\nOnce we have (g(1))^2, we can proceed to the final step of substituting all values into this expression and performing the final calculation.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to compute 8^2.
