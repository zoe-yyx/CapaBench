    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving $4^{x+2} = 64$:\n\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have an exponential equation with base 4\n   - The exponent is (x+2)\n   - The result is 64\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   - Recognize that 64 can be expressed as a power of 4\n   - 64 = 4^3\n\n3. Equate the exponents:\n   - Since 4^(x+2) = 4^3, the exponents must be equal\n   - Set up the equation: x + 2 = 3\n\n4. Solve for x:\n   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation\n\n6. Present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use basic arithmetic operations, which can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the result from the previous calculation, we now know that log_4(64) = 3. This means we can rewrite our original equation as:\n\n4^(x+2) = 4^3\n\nThis is a crucial step because when we have the same base (in this case, 4) on both sides of an equation, the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true.\n\nTherefore, our next logical step is to set up an equation equating the exponents:\n\nx + 2 = 3\n\nThis simplification allows us to solve for x directly. The acting agent should now focus on solving this linear equation by isolating x on one side.\n\nTo do this, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. This operation will isolate x and give us its value.\n\nThe acting agent should perform this subtraction: 3 - 2\n\nThis will give us the final value of x.\n",
