    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving $4^{x+2} = 64$:\n\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have an exponential equation with base 4\n   - The exponent is (x+2)\n   - The result is 64\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   - Recognize that 64 can be expressed as a power of 4\n   - 64 = 4^3\n\n3. Equate the exponents:\n   - Since 4^(x+2) = 4^3, the exponents must be equal\n   - Set up the equation: x + 2 = 3\n\n4. Solve for x:\n   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation\n\n6. Present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use basic arithmetic operations, which can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the results obtained, we have successfully simplified the original equation and solved for x. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We started with the equation 4^(x+2) = 64\n2. We found that log_4(64) = 3, which means 64 = 4^3\n3. This allowed us to rewrite the equation as 4^(x+2) = 4^3\n4. Since the bases are the same, we equated the exponents: x + 2 = 3\n5. We then solved this linear equation by subtracting 2 from both sides: 3 - 2 = 1\n\nTherefore, we have found that x = 1.\n\nTo complete our solution and ensure its correctness, we should verify this result by substituting it back into the original equation. This verification step is crucial in mathematical problem-solving to confirm the accuracy of our solution.\n\nThe acting agent should now substitute x = 1 into the original equation 4^(x+2) = 64 to verify that it holds true. This will involve calculating 4^(1+2), which is 4^3, and comparing the result to 64.\n",
