    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving $4^{x+2} = 64$:\n\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have an exponential equation with base 4\n   - The exponent is (x+2)\n   - The result is 64\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   - Recognize that 64 can be expressed as a power of 4\n   - 64 = 4^3\n\n3. Equate the exponents:\n   - Since 4^(x+2) = 4^3, the exponents must be equal\n   - Set up the equation: x + 2 = 3\n\n4. Solve for x:\n   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation\n\n6. Present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use basic arithmetic operations, which can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the equation 4^(x+2) = 64, our first step should be to simplify the right side of the equation. We know that 64 is a perfect square and can be expressed as a power of 4. \n\nTo determine this, we need to find the logarithm of 64 with base 4. This will tell us what power of 4 equals 64.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute log_4(64). This will give us the exponent we need to proceed with solving the equation.\n\nOnce we have this value, we can rewrite the equation in the form 4^(x+2) = 4^n, where n is the result of our calculation. This will allow us to equate the exponents in the next step.\n",
