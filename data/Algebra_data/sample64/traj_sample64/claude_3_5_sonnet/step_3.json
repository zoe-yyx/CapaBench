    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving $4^{x+2} = 64$:\n\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have an exponential equation with base 4\n   - The exponent is (x+2)\n   - The result is 64\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   - Recognize that 64 can be expressed as a power of 4\n   - 64 = 4^3\n\n3. Equate the exponents:\n   - Since 4^(x+2) = 4^3, the exponents must be equal\n   - Set up the equation: x + 2 = 3\n\n4. Solve for x:\n   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation\n\n6. Present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use basic arithmetic operations, which can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the current state of our problem-solving process, we have successfully solved for x and found that x = 1. However, our verification step encountered an issue. The calculator didn't evaluate the expression 4^(1+2) as expected, but instead returned the expression itself.\n\nTo complete our verification, we need to break down this calculation into two steps:\n\n1. First, we need to evaluate 1 + 2 inside the parentheses.\n2. Then, we need to calculate 4 raised to the power of that result.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate 1 + 2\n2. Use the result from step 1 to calculate 4 raised to that power\n\nThis approach will allow us to verify if 4^(1+2) indeed equals 64, confirming our solution that x = 1 is correct for the original equation 4^(x+2) = 64.\n\nAfter these calculations, we should be able to conclude our problem-solving process and present the final, verified answer.\n",
