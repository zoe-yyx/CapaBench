    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Arithmetic Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key components of the arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a\u2081) = 7\n   - Common difference (d) = 3\n   - Number of terms (n) = 50\n\n2. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   S_n = (n/2) * (a\u2081 + a_n)\n   Where a_n is the last term of the sequence\n\n3. Calculate the last term (a_n) of the sequence:\n   - Use the formula: a_n = a\u2081 + (n - 1)d\n   - Substitute known values and calculate\n\n4. Apply the sum formula:\n   - Substitute the values for n, a\u2081, and a_n\n   - Perform the calculation to find the sum\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using an alternative method (like the calculator's sum function) to double-check the answer\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Ensure the sum is clearly stated and matches the question asked\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent should be able to use a calculator for the arithmetic operations involved.\n",
