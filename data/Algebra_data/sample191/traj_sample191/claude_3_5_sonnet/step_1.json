    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Arithmetic Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key components of the arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a\u2081) = 7\n   - Common difference (d) = 3\n   - Number of terms (n) = 50\n\n2. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   S_n = (n/2) * (a\u2081 + a_n)\n   Where a_n is the last term of the sequence\n\n3. Calculate the last term (a_n) of the sequence:\n   - Use the formula: a_n = a\u2081 + (n - 1)d\n   - Substitute known values and calculate\n\n4. Apply the sum formula:\n   - Substitute the values for n, a\u2081, and a_n\n   - Perform the calculation to find the sum\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using an alternative method (like the calculator's sum function) to double-check the answer\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Ensure the sum is clearly stated and matches the question asked\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent should be able to use a calculator for the arithmetic operations involved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the last term (a\u2085\u2080) of the sequence to be 154, we can proceed to use the sum formula for arithmetic sequences.\n\nThe formula we need is: S_n = (n/2) * (a\u2081 + a_n)\n\nWe have all the necessary components:\n- n = 50 (number of terms)\n- a\u2081 = 7 (first term)\n- a_n = a\u2085\u2080 = 154 (last term, which we just calculated)\n\nOur next step should be to substitute these values into the formula and perform the calculation. This will give us the sum of the first 50 terms, which is the answer to our original problem.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to calculate:\nS_50 = (50/2) * (7 + 154)\n\nThis calculation will give us the final answer we're looking for.\n",
