Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have a complex expression with exponents inside parentheses, raised to the 8th power.\n   - The goal is to simplify and find the final exponent of x.\n\n2. Simplify inside the parentheses:\n   - Combine the exponents in the numerator (x^(1/2) and x^3)\n   - Subtract the exponent in the denominator (x^(3/4))\n   - Use the laws of exponents for multiplication and division\n\n3. Apply the outer exponent:\n   - After simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, apply the power of 8 to the result\n\n4. Simplify the final expression:\n   - Multiply the exponent inside the parentheses by 8\n   - This will give the final exponent of x\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - State the exponent of x in the simplified expression\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any necessary arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions in the exponents.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the problem and the planning strategy, let's guide the acting agent through the reasoning process:\n\n1. We need to start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses. This involves combining the exponents in the numerator and subtracting the exponent in the denominator.\n\n2. In the numerator, we have x^(1/2) * x^3. When multiplying terms with the same base, we add the exponents. So this becomes x^(1/2 + 3) = x^(7/2).\n\n3. Now we have (x^(7/2)) / (x^(3/4)). When dividing terms with the same base, we subtract the exponents. So this becomes x^(7/2 - 3/4).\n\n4. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this subtraction: 7/2 - 3/4.\n\n5. After simplifying the inside of the parentheses, we'll have x raised to some power. Let's call this power 'a' for now. So we have (x^a)^8.\n\n6. When raising a power to a power, we multiply the exponents. So our final expression will be x^(8a).\n\n7. The value of 'a' that we calculate in step 4 will determine our final answer when multiplied by 8.\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to perform the subtraction 7/2 - 3/4, and then multiply the result by 8 to get the final exponent.\n",
