    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have a complex expression with exponents inside parentheses, raised to the 8th power.\n   - The goal is to simplify and find the final exponent of x.\n\n2. Simplify inside the parentheses:\n   - Combine the exponents in the numerator (x^(1/2) and x^3)\n   - Subtract the exponent in the denominator (x^(3/4))\n   - Use the laws of exponents for multiplication and division\n\n3. Apply the outer exponent:\n   - After simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, apply the power of 8 to the result\n\n4. Simplify the final expression:\n   - Multiply the exponent inside the parentheses by 8\n   - This will give the final exponent of x\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - State the exponent of x in the simplified expression\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any necessary arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions in the exponents.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations performed, we can now finalize our reasoning:\n\n1. We have successfully simplified the expression inside the parentheses to x^2.75.\n\n2. We then applied the outer exponent of 8, resulting in (x^2.75)^8.\n\n3. Using the law of exponents that states when raising a power to a power, we multiply the exponents, we calculated 2.75 * 8.\n\n4. The result of this calculation is 22, which means our final simplified expression is x^22.\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that when the original expression \n   (x^(1/2) * x^3 / x^(3/4))^8 is simplified, the exponent of x is 22.\n\nThis completes our reasoning process. The acting agent can now present this as the final answer: the exponent of x in the simplified expression is 22.\n",
