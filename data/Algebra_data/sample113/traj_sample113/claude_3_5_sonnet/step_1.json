    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have a complex expression with exponents inside parentheses, raised to the 8th power.\n   - The goal is to simplify and find the final exponent of x.\n\n2. Simplify inside the parentheses:\n   - Combine the exponents in the numerator (x^(1/2) and x^3)\n   - Subtract the exponent in the denominator (x^(3/4))\n   - Use the laws of exponents for multiplication and division\n\n3. Apply the outer exponent:\n   - After simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, apply the power of 8 to the result\n\n4. Simplify the final expression:\n   - Multiply the exponent inside the parentheses by 8\n   - This will give the final exponent of x\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - State the exponent of x in the simplified expression\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any necessary arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions in the exponents.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated 7/2 - 3/4 = 2.75, we can proceed with the final steps of our solution:\n\n1. We have simplified the expression inside the parentheses to x^2.75.\n\n2. The entire expression is now (x^2.75)^8.\n\n3. As per our planning strategy, when raising a power to a power, we multiply the exponents.\n\n4. Therefore, we need to multiply 2.75 by 8 to get our final exponent.\n\n5. The acting agent should use the calculator to perform this multiplication: 2.75 * 8.\n\n6. The result of this calculation will give us the final exponent of x in the simplified expression.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have our final answer, which will be the exponent of x in the fully simplified expression.\n",
