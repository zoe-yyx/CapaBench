    "observation": "A school has 450 students and the ratio of boys to girls is 4 to 5. If each boy has 3 books and each girl has 5 books, how many books are there in total?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total number of students: 450\n   - Ratio of boys to girls: 4:5\n   - Books per boy: 3\n   - Books per girl: 5\n\n2. Calculate the number of boys and girls:\n   - Set up a ratio equation to find the number of boys and girls\n   - Use the total number of students to solve the equation\n\n3. Calculate the total number of books for boys:\n   - Multiply the number of boys by 3 (books per boy)\n\n4. Calculate the total number of books for girls:\n   - Multiply the number of girls by 5 (books per girl)\n\n5. Sum up the total number of books:\n   - Add the total books for boys and total books for girls\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the initial information\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result, we now know that the number of boys in the school is 200. This is a crucial piece of information that allows us to proceed with the next steps of our problem-solving strategy.\n\nGiven that we have 200 boys, and the total number of students is 450, we can easily deduce the number of girls:\n\n450 - 200 = 250 girls\n\nNow that we have the number of boys and girls, we can move on to calculating the total number of books. According to the problem:\n- Each boy has 3 books\n- Each girl has 5 books\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate:\n1. The total number of books the boys have\n2. The total number of books the girls have\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the calculator for these calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of books for boys: 200 * 3\n2. Calculate the total number of books for girls: 250 * 5\n\nThese calculations will give us the subtotals we need to find the final answer.\n",
