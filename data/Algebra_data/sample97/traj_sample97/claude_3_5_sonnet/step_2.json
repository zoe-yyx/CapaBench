    "observation": "A school has 450 students and the ratio of boys to girls is 4 to 5. If each boy has 3 books and each girl has 5 books, how many books are there in total?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total number of students: 450\n   - Ratio of boys to girls: 4:5\n   - Books per boy: 3\n   - Books per girl: 5\n\n2. Calculate the number of boys and girls:\n   - Set up a ratio equation to find the number of boys and girls\n   - Use the total number of students to solve the equation\n\n3. Calculate the total number of books for boys:\n   - Multiply the number of boys by 3 (books per boy)\n\n4. Calculate the total number of books for girls:\n   - Multiply the number of girls by 5 (books per girl)\n\n5. Sum up the total number of books:\n   - Add the total books for boys and total books for girls\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the initial information\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result, we now know that the total number of books for boys is 600. This is an important intermediate step in solving our problem. \n\nNow, we need to focus on calculating the total number of books for girls. We previously determined that there are 250 girls, and each girl has 5 books. \n\nThe next logical step is to calculate the total number of books for girls by multiplying 250 by 5. This will give us the second subtotal we need.\n\nAfter obtaining this result, we will have both subtotals (books for boys and books for girls) necessary to calculate the final answer.\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to use the calculator to perform this multiplication: 250 * 5.\n\nOnce we have this result, we'll be ready to sum up the total number of books by adding the books for boys (which we already know is 600) and the books for girls (which we're about to calculate).\n",
