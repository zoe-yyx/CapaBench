    "observation": "A school has 450 students and the ratio of boys to girls is 4 to 5. If each boy has 3 books and each girl has 5 books, how many books are there in total?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total number of students: 450\n   - Ratio of boys to girls: 4:5\n   - Books per boy: 3\n   - Books per girl: 5\n\n2. Calculate the number of boys and girls:\n   - Set up a ratio equation to find the number of boys and girls\n   - Use the total number of students to solve the equation\n\n3. Calculate the total number of books for boys:\n   - Multiply the number of boys by 3 (books per boy)\n\n4. Calculate the total number of books for girls:\n   - Multiply the number of girls by 5 (books per girl)\n\n5. Sum up the total number of books:\n   - Add the total books for boys and total books for girls\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the initial information\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, we should start by calculating the number of boys and girls in the school. This is a crucial step as it will allow us to determine how many books each group has.\n\nTo do this, we need to set up a ratio equation. We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:5, and the total number of students is 450. Let's call the number of boys 'x'. Then:\n\nx + (5/4)x = 450\n\nThis equation represents the total number of students (boys + girls) equaling 450. We need to solve this equation to find the number of boys (x) and then calculate the number of girls.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to solve this equation. We should guide the acting agent to use a calculator to solve this equation and find the values for the number of boys and girls.\n",
