    "observation": "A school has 450 students and the ratio of boys to girls is 4 to 5. If each boy has 3 books and each girl has 5 books, how many books are there in total?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total number of students: 450\n   - Ratio of boys to girls: 4:5\n   - Books per boy: 3\n   - Books per girl: 5\n\n2. Calculate the number of boys and girls:\n   - Set up a ratio equation to find the number of boys and girls\n   - Use the total number of students to solve the equation\n\n3. Calculate the total number of books for boys:\n   - Multiply the number of boys by 3 (books per boy)\n\n4. Calculate the total number of books for girls:\n   - Multiply the number of girls by 5 (books per girl)\n\n5. Sum up the total number of books:\n   - Add the total books for boys and total books for girls\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Check if the result makes sense given the initial information\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated the number of books for both boys and girls:\n- Boys: 200 boys \u00d7 3 books each = 600 books\n- Girls: 250 girls \u00d7 5 books each = 1250 books\n\nNow, we have all the necessary subtotals to determine the total number of books in the school. The next logical step is to add these two numbers together to get our final answer.\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to use the calculator to add 600 (total books for boys) and 1250 (total books for girls). This sum will give us the total number of books in the school, which is the answer to our original problem.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have completed all the steps in our planning strategy and solved the problem. The only remaining task would be to verify the answer, ensuring all calculations are correct and the result makes sense given the initial information.\n",
