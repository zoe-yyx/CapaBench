    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the function:\n   - Analyze the given function: $y=\\frac{5}{x^2 - 7x + 10}$\n   - Recognize that this is a rational function\n\n2. Identify the conditions for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0$\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n   - Identify a, b, and c: a = 1, b = -7, c = 10\n   - Calculate the discriminant: $b^2 - 4ac$\n   - Solve for x\n\n4. Interpret the solutions:\n   - The solutions to the quadratic equation are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes\n\n5. Sum the x-values:\n   - Add the two x-values found in step 3\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum makes sense given the original function\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the x-values for the vertical asymptotes\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculation and reasoning steps efficiently.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our progress so far, we have successfully calculated one of the roots of the quadratic equation. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We've confirmed that the discriminant is 9, which means we have two rational roots.\n2. We've calculated the first root using (7 + 3) / (2 * 1), which gave us 5.\n\nNow, we need to complete our solution by:\n\n1. Calculating the second root\n2. Verifying both roots\n3. Summing the roots to get our final answer\n\nFor the next step, we should calculate the second root using the quadratic formula. We already know that the formula is (7 - 3) / (2 * 1) for this root.\n\nAfter we calculate this, we'll have both x-values for the vertical asymptotes. We can then easily sum these values to get our final answer.\n\nTherefore, I recommend we proceed with calculating the second root using (7 - 3) / (2 * 1).\n",
