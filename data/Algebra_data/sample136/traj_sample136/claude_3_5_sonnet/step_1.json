    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the function:\n   - Analyze the given function: $y=\\frac{5}{x^2 - 7x + 10}$\n   - Recognize that this is a rational function\n\n2. Identify the conditions for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0$\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n   - Identify a, b, and c: a = 1, b = -7, c = 10\n   - Calculate the discriminant: $b^2 - 4ac$\n   - Solve for x\n\n4. Interpret the solutions:\n   - The solutions to the quadratic equation are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes\n\n5. Sum the x-values:\n   - Add the two x-values found in step 3\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum makes sense given the original function\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the x-values for the vertical asymptotes\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculation and reasoning steps efficiently.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical action and the result of the discriminant calculation, we now have a crucial piece of information to proceed with solving the quadratic equation. The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) has been calculated to be 9.\n\nThis positive discriminant tells us two important things:\n1. The quadratic equation has two real roots (since the discriminant is positive).\n2. These roots will be rational numbers (since 9 is a perfect square).\n\nNow that we have the discriminant, we can proceed with using the quadratic formula to find the exact values of x for the vertical asymptotes. \n\nThe quadratic formula is: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nWe know that:\na = 1\nb = -7\nc = 10\n\u221a(b^2 - 4ac) = \u221a9 = 3\n\nSo, our next step should be to substitute these values into the quadratic formula and solve for x. This will give us the two x-values for the vertical asymptotes, which we can then sum to get our final answer.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we use the calculator to compute:\n(7 + 3) / (2 * 1) for the first root, and\n(7 - 3) / (2 * 1) for the second root.\n",
