    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the function:\n   - Analyze the given function: $y=\\frac{5}{x^2 - 7x + 10}$\n   - Recognize that this is a rational function\n\n2. Identify the conditions for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0$\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n   - Identify a, b, and c: a = 1, b = -7, c = 10\n   - Calculate the discriminant: $b^2 - 4ac$\n   - Solve for x\n\n4. Interpret the solutions:\n   - The solutions to the quadratic equation are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes\n\n5. Sum the x-values:\n   - Add the two x-values found in step 3\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum makes sense given the original function\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the x-values for the vertical asymptotes\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculation and reasoning steps efficiently.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the historical actions, we have successfully calculated both roots of the quadratic equation that represents the x-values of the vertical asymptotes.

We calculated the second root: (7 - 3) / (2 * 1) = 2\n\nThese roots, 5 and 2, are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes for the function $y=\\frac{5}{x^2 - 7x + 10}$.\n\nNow that we have both x-values, we can proceed to the final step of our problem: finding the sum of these x-values.\n\nThe next logical operation is to add these two values together:\n\n5 + 2\n\nThis sum will give us the final answer to our original problem: the sum of x-values for the vertical asymptotes of the given function.\n\nAfter calculating this sum, we should also verify that these values indeed make the denominator of our original function equal to zero, as a final check of our solution.\n",
