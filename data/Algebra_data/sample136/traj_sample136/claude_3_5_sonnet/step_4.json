    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the function:\n   - Analyze the given function: $y=\\frac{5}{x^2 - 7x + 10}$\n   - Recognize that this is a rational function\n\n2. Identify the conditions for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0$\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n   - Identify a, b, and c: a = 1, b = -7, c = 10\n   - Calculate the discriminant: $b^2 - 4ac$\n   - Solve for x\n\n4. Interpret the solutions:\n   - The solutions to the quadratic equation are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes\n\n5. Sum the x-values:\n   - Add the two x-values found in step 3\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum makes sense given the original function\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the x-values for the vertical asymptotes\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculation and reasoning steps efficiently.\n",

We identified that the vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of the function equals zero: x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\n2. We solved this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.\n3. We found two roots: x = 5 and x = 2\n4. We calculated the sum of these roots: 5 + 2 = 7\n\nThe sum 7 is our final answer to the original problem. \n\nTo verify our solution, we should check if these x-values (5 and 2) indeed make the denominator of our original function equal to zero:\n\nFor x = 5: 5^2 - 7(5) + 10 = 25 - 35 + 10 = 0\nFor x = 2: 2^2 - 7(2) + 10 = 4 - 14 + 10 = 0\n\nBoth equations equal zero, confirming that 5 and 2 are indeed the x-values of the vertical asymptotes.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently state that the sum of x-values for the vertical asymptotes of the function $y=\\frac{5}{x^2 - 7x + 10}$ is 7.\n\nNo further calculations or actions are needed.
