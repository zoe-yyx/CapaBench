Identify the conditions for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator equals zero\n   - Set up the equation: $x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0$\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n   - Identify a, b, and c: a = 1, b = -7, c = 10\n   - Calculate the discriminant: $b^2 - 4ac$\n   - Solve for x\n\n4. Interpret the solutions:\n   - The solutions to the quadratic equation are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes\n\n5. Sum the x-values:\n   - Add the two x-values found in step 3\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum makes sense given the original function\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the x-values for the vertical asymptotes\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculation and reasoning steps efficiently.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we are at the beginning of solving this problem, our first step should be to focus on identifying the conditions for vertical asymptotes. \n\nWe know that vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function equals zero. In this case, we need to set up the equation:\n\nx^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation that we need to solve to find the x-values of the vertical asymptotes. To solve this, we'll use the quadratic formula. \n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients in the standard form of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c).\n\nIn our equation:\na = 1\nb = -7\nc = 10\n\nThe next logical step would be to calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) and then use the quadratic formula to solve for x. This will give us the x-values of the vertical asymptotes, which we can then sum to get our final answer.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we proceed with calculating the discriminant as our next operation.\n",
