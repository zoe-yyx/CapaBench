    "observation": "A class plans a series of debates, where every student must debate with every other student exactly once. If there are 15 debates in total, how many students are in the class?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Debate Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Each student debates every other student once\n   - Total number of debates: 15\n   - Unknown: Number of students in the class\n\n2. Recognize the problem type:\n   - This is a combination problem involving handshakes or pairings\n\n3. Determine the mathematical approach:\n   - Use the combination formula for pairs: nC2 = n(n-1)/2\n   - Where n is the number of students and nC2 is the number of debates\n\n4. Set up the equation:\n   - n(n-1)/2 = 15\n\n5. Solve the equation:\n   - Multiply both sides by 2: n(n-1) = 30\n   - Expand: n^2 - n - 30 = 0\n   - This is a quadratic equation\n\n6. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring method\n   - Consider only the positive integer solution\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the number of students found satisfies the original condition\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the number of students in the class\n\n9. Reflect on the problem-solving process:\n   - Discuss the efficiency of the method used\n   - Consider alternative approaches, if any\n\n10. Conclude the solution:\n    - Summarize the problem, method, and answer\n",
