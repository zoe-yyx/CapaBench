    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Debate Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Each student debates every other student once\n   - Total number of debates: 15\n   - Unknown: Number of students in the class\n\n2. Recognize the problem type:\n   - This is a combination problem involving handshakes or pairings\n\n3. Determine the mathematical approach:\n   - Use the combination formula for pairs: nC2 = n(n-1)/2\n   - Where n is the number of students and nC2 is the number of debates\n\n4. Set up the equation:\n   - n(n-1)/2 = 15\n\n5. Solve the equation:\n   - Multiply both sides by 2: n(n-1) = 30\n   - Expand: n^2 - n - 30 = 0\n   - This is a quadratic equation\n\n6. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring method\n   - Consider only the positive integer solution\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the number of students found satisfies the original condition\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the number of students in the class\n\n9. Reflect on the problem-solving process:\n   - Discuss the efficiency of the method used\n   - Consider alternative approaches, if any\n\n10. Conclude the solution:\n    - Summarize the problem, method, and answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the equation using the combination formula for pairs. This formula is key to solving the problem as it relates the number of students to the number of debates.\n\nThe formula is: nC2 = n(n-1)/2\n\nWhere:\nn = number of students\nnC2 = number of debates (which we know is 15)\n\nSo, our equation is:\nn(n-1)/2 = 15\n\nThe next logical step would be to solve this equation. To do this, we need to:\n1. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction\n2. Expand the resulting equation\n3. Rearrange it into standard quadratic form\n\nAfter these steps, we'll have a quadratic equation that we can solve to find the number of students.\n\nI suggest the acting agent perform these algebraic manipulations step by step, showing each step clearly. This will set us up to solve the quadratic equation in the next phase.\n",
