    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Debate Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Each student debates every other student once\n   - Total number of debates: 15\n   - Unknown: Number of students in the class\n\n2. Recognize the problem type:\n   - This is a combination problem involving handshakes or pairings\n\n3. Determine the mathematical approach:\n   - Use the combination formula for pairs: nC2 = n(n-1)/2\n   - Where n is the number of students and nC2 is the number of debates\n\n4. Set up the equation:\n   - n(n-1)/2 = 15\n\n5. Solve the equation:\n   - Multiply both sides by 2: n(n-1) = 30\n   - Expand: n^2 - n - 30 = 0\n   - This is a quadratic equation\n\n6. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring method\n   - Consider only the positive integer solution\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the number of students found satisfies the original condition\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the number of students in the class\n\n9. Reflect on the problem-solving process:\n   - Discuss the efficiency of the method used\n   - Consider alternative approaches, if any\n\n10. Conclude the solution:\n    - Summarize the problem, method, and answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have identified this as a combination problem and set up the equation n(n-1)/2 = 15, our next steps should focus on solving this equation to find the number of students.\n\n1. We need to multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   n(n-1) = 30\n\n2. This gives us a quadratic equation that needs to be solved:\n   n^2 - n - 30 = 0\n\n3. To solve this quadratic equation, we can use either the factoring method or the quadratic formula. Since the numbers are relatively small, factoring might be easier.\n\n4. We should look for two numbers that multiply to give -30 and add up to -1 (the coefficient of n).\n\n5. Once we find these factors, we can solve for n.\n\n6. After solving, we need to verify that our solution is a positive integer and satisfies the original condition.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with these steps, starting with expanding the equation n(n-1) = 30 and then moving on to solving the resulting quadratic equation.\n",
