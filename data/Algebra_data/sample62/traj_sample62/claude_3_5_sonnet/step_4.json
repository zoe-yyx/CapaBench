    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the expression under the fourth root:\n   - Recognize that we have 3 instances of 81^3 being added together\n   - Simplify this to 3 * 81^3\n\n2. Evaluate 81^3:\n   - Use a calculator to compute 81^3\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - This gives us the value under the fourth root\n\n4. Calculate the fourth root:\n   - Use a calculator or other method to find the fourth root of the result from step 3\n\n5. Round the final answer:\n   - Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Consider checking by raising the rounded result to the 4th power to see if it's close to the original expression\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculations and potentially a search engine for any needed formulas or methods.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress so far, we have successfully calculated the square root of 1,594,323, which is approximately 1262.66503871771. This is an important intermediate step in our solution process.\n\nNow, to complete our calculation of the fourth root of 1,594,323, we need to take the square root of this intermediate result.
