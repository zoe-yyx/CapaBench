    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the expression under the fourth root:\n   - Recognize that we have 3 instances of 81^3 being added together\n   - Simplify this to 3 * 81^3\n\n2. Evaluate 81^3:\n   - Use a calculator to compute 81^3\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - This gives us the value under the fourth root\n\n4. Calculate the fourth root:\n   - Use a calculator or other method to find the fourth root of the result from step 3\n\n5. Round the final answer:\n   - Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Consider checking by raising the rounded result to the 4th power to see if it's close to the original expression\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculations and potentially a search engine for any needed formulas or methods.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the result we've received, it appears that the calculator used by the acting agent was not able to properly evaluate the fourth root of 1,594,323. Instead, it returned the expression \"(1594323)^(1/4)\" without computing the actual numerical value.\n\nGiven this situation, we need to adjust our approach. We have two options:\n\n1. We can try to use a more advanced calculator or a specialized mathematical software that can handle fourth roots of large numbers.\n\n2. Alternatively, we can break down the problem further:\n   - We know that (1594323)^(1/4) is equivalent to \u2074\u221a1594323.\n   - This can be rewritten as \u00b2\u221a(\u00b2\u221a1594323).\n\nLet's opt for the second approach as it allows us to use simpler calculator functions that are more likely to be available.\n\nOur next step should be to calculate the square root of 1,594,323. This will give us an intermediate result that we can then use to calculate the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to compute the square root of 1,594,323. After this, we'll take another square root of the result to obtain our final answer.\n",
