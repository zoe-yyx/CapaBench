    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the expression under the fourth root:\n   - Recognize that we have 3 instances of 81^3 being added together\n   - Simplify this to 3 * 81^3\n\n2. Evaluate 81^3:\n   - Use a calculator to compute 81^3\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - This gives us the value under the fourth root\n\n4. Calculate the fourth root:\n   - Use a calculator or other method to find the fourth root of the result from step 3\n\n5. Round the final answer:\n   - Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Consider checking by raising the rounded result to the 4th power to see if it's close to the original expression\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculations and potentially a search engine for any needed formulas or methods.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have successfully calculated 81^3 = 531441, our next logical step is to multiply this result by 3, as per our simplified expression under the fourth root: 3 * 81^3.\n\nThis multiplication will give us the complete value under the fourth root. Once we have this value, we can proceed to calculate the fourth root itself.\n\nThe calculation 3 * 531441 is straightforward but involves large numbers, so it's best to use a calculator for accuracy. This step is crucial as it completes the simplification of the expression under the fourth root, setting us up for the main calculation of finding the fourth root.\n\nAfter this multiplication, we'll be ready to tackle the fourth root calculation, which will likely require a more specialized calculator function or a mathematical method for extracting roots.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 531441 by 3, giving us the final value under the fourth root.\n",
