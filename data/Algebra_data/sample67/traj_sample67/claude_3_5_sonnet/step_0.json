Identify the composition required:\n   - We need to find h(j(-2)), which means we first calculate j(-2) and then use that result as input for h(x).\n\n3. Calculate j(-2):\n   - Substitute -2 into j(x) = x^3 - 1\n   - j(-2) = (-2)^3 - 1\n\n4. Evaluate (-2)^3:\n   - Use the calculator to compute (-2)^3\n\n5. Complete the calculation of j(-2):\n   - Subtract 1 from the result of step 4\n\n6. Use the result from step 5 as input for h(x):\n   - Substitute the value of j(-2) into h(x) = 2x + 3\n\n7. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Multiply the value from step 5 by 2\n   - Add 3 to the result\n\n8. Verify the answer:\n   - Double-check all calculations\n   - Ensure the final result is a single numerical value\n\n9. Present the final answer:\n   - State h(j(-2)) = [final calculated value]\n\n10.
