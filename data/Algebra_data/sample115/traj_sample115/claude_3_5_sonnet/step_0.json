    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we're at the beginning of the problem-solving process, our first step should be to simplify the base of the logarithm. This involves evaluating $\\sqrt[4]{16}$.\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. $\\sqrt[4]{16}$ is equivalent to $(16)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n2. $16$ can be written as $2^4$\n3. So, we have $(2^4)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n4. Using the power rule of exponents, this simplifies to $2^{4 \\times \\frac{1}{4}} = 2^1 = 2$\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt[4]{16} = 2$\n\nThis simplification will make our logarithm easier to work with in the subsequent steps.
