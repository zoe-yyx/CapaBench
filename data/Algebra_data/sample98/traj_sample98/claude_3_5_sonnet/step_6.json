    "observation": "Emily and her brother Mark receive a total of $200 as a gift. Emily decides to save $50 and Mark decides to save twice as much as Emily. How much does Mark save?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Total gift amount: $200\n   - Emily's savings: $50\n   - Mark's savings: Twice as much as Emily\n\n2. Calculate Mark's savings:\n   - Use the information that Mark saves twice as much as Emily\n   - Multiply Emily's savings by 2\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated amount makes sense within the context of the total gift\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - State how much Mark saves\n\n5. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate how much money is left after both Emily and Mark save their portions\n   - Determine the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves\n\nThis plan should allow for a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection information and the original problem, we need to focus on providing the most precise and direct answer to the question \"How much does Mark save?\" without any additional symbols or units.\n\nOur previous calculations and reasoning were correct:\n1. We determined that Emily saves $50.\n2. We calculated that Mark saves twice as much as Emily: 50 * 2 = 100.\n\nThe flaw in our final answer was including the dollar sign, which was not explicitly required by the question.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning should guide the acting agent to restate the answer in its simplest form:\n\n1. Recall the calculated amount Mark saves: 100\n2. Present this number without any currency symbols or additional information\n\nThis approach ensures we directly answer the question as asked, avoiding any potential misinterpretation or unnecessary complexity. The acting agent should simply confirm the numerical value 100 as the final answer to \"How much does Mark save?\"\n",
