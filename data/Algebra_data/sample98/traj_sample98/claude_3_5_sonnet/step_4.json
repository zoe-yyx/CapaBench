    "observation": "Emily and her brother Mark receive a total of $200 as a gift. Emily decides to save $50 and Mark decides to save twice as much as Emily. How much does Mark save?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Total gift amount: $200\n   - Emily's savings: $50\n   - Mark's savings: Twice as much as Emily\n\n2. Calculate Mark's savings:\n   - Use the information that Mark saves twice as much as Emily\n   - Multiply Emily's savings by 2\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated amount makes sense within the context of the total gift\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - State how much Mark saves\n\n5. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate how much money is left after both Emily and Mark save their portions\n   - Determine the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves\n\nThis plan should allow for a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations performed so far, we have determined that Emily saves 25% of the total gift. Now, to complete our analysis, we should calculate the percentage of the total gift that Mark saves.\n\nWe know that:\n- The total gift amount is $200\n- Mark saved $100\n\nTo calculate the percentage Mark saves, we need to:\n1. Divide Mark's savings by the total gift amount: 100 / 200\n2. Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage\n\nThis calculation will give us the final piece of information needed to fully answer the original question and address all aspects of the optional extensions mentioned in the planning strategy.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have a complete breakdown of how the gift money was distributed:\n- The amount each sibling saved\n- The percentage of the total gift each sibling saved\n- The amount left unallocated\n\nThis comprehensive analysis will provide a clear and thorough solution to the problem.\n",
