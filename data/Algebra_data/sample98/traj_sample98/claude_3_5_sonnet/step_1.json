    "observation": "Emily and her brother Mark receive a total of $200 as a gift. Emily decides to save $50 and Mark decides to save twice as much as Emily. How much does Mark save?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Total gift amount: $200\n   - Emily's savings: $50\n   - Mark's savings: Twice as much as Emily\n\n2. Calculate Mark's savings:\n   - Use the information that Mark saves twice as much as Emily\n   - Multiply Emily's savings by 2\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated amount makes sense within the context of the total gift\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - State how much Mark saves\n\n5. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate how much money is left after both Emily and Mark save their portions\n   - Determine the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves\n\nThis plan should allow for a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe calculation performed by the acting agent confirms that Mark saves $100, which is twice as much as Emily's $50 savings. This directly answers the main question of the problem.\n\nTo verify the solution and provide a more comprehensive understanding, we should now consider the total amount saved by both Emily and Mark:\n\nEmily's savings: $50\nMark's savings: $100\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to calculate the total savings by adding these two amounts together. This will allow us to:\n\n1. Verify that the total savings don't exceed the original gift amount of $200.\n2. Determine how much of the gift remains unallocated, if any.\n3. Calculate the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves, as suggested in the optional extension of the planning strategy.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to add Emily's and Mark's savings together.\n",
