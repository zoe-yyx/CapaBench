    "observation": "Emily and her brother Mark receive a total of $200 as a gift. Emily decides to save $50 and Mark decides to save twice as much as Emily. How much does Mark save?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Total gift amount: $200\n   - Emily's savings: $50\n   - Mark's savings: Twice as much as Emily\n\n2. Calculate Mark's savings:\n   - Use the information that Mark saves twice as much as Emily\n   - Multiply Emily's savings by 2\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated amount makes sense within the context of the total gift\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - State how much Mark saves\n\n5. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate how much money is left after both Emily and Mark save their portions\n   - Determine the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves\n\nThis plan should allow for a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe acting agent has successfully calculated Mark's savings ($100) and the total amount saved by both Emily and Mark ($150). This information allows us to proceed with verifying the solution and exploring the optional extensions mentioned in the planning strategy.\n\nGiven:\n- Total gift amount: $200\n- Emily's savings: $50\n- Mark's savings: $100\n- Total savings: $150\n\nTo complete our analysis, we should:\n\n1. Calculate the amount left unallocated from the original gift:\n   $200 (total gift) - $150 (total savings) = amount left\n\n2. Calculate the percentage of the total gift that Emily saves:\n   ($50 / $200) * 100 = Emily's savings percentage\n\n3. Calculate the percentage of the total gift that Mark saves:\n   ($100 / $200) * 100 = Mark's savings percentage\n\nThese calculations will provide a comprehensive overview of how the gift money is distributed and saved, fulfilling all aspects of the original problem and the optional extensions.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these operations in sequence.\n",
