    "observation": "Emily and her brother Mark receive a total of $200 as a gift. Emily decides to save $50 and Mark decides to save twice as much as Emily. How much does Mark save?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Total gift amount: $200\n   - Emily's savings: $50\n   - Mark's savings: Twice as much as Emily\n\n2. Calculate Mark's savings:\n   - Use the information that Mark saves twice as much as Emily\n   - Multiply Emily's savings by 2\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated amount makes sense within the context of the total gift\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - State how much Mark saves\n\n5. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate how much money is left after both Emily and Mark save their portions\n   - Determine the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves\n\nThis plan should allow for a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations performed so far, we have a comprehensive understanding of the problem. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. Mark's savings: $100 (calculated earlier)\n2. Total savings by Emily and Mark: $150\n3. Amount left unallocated: $50\n\nNow, to complete our analysis and fulfill the optional extensions mentioned in the planning strategy, we need to calculate the percentages of the total gift that Emily and Mark save respectively.\n\nFor Emily:\n- Emily saved $50 out of the total $200 gift.\n- We need to calculate: ($50 / $200) * 100\n\nFor Mark:\n- Mark saved $100 out of the total $200 gift.\n- We need to calculate: ($100 / $200) * 100\n\nThese calculations will give us the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves, providing a complete picture of the gift distribution and savings.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these percentage calculations. First, let's start with Emily's savings percentage.\n",
