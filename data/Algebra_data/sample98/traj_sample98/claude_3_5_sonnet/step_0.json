    "observation": "Emily and her brother Mark receive a total of $200 as a gift. Emily decides to save $50 and Mark decides to save twice as much as Emily. How much does Mark save?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Total gift amount: $200\n   - Emily's savings: $50\n   - Mark's savings: Twice as much as Emily\n\n2. Calculate Mark's savings:\n   - Use the information that Mark saves twice as much as Emily\n   - Multiply Emily's savings by 2\n\n3. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated amount makes sense within the context of the total gift\n\n4. Present the final answer:\n   - State how much Mark saves\n\n5. Optional extension:\n   - Calculate how much money is left after both Emily and Mark save their portions\n   - Determine the percentage of the total gift that each sibling saves\n\nThis plan should allow for a straightforward solution within 2-3 rounds, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given information, we should focus on calculating Mark's savings. We know that Emily saved $50, and Mark decided to save twice as much as Emily. Therefore, our reasoning should guide the acting agent to perform the following calculation:\n\nMark's savings = Emily's savings \u00d7 2\n\nThis simple multiplication will give us the amount Mark saves. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this operation accurately. \n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have the answer to the main question of the problem. As an extension, we could then guide the acting agent to verify if the total savings of both Emily and Mark make sense within the context of the $200 total gift amount.\n",
