Simplify the resulting expression:\n   - Multiply out the terms in the numerator and denominator\n   - Combine like terms\n   - Cancel out common factors if possible\n\n4. Express the result in the form C\u221a4\u221aA / B:\n   - Identify the values of A, B, and C in the simplified expression\n\n5. Calculate A + B + C:\n   - Add the values of A, B, and C obtained in step 4\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the final expression is in its simplest form\n   - Ensure that A, B, and C are integers\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit.
