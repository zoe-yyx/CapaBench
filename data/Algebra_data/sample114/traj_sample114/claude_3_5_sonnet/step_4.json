Simplify each expression:\n   a) Simplify the numerator and denominator separately\n   b) Use laws of exponents to simplify further\n   c) Combine the simplified numerator and denominator\n\n2. For each expression:\n   a) Rewrite 16 as 2^4, 32 as 2^5, 64 as 2^6, and 128 as 2^7\n   b) Apply the negative exponent rule: a^(-n) = 1/a^n\n   c) Use the properties of exponents to combine terms\n\n3. After simplification, compare the results:\n   a) Look for expressions that reduce to the same value\n   b) Count the number of unique values\n\n4. Verify calculations:\n   a) Use a calculator to compute the decimal approximations of each simplified expression\n   b) Compare the decimal values to confirm uniqueness\n\n5. Final answer:\n   State the number of unique values represented by the given expressions\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved within 5-6 rounds, as the main steps involve simplification and comparison of the expressions.\n",
