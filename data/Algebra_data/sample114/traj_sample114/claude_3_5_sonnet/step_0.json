Simplify each expression:\n   a) Simplify the numerator and denominator separately\n   b) Use laws of exponents to simplify further\n   c) Combine the simplified numerator and denominator\n\n2. For each expression:\n   a) Rewrite 16 as 2^4, 32 as 2^5, 64 as 2^6, and 128 as 2^7\n   b) Apply the negative exponent rule: a^(-n) = 1/a^n\n   c) Use the properties of exponents to combine terms\n\n3. After simplification, compare the results:\n   a) Look for expressions that reduce to the same value\n   b) Count the number of unique values\n\n4. Verify calculations:\n   a) Use a calculator to compute the decimal approximations of each simplified expression\n   b) Compare the decimal values to confirm uniqueness\n\n5. Final answer:\n   State the number of unique values represented by the given expressions\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved within 5-6 rounds, as the main steps involve simplification and comparison of the expressions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we should start by simplifying each expression individually. Let's focus on the first expression: $$\\frac{16^{-3/4}}{2^{-1}}$$\n\nWe can reason through this as follows:\n\n1. Rewrite 16 as 2^4: $$\\frac{(2^4)^{-3/4}}{2^{-1}}$$\n\n2. Apply the power rule of exponents (a^b)^c = a^(bc):\n   $$(2^4)^{-3/4} = 2^{4 * (-3/4)} = 2^{-3}$$\n\n3. So our expression becomes: $$\\frac{2^{-3}}{2^{-1}}$$\n\n4. When dividing with the same base, we subtract the exponents:\n   $$2^{-3-(-1)} = 2^{-2}$$\n\n5. Finally, we can simplify this:\n   $$2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nTherefore, the first expression simplifies to 1/4.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to verify this result and then proceed to simplify the second expression using a similar process.\n",
