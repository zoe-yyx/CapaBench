    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify each expression:\n   a) Simplify the numerator and denominator separately\n   b) Use laws of exponents to simplify further\n   c) Combine the simplified numerator and denominator\n\n2. For each expression:\n   a) Rewrite 16 as 2^4, 32 as 2^5, 64 as 2^6, and 128 as 2^7\n   b) Apply the negative exponent rule: a^(-n) = 1/a^n\n   c) Use the properties of exponents to combine terms\n\n3. After simplification, compare the results:\n   a) Look for expressions that reduce to the same value\n   b) Count the number of unique values\n\n4. Verify calculations:\n   a) Use a calculator to compute the decimal approximations of each simplified expression\n   b) Compare the decimal values to confirm uniqueness\n\n5. Final answer:\n   State the number of unique values represented by the given expressions\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved within 5-6 rounds, as the main steps involve simplification and comparison of the expressions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the verified results of the first three expressions, let's proceed to simplify the fourth and final expression: $$\\frac{128^{-7/7}}{16^{-1}}$$\n\nWe can reason through this as follows:\n\n1. Rewrite 128 as 2^7 and 16 as 2^4: $$\\frac{(2^7)^{-7/7}}{(2^4)^{-1}}$$\n\n2. Apply the power rule of exponents (a^b)^c = a^(bc):\n   $(2^7)^{-7/7} = 2^{7 * (-7/7)} = 2^{-7}$\n   $(2^4)^{-1} = 2^{4 * (-1)} = 2^{-4}$\n\n3. Our expression becomes: $$\\frac{2^{-7}}{2^{-4}}$$\n\n4. When dividing with the same base, we subtract the exponents:\n   $$2^{-7-(-4)} = 2^{-3}$$\n\n5. Finally, we can simplify this:\n   $$2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{2^3} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n\nTherefore, the fourth expression should simplify to 1/8.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to verify this result. After this verification, we will have simplified all four expressions and can proceed to compare them to determine how many unique values they represent.\n\nFrom our simplifications so far, we have:\n1. First expression: 1/4\n2. Second expression: 1/8\n3. Third expression: 1\n4. Fourth expression: 1/8 (to be verified)\n\nOnce the fourth expression is verified, we can count the number of unique values among these results.\n",
