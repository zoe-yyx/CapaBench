    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Parabola Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Parabola equation: y = ax^2 + bx + c\n   - Three points: (1, 8), (2, 13), (3, 20)\n   - Goal: Find a + b + c\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Substitute each point into the parabola equation\n   - Create three equations with three unknowns (a, b, c)\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Use substitution or elimination method to find a, b, and c\n   - If needed, use a calculator for complex calculations\n\n4. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Once a, b, and c are found, add them together\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation\n   - Check if they satisfy all three given points\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Report the value of a + b + c\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on efficient equation solving and careful calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe mathematical reasoning and calculations performed were correct, leading to the accurate result of 8 for a + b + c. However, the issue arose in the presentation of the final answer. To rectify this:\n\n1. We need to restate the final answer, providing only the numerical value without any additional text or equation.\n\n2. The acting agent should be instructed to present the answer as simply \"8\" without any accompanying explanation or equation.\n\n3. To ensure accuracy, it would be prudent to quickly verify our calculations:\n   a = 1\n   b = 2\n   c = 5\n   1 + 2 + 5 = 8\n\n4. Once verified, the acting agent should be directed to submit the answer in the simplest form possible.\n\nThis approach should resolve the formatting issue while maintaining the correct mathematical solution.\n",
