    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we are now at the stage of setting up and solving the system of equations. Let's reason through this process:\n\n1. We have three points: (1, 8), (2, 13), and (3, 20).\n\n2. We need to substitute these points into the general equation y = ax^2 + bx + c:\n   For (1, 8):  8 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c, which simplifies to 8 = a + b + c\n   For (2, 13): 13 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c, which simplifies to 13 = 4a + 2b + c\n   For (3, 20): 20 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c, which simplifies to 20 = 9a + 3b + c\n\n3. Now we have a system of three equations:\n   8 = a + b + c\n   13 = 4a + 2b + c\n   20 = 9a + 3b + c\n\n4. To solve this system, we can use elimination. Let's start by subtracting the first equation from the second and third:\n   13 - 8 = (4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c)\n   5 = 3a + b\n   \n   20 - 8 = (9a + 3b + c) - (a + b + c)\n   12 = 8a + 2b\n\n5. Now we have two equations with two unknowns:\n   5 = 3a + b\n   12 = 8a + 2b\n\nThe next step would be to solve these two equations to find the values of a and b, and then use one of the original equations to find c.\n",
