    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Parabola Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Parabola equation: y = ax^2 + bx + c\n   - Three points: (1, 8), (2, 13), (3, 20)\n   - Goal: Find a + b + c\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Substitute each point into the parabola equation\n   - Create three equations with three unknowns (a, b, c)\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Use substitution or elimination method to find a, b, and c\n   - If needed, use a calculator for complex calculations\n\n4. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Once a, b, and c are found, add them together\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation\n   - Check if they satisfy all three given points\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Report the value of a + b + c\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on efficient equation solving and careful calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the initial action, we should now set up the system of equations using the three given points. This will allow us to solve for a, b, and c. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Let's substitute each point into the general equation y = ax^2 + bx + c:\n   For (1, 8):  8 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c  \u2192  8 = a + b + c\n   For (2, 13): 13 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c  \u2192  13 = 4a + 2b + c\n   For (3, 20): 20 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c  \u2192  20 = 9a + 3b + c\n\n2. Now we have a system of three equations:\n   Equation 1: 8 = a + b + c\n   Equation 2: 13 = 4a + 2b + c\n   Equation 3: 20 = 9a + 3b + c\n\n3. To solve this system, we can start by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n   (13 - 8) = (4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c)\n   5 = 3a + b\n\n4. Then, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:\n   (20 - 8) = (9a + 3b + c) - (a + b + c)\n   12 = 8a + 2b\n\nThese steps set up the groundwork for solving the system of equations. The acting agent should now be guided to perform these calculations and set up the simplified system of equations for further solving.\n",
