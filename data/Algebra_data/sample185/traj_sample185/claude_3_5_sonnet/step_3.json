    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Parabola Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Parabola equation: y = ax^2 + bx + c\n   - Three points: (1, 8), (2, 13), (3, 20)\n   - Goal: Find a + b + c\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Substitute each point into the parabola equation\n   - Create three equations with three unknowns (a, b, c)\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Use substitution or elimination method to find a, b, and c\n   - If needed, use a calculator for complex calculations\n\n4. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Once a, b, and c are found, add them together\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation\n   - Check if they satisfy all three given points\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Report the value of a + b + c\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on efficient equation solving and careful calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We have two equations:\n   5 = 3a + b\n   12 = 8a + 2b\n\n2. The last calculation (5 * 2 - 12 = -2) was likely an attempt to eliminate one variable. Let's use this approach more systematically:\n\n3. Multiply the first equation by 2:\n   10 = 6a + 2b\n\n4. Subtract this from the second equation:\n   12 - 10 = (8a + 2b) - (6a + 2b)\n   2 = 2a\n\n5. From this, we can deduce that a = 1\n\n6. Now that we know a, we can substitute it back into one of our original equations:\n   5 = 3(1) + b\n   5 = 3 + b\n   b = 2\n\n7. Now that we have a and b, we can use one of the original three equations to find c:\n   8 = a + b + c\n   8 = 1 + 2 + c\n   c = 5\n\n8. We have now found all three values:\n   a = 1\n   b = 2\n   c = 5\n\n9. The final step is to add these values to get a + b + c:\n   1 + 2 + 5 = 8\n\nTherefore, the value of a + b + c is 8.\n",
    "reflection": "Here is my reflection on why the acting agent confirmed a wrong answer:\n\n```\nFlaw: The acting agent's calculation process was correct, but they made the mistake of explicitly stating \"a + b + c =\" in the final answer instead of just providing the numerical value.\n\nImprovement: The acting agent should be instructed to provide only the numerical value as the final answer, without restating the equation or variables, to avoid potential formatting errors in the answer submission.\n```\n\nThe reasoning and calculation steps were accurate, leading to the correct numerical result of 8. However, the way the final answer was formatted likely caused it to be marked as incorrect. \n\nFor future problems, the acting agent should be advised to:\n1. Double-check the problem statement for any specific answer format requirements.\n2. When no specific format is mentioned, provide only the pure numerical value as the answer.\n3. Avoid restating the equation or variables in the final answer unless explicitly asked to do so.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the acting agent can improve the accuracy of answer submissions while maintaining the correct mathematical reasoning.",
