    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Parabola Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Parabola equation: y = ax^2 + bx + c\n   - Three points: (1, 8), (2, 13), (3, 20)\n   - Goal: Find a + b + c\n\n2. Set up a system of equations:\n   - Substitute each point into the parabola equation\n   - Create three equations with three unknowns (a, b, c)\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Use substitution or elimination method to find a, b, and c\n   - If needed, use a calculator for complex calculations\n\n4. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Once a, b, and c are found, add them together\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation\n   - Check if they satisfy all three given points\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Report the value of a + b + c\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on efficient equation solving and careful calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, our first step is to set up a system of equations using the given points and the general form of the parabola equation. Let's guide the acting agent to create these equations:\n\n1. For the point (1, 8):\n   8 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c\n   8 = a + b + c\n\n2. For the point (2, 13):\n   13 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c\n   13 = 4a + 2b + c\n\n3. For the point (3, 20):\n   20 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c\n   20 = 9a + 3b + c\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three unknowns:\n\nEquation 1: a + b + c = 8\nEquation 2: 4a + 2b + c = 13\nEquation 3: 9a + 3b + c = 20\n\nThe next step would be to solve this system of equations. We can start by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate c, and then proceed with the elimination method.\n",
