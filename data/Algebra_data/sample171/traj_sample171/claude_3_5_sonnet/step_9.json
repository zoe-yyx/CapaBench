    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the range of x values that satisfy the inequality: 2|x - 3| - |x + 2| > 0\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 < 0\n   - Case 3: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 < 0\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting inequality\n   - Determine the x-values that satisfy each case's conditions and the main inequality\n\n4. Combine results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases that satisfy the original inequality\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check the endpoints of the intervals to ensure they satisfy the original inequality\n   - Test a few points within the intervals to confirm the solution\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the solution in interval notation\n\n7. Reflect on the process:\n   - Discuss any challenges encountered and how they were overcome\n   - Consider if there are any alternative methods to solve this problem\n\nThis plan should guide the team through solving the inequality step by step, leading to the correct range of x values that satisfy the given condition.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our revised analysis and the latest calculations, let's reason through the final steps:\n\n1. We've determined that the inequality 2|x - 3| - |x + 2| > 0 is satisfied when x < 4/3 or x > 8.\n\n2. We've verified three key points:\n   a) x = 0: 2|0 - 3| - |0 + 2| = 4 > 0 (satisfies the inequality)\n   b) x = 5: 2|5 - 3| - |5 + 2| = -3 < 0 (does not satisfy the inequality)\n   c) We still need to check x = 10\n\n3. The result for x = 5 confirms that the interval between 4/3 and 8 is not part of the solution.\n\n4. To complete our verification, we need to check x = 10, which should satisfy the inequality based on our analysis.\n\n5. After this final check, we can confidently express our solution in interval notation.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to evaluate the original inequality for x = 10:\n\nCalculate 2|10 - 3| - |10 + 2|\n\nThis final calculation will provide complete confirmation of our solution, allowing us to express the range of values for x that satisfy the inequality in interval notation.\n",
