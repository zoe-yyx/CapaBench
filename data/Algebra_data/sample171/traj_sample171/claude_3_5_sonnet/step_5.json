    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the range of x values that satisfy the inequality: 2|x - 3| - |x + 2| > 0\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 < 0\n   - Case 3: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 < 0\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting inequality\n   - Determine the x-values that satisfy each case's conditions and the main inequality\n\n4. Combine results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases that satisfy the original inequality\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check the endpoints of the intervals to ensure they satisfy the original inequality\n   - Test a few points within the intervals to confirm the solution\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the solution in interval notation\n\n7. Reflect on the process:\n   - Discuss any challenges encountered and how they were overcome\n   - Consider if there are any alternative methods to solve this problem\n\nThis plan should guide the team through solving the inequality step by step, leading to the correct range of x values that satisfy the given condition.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the results we've obtained so far and the verification process we're conducting, let's analyze the latest calculation:\n\nFor x = 9 (representing the interval x > 8):\n2|9 - 3| - |9 + 2| = 2|6| - |11| = 12 - 11 = 1 > 0\n\nThis confirms that x = 9 satisfies the original inequality, supporting our solution for the interval x > 8.\n\nNow, we need to complete our verification by checking the point x = 0, which lies between -2 and 8. This will help us confirm that this middle region is indeed not part of our solution.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n2|(0) - 3| - |(0) + 2|\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have verified all key points of our solution:\n1. x < -2 (verified with x = -3)\n2. x > 8 (verified with x = 9)\n3. The region between -2 and 8 (to be verified with x = 0)\n\nOnce we have this final piece of information, we can confidently express our solution in interval notation, completing the problem-solving process.\n",
