    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the range of x values that satisfy the inequality: 2|x - 3| - |x + 2| > 0\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 < 0\n   - Case 3: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 < 0\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting inequality\n   - Determine the x-values that satisfy each case's conditions and the main inequality\n\n4. Combine results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases that satisfy the original inequality\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check the endpoints of the intervals to ensure they satisfy the original inequality\n   - Test a few points within the intervals to confirm the solution\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the solution in interval notation\n\n7. Reflect on the process:\n   - Discuss any challenges encountered and how they were overcome\n   - Consider if there are any alternative methods to solve this problem\n\nThis plan should guide the team through solving the inequality step by step, leading to the correct range of x values that satisfy the given condition.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the results from the previous calculations and our progress so far, let's reason through the next steps:\n\n1. We've solved Case 1, which gave us the solution x > 8.\n2. We've determined that Case 2 has no solution due to contradictory conditions.\n3. We're now working on Case 3, where x < 3 and x \u2265 -2.\n\nFor Case 3, we've simplified the inequality to:\n4 - 3x > 0\n\nNow we need to solve this inequality:\n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides:\n   -3x > -4\n\n2. Divide both sides by -3 (remember to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number):\n   x < 4/3\n\n3. Combining this with the conditions for Case 3 (x < 3 and x \u2265 -2):\n   We get: -2 \u2264 x < 4/3\n\nThis gives us another interval for our solution.\n\nNext, we should move on to Case 4, where:\nx - 3 < 0 and x + 2 < 0\n\nSimplifying these conditions:\nx < 3 and x < -2\n\nSince x < -2 is more restrictive than x < 3, we can focus on x < -2 for this case.\n\nFor Case 4, we need to remove the absolute value signs accordingly and solve the resulting inequality:\n\n2(-x + 3) - (-x - 2) > 0\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to simplify and solve this inequality. This will give us the final piece of our solution.\n",
