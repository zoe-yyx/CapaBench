    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find the range of x values that satisfy the inequality: 2|x - 3| - |x + 2| > 0\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x - 3 \u2265 0 and x + 2 < 0\n   - Case 3: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x - 3 < 0 and x + 2 < 0\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting inequality\n   - Determine the x-values that satisfy each case's conditions and the main inequality\n\n4. Combine results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases that satisfy the original inequality\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check the endpoints of the intervals to ensure they satisfy the original inequality\n   - Test a few points within the intervals to confirm the solution\n\n6. Express the final answer:\n   - Write the solution in interval notation\n\n7. Reflect on the process:\n   - Discuss any challenges encountered and how they were overcome\n   - Consider if there are any alternative methods to solve this problem\n\nThis plan should guide the team through solving the inequality step by step, leading to the correct range of x values that satisfy the given condition.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress so far and the results from the previous calculations, let's reason through the final steps:\n\n1. We've solved Cases 1, 2, and 3:\n   Case 1: x > 8\n   Case 2: No solution\n   Case 3: -2 \u2264 x < 4/3\n\n2. We're now working on Case 4, where x < -2.\n\nFor Case 4, we've simplified the inequality to:\n8 - x > 0\n\nLet's solve this inequality:\n\n1. Subtract 8 from both sides:\n   -x > -8\n\n2. Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to flip the inequality sign):\n   x < 8\n\n3. Combining this with the condition for Case 4 (x < -2):\n   We get: x < -2\n\nNow that we have solved all cases, we need to combine the results:\n\n1. From Case 1: x > 8\n2. From Case 3: -2 \u2264 x < 4/3\n3. From Case 4: x < -2\n\nCombining these intervals, we can see that the solution consists of two separate intervals:\n1. x < -2\n2. x > 8\n\nThe interval -2 \u2264 x < 4/3 from Case 3 is not part of the final solution because it doesn't satisfy the original inequality for all points in that interval.\n\nTo verify our solution, we should check a few points:\n1. A point less than -2 (e.g., -3)\n2. A point greater than 8 (e.g., 9)\n3. A point between -2 and 8 (e.g., 0) to confirm it's not in the solution\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to verify these points in the original inequality: 2|x - 3| - |x + 2| > 0\n",
