Identify the series:\n   - Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.\n   - First term (a1) = 4, Last term (an) = 100, Common difference (d) = 4.\n\n2. Determine the number of terms:\n   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for n (number of terms).\n\n3. Apply the sum formula for arithmetic sequences:\n   - Use the formula: Sn = (n/2)(a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of n terms.\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Substitute the values of n, a1, and an into the sum formula.\n   - Perform the final calculation to get the result.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation.\n   - Ensure the answer makes sense within the context of the problem.\n",

This is a crucial step that will allow us to use the sum formula for arithmetic sequences.\n\nTo find the number of terms (n), we'll use the arithmetic sequence formula:\nan = a1 + (n-1)d\n\nWhere:\nan (last term) = 100\na1 (first term) = 4\nd (common difference) = 4\n\nSubstituting these values:\n100 = 4 + (n-1)4\n\nWe need to solve this equation for n. This will require some algebraic manipulation and calculation. The acting agent should solve this equation to find the value of n.\n\nOnce we have n, we can proceed to use the sum formula for arithmetic sequences:\nSn = (n/2)(a1 + an)\n\nWhere:\nSn is the sum we're looking for\nn is the number of terms (which we'll calculate)\na1 = 4 (first term)\nan = 100 (last term)\n\nAfter finding n, we'll be able to plug all these values into the sum formula and calculate the final result.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on solving for n first, then use that value in the sum formula.\n",
