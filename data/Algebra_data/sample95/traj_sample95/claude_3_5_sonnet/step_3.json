Identify the series:\n   - Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.\n   - First term (a1) = 4, Last term (an) = 100, Common difference (d) = 4.\n\n2. Determine the number of terms:\n   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for n (number of terms).\n\n3. Apply the sum formula for arithmetic sequences:\n   - Use the formula: Sn = (n/2)(a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of n terms.\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Substitute the values of n, a1, and an into the sum formula.\n   - Perform the final calculation to get the result.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation.\n   - Ensure the answer makes sense within the context of the problem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the actions taken so far and the result we've obtained, let's reason about our next steps:\n\n1. Verification progress:\n   We've calculated the sum of the first five terms (4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20) and the last two terms (96 + 100), which gave us 256. This is a good start for verification, but it's not complete.\n\n2. Complete the verification:\n   To fully verify our result, we need to account for all 25 terms. We've covered 7 terms so far (5 from the beginning and 2 from the end). We need to add the sum of the remaining 18 terms to our partial sum of 256.\n\n3. Efficient verification method:\n   Instead of calculating each remaining term individually, we can use the properties of arithmetic sequences to our advantage. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms.\n\n4. Application of the verification method:\n   We know the first term (a1) is 4 and the last term (an) is 100. The average of these is (4 + 100) / 2 = 52. We have 25 terms in total. So, the sum should be 52 * 25 = 1300, which matches our original calculation.\n\n5. Final confirmation:\n   To solidify our verification, we should subtract our partial sum (256) from the total sum (1300) and confirm that the difference matches the sum of the middle 18 terms.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the acting agent should calculate the difference between our total sum and the partial sum we've already verified, to confirm that it equals the sum of the remaining terms.\n",
