Identify the series:\n   - Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.\n   - First term (a1) = 4, Last term (an) = 100, Common difference (d) = 4.\n\n2. Determine the number of terms:\n   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for n (number of terms).\n\n3. Apply the sum formula for arithmetic sequences:\n   - Use the formula: Sn = (n/2)(a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of n terms.\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Substitute the values of n, a1, and an into the sum formula.\n   - Perform the final calculation to get the result.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation.\n   - Ensure the answer makes sense within the context of the problem.\n",

Now that we have determined the number of terms (n) in the sequence, which is 25, we can proceed with calculating the sum using the formula for arithmetic sequences.\n\nLet's recall the sum formula for arithmetic sequences:\nSn = (n/2)(a1 + an)\n\nWe have all the necessary values:\nn = 25 (number of terms we just calculated)\na1 = 4 (first term of the sequence)\nan = 100 (last term of the sequence)\n\nNow, we need to substitute these values into the formula and perform the calculation. The acting agent should:\n\n1. Substitute the values into the formula:\n   Sn = (25/2)(4 + 100)\n\n2. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n   Sn = (25/2)(104)\n\n3. Multiply the terms:\n   Sn = 25 * 52\n\n4.
