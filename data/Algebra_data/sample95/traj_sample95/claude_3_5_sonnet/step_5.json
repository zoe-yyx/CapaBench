Identify the series:\n   - Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.\n   - First term (a1) = 4, Last term (an) = 100, Common difference (d) = 4.\n\n2. Determine the number of terms:\n   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for n (number of terms).\n\n3. Apply the sum formula for arithmetic sequences:\n   - Use the formula: Sn = (n/2)(a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of n terms.\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Substitute the values of n, a1, and an into the sum formula.\n   - Perform the final calculation to get the result.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation.\n   - Ensure the answer makes sense within the context of the problem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our comprehensive verification process, we can now confidently conclude that our original calculation of the sum of the series 4, 8, 12, ..., 100 is correct. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We initially calculated the sum using the arithmetic sequence formula, obtaining 1300.\n\n2. We verified this result through multiple steps:\n   a. We calculated the sum of the first 5 terms and last 2 terms (256).\n   b. We found the difference between 1300 and 256, which was 1044.\n   c. We confirmed that 1044 is indeed the sum of the middle 18 terms by using the arithmetic sequence properties.\n\n3. All our verifications align perfectly, providing strong evidence that 1300 is the correct sum.\n\nGiven this thorough verification, our next steps should focus on finalizing the solution and potentially exploring some additional insights:\n\n1. Formulate a clear, concise final answer to the original problem.\n2. Consider expressing the solution in terms of the arithmetic sequence properties we used.\n3. Reflect on the efficiency of the method we used and consider if there are any alternative approaches or shortcuts for similar problems.\n4. Think about how this problem and its solution might be applied in real-world scenarios or extended to more complex sequences.\n\nThe acting agent should now focus on crafting a clear, final statement of the solution, incorporating the key steps we used to arrive at and verify the answer.\n",
