Identify the series:\n   - Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.\n   - First term (a1) = 4, Last term (an) = 100, Common difference (d) = 4.\n\n2. Determine the number of terms:\n   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for n (number of terms).\n\n3. Apply the sum formula for arithmetic sequences:\n   - Use the formula: Sn = (n/2)(a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of n terms.\n\n4. Calculate the sum:\n   - Substitute the values of n, a1, and an into the sum formula.\n   - Perform the final calculation to get the result.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation.\n   - Ensure the answer makes sense within the context of the problem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have successfully calculated the sum of the arithmetic sequence, which is 1300, we should verify this result to ensure its accuracy. Here's the reasoning for our next steps:\n\n1. Verification through alternative method:\n   We can verify our result by calculating the sum manually for a few terms and comparing it with our formula-based result. This will help ensure our calculation is correct.\n\n2. Check if the result makes sense:\n   Given that we have 25 terms, and the sequence starts at 4 and ends at 100, we can do a quick estimation to see if 1300 is a reasonable sum.\n\n3. Explore the properties of the sequence:\n   Understanding some properties of this arithmetic sequence, such as the average of the first and last terms, can provide additional insight and confirmation of our result.\n\n4. Consider real-world context:\n   If this problem was part of a larger context or application, we might want to interpret what this sum means in that context.\n\nBased on these considerations, the acting agent should focus on verifying the result through an alternative method, such as calculating the sum of the first few terms and the last few terms to confirm our answer of 1300 is correct.\n",
