    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the equations:\n   a) For the first equation: $3^{3x} = 9^{x-3}$\n      - Recognize that 9 = 3^2\n   b) For the second equation: $27^{2y} = 81^{y+2}$\n      - Recognize that 27 = 3^3 and 81 = 3^4\n\n2. Rewrite both equations with the same base (3):\n   a) $3^{3x} = (3^2)^{x-3}$\n   b) $(3^3)^{2y} = (3^4)^{y+2}$\n\n3. Apply the laws of exponents to simplify further:\n   a) $3^{3x} = 3^{2(x-3)}$\n   b) $3^{6y} = 3^{4(y+2)}$\n\n4. Equate the exponents for each equation:\n   a) $3x = 2(x-3)$\n   b) $6y = 4(y+2)$\n\n5. Solve for x in the first equation:\n   a) Expand: $3x = 2x - 6$\n   b) Subtract 2x from both sides: $x = -6$\n   c) Verify the solution\n\n6. Solve for y in the second equation:\n   a) Expand: $6y = 4y + 8$\n   b) Subtract 4y from both sides: $2y = 8$\n   c) Divide both sides by 2: $y = 4$\n   d) Verify the solution\n\n7. Calculate the sum x + y:\n   Add the values of x and y found in steps 5 and 6\n\n8. Verify the final answer by substituting back into the original equations\n\n9. Present the final answer: x + y = ?\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider any alternative methods or shortcuts that could have been used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action taken, we should continue with simplifying the first equation using the laws of exponents. The next logical step is to apply the power rule to the right side of the equation.\n\nLet's focus on the right side: $(3^2)^{x-3}$\n\nUsing the power rule of exponents, we can simplify this to:\n\n$3^{2(x-3)}$\n\nThis step will allow us to have the same base (3) on both sides of the equation, which is crucial for solving exponential equations.\n\nAfter this simplification, we'll be ready to equate the exponents and solve for x in the first equation, as outlined in steps 3 and 4 of our planning strategy.\n",
