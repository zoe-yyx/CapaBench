    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the equations:\n   a) For the first equation: $3^{3x} = 9^{x-3}$\n      - Recognize that 9 = 3^2\n   b) For the second equation: $27^{2y} = 81^{y+2}$\n      - Recognize that 27 = 3^3 and 81 = 3^4\n\n2. Rewrite both equations with the same base (3):\n   a) $3^{3x} = (3^2)^{x-3}$\n   b) $(3^3)^{2y} = (3^4)^{y+2}$\n\n3. Apply the laws of exponents to simplify further:\n   a) $3^{3x} = 3^{2(x-3)}$\n   b) $3^{6y} = 3^{4(y+2)}$\n\n4. Equate the exponents for each equation:\n   a) $3x = 2(x-3)$\n   b) $6y = 4(y+2)$\n\n5. Solve for x in the first equation:\n   a) Expand: $3x = 2x - 6$\n   b) Subtract 2x from both sides: $x = -6$\n   c) Verify the solution\n\n6. Solve for y in the second equation:\n   a) Expand: $6y = 4y + 8$\n   b) Subtract 4y from both sides: $2y = 8$\n   c) Divide both sides by 2: $y = 4$\n   d) Verify the solution\n\n7. Calculate the sum x + y:\n   Add the values of x and y found in steps 5 and 6\n\n8. Verify the final answer by substituting back into the original equations\n\n9. Present the final answer: x + y = ?\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider any alternative methods or shortcuts that could have been used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have solved the equation 3x = 2(x-3) for x, we should:\n\n1. Complete the solution for x:\n   - We have 3x = 2x - 6\n   - Subtracting 2x from both sides: x = -6\n   - This gives us the value of x\n\n2. Verify this solution by substituting x = -6 back into the original equation 3^(3x) = 9^(x-3)\n\n3. Move on to the second equation 27^(2y) = 81^(y+2):\n   - Rewrite it as (3^3)^(2y) = (3^4)^(y+2)\n   - Simplify to 3^(6y) = 3^(4y+8)\n   - Equate the exponents: 6y = 4y + 8\n\n4. Solve the equation 6y = 4y + 8 for y:\n   - Subtract 4y from both sides: 2y = 8\n   - Divide both sides by 2: y = 4\n\n5. Verify the solution for y by substituting y = 4 back into the original equation 27^(2y) = 81^(y+2)\n\n6. Calculate the sum x + y using the values we found: x = -6 and y = 4\n\nThese steps will allow us to complete the solution and find the required sum x + y.\n",
