    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the equations:\n   a) For the first equation: $3^{3x} = 9^{x-3}$\n      - Recognize that 9 = 3^2\n   b) For the second equation: $27^{2y} = 81^{y+2}$\n      - Recognize that 27 = 3^3 and 81 = 3^4\n\n2. Rewrite both equations with the same base (3):\n   a) $3^{3x} = (3^2)^{x-3}$\n   b) $(3^3)^{2y} = (3^4)^{y+2}$\n\n3. Apply the laws of exponents to simplify further:\n   a) $3^{3x} = 3^{2(x-3)}$\n   b) $3^{6y} = 3^{4(y+2)}$\n\n4. Equate the exponents for each equation:\n   a) $3x = 2(x-3)$\n   b) $6y = 4(y+2)$\n\n5. Solve for x in the first equation:\n   a) Expand: $3x = 2x - 6$\n   b) Subtract 2x from both sides: $x = -6$\n   c) Verify the solution\n\n6. Solve for y in the second equation:\n   a) Expand: $6y = 4y + 8$\n   b) Subtract 4y from both sides: $2y = 8$\n   c) Divide both sides by 2: $y = 4$\n   d) Verify the solution\n\n7. Calculate the sum x + y:\n   Add the values of x and y found in steps 5 and 6\n\n8. Verify the final answer by substituting back into the original equations\n\n9. Present the final answer: x + y = ?\n\n10. Reflect on the problem-solving process and consider any alternative methods or shortcuts that could have been used.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we have successfully rewritten and simplified the first equation. The next logical step is to equate the exponents on both sides of this simplified equation. This will allow us to solve for x.\n\nLet's reason through this:\n\n1. We now have the equation $3^{3x} = 3^{2(x-3)}$\n\n2. When the bases are the same (in this case, base 3), the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true.\n\n3. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n   3x = 2(x-3)\n\nThis equation will allow us to solve for x. The acting agent should proceed to solve this linear equation by expanding the right side and then isolating x.\n\nAfter solving for x, we should move on to simplifying and solving the second equation for y, following a similar process.\n",
