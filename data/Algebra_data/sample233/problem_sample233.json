    "problem": "The quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ has a vertex at $(3, -2)$ and passes through the point $(1, 8)$. Find the value of $f(5)$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(3, -2)$, the equation can be written in the vertex form as $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 - 2$. Plugging in the point $(1, 8)$ into the vertex form gives $8 = a(1 - 3)^2 - 2$. Solving for $a$ gives $8 = 4a - 2$, so $a = \\frac{5}{2}$. Substituting $a$ back into the vertex form, the equation becomes $f(x) = \\frac{5}{2}(x - 3)^2 - 2$. To find $f(5)$, substitute $x = 5$: $f(5) = \\frac{5}{2}(5 - 3)^2 - 2 = \\frac{5}{2}(4) - 2 = 10 - 2 = \\boxed{8}$.",
