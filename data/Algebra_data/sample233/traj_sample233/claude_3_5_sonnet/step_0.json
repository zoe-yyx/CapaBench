Use vertex form of quadratic function:\n   f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex\n\n3. Substitute vertex coordinates:\n   f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 - 2\n\n4. Use the point (1, 8) to find the value of 'a':\n   8 = a(1 - 3)^2 - 2\n   Solve for 'a'\n\n5. Once 'a' is known, we have the complete function\n\n6. Calculate f(5) using the function:\n   f(5) = a(5 - 3)^2 - 2\n\n7. Verify the result\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for precise calculations when needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by using the vertex form of the quadratic function. We know the vertex is at (3, -2), so we can begin with:\n\nf(x) = a(x - 3)^2 - 2\n\nThe next critical step is to determine the value of 'a'. We can do this by using the given point (1, 8) that the function passes through. Let's set up the equation:\n\n8 = a(1 - 3)^2 - 2\n\nThis equation will allow us to solve for 'a'. Once we have 'a', we can fully define our quadratic function and then calculate f(5).\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to solve this equation for 'a'. They should:\n\n1. Calculate (1 - 3)^2, which is (-2)^2 = 4\n2. Substitute this into the equation: 8 = 4a - 2\n3. Solve for 'a': 10 = 4a, so a = 10/4 = 2.5\n\nAfter finding 'a', we'll be ready to define the complete function and calculate f(5).\n",
