Use vertex form of quadratic function:\n   f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex\n\n3. Substitute vertex coordinates:\n   f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 - 2\n\n4. Use the point (1, 8) to find the value of 'a':\n   8 = a(1 - 3)^2 - 2\n   Solve for 'a'\n\n5. Once 'a' is known, we have the complete function\n\n6. Calculate f(5) using the function:\n   f(5) = a(5 - 3)^2 - 2\n\n7.
