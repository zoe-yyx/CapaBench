    "planning_context": "\nTo determine the domain of the given rational function g(x) = (3x-7)/(x^2 - 4x + 3), we should follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Identify the general domain restrictions for rational functions:\n   - The denominator cannot equal zero.\n\n2. Set up an equation to find values of x that make the denominator zero:\n   x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation in step 2:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring method to find the roots.\n\n4. Determine the x-values that are excluded from the domain:\n   - These will be the solutions found in step 3.\n\n5. Consider the entire real number line and remove the excluded values:\n   - The domain will be all real numbers except the excluded values.\n\n6. Express the domain in interval notation:\n   - Use parentheses and the union symbol to write the final answer.\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct domain expression within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for any complex calculations if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the original problem, planning strategy, and the historical action provided, it appears that the acting agent has already determined and expressed the domain of the function in interval notation. However, we should verify if this answer is correct and provide reasoning for each step.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. The denominator of the function is x^2 - 4x + 3. We need to find where this equals zero.\n\n2. Factoring the denominator: x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3)\n\n3. The denominator equals zero when x = 1 or x = 3. These are the values that should be excluded from the domain.\n\n4. The domain should include all real numbers except 1 and 3.\n\n5. The interval notation (-\u221e, 1) \u222a (1, 3) \u222a (3, \u221e) correctly represents this domain:\n   - It includes all numbers less than 1\n   - All numbers between 1 and 3\n   - All numbers greater than 3\n   - The parentheses indicate that 1 and 3 are not included in the domain\n\nThe reasoning supports the answer provided in the historical action. The next step should be to confirm this result and ensure no mistakes were made in the process.\n",
