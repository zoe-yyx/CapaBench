    "planning_context": "\nTo determine the domain of the given rational function g(x) = (3x-7)/(x^2 - 4x + 3), we should follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Identify the general domain restrictions for rational functions:\n   - The denominator cannot equal zero.\n\n2. Set up an equation to find values of x that make the denominator zero:\n   x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation in step 2:\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring method to find the roots.\n\n4. Determine the x-values that are excluded from the domain:\n   - These will be the solutions found in step 3.\n\n5. Consider the entire real number line and remove the excluded values:\n   - The domain will be all real numbers except the excluded values.\n\n6. Express the domain in interval notation:\n   - Use parentheses and the union symbol to write the final answer.\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct domain expression within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for any complex calculations if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our planning strategy, we should start by focusing on the denominator of the given rational function. The key step is to find the values of x that make the denominator equal to zero, as these will be the excluded values from our domain.\n\nLet's begin by setting up the equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula or try to factor it. Given its form, factoring might be the quicker approach.\n\nWe're looking for two numbers that multiply to give 3 and add up to -4. These numbers are -1 and -3.\n\nSo, we can factor the denominator as:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThis means the denominator will be zero when x = 1 or x = 3.\n\nThese are the values that need to be excluded from our domain. Therefore, our domain will be all real numbers except for 1 and 3.\n\nIn the next step, we should express this in interval notation. The acting agent should write out this interval notation, being careful to use parentheses to indicate that 1 and 3 are not included in the domain.\n",
