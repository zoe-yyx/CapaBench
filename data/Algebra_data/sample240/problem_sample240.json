    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, factorize the denominator of the rational function: $$x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x-3)(x-1).$$ The domain of the rational function is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero. The denominator is zero at $x=3$ and $x=1$. Thus, the domain of $g(x)$ is $$x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, 1) \\cup (1, 3) \\cup (3, \\infty)}.$$",
