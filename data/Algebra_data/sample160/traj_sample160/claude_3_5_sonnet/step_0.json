    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that no actions have been taken yet, we should start by formulating the equations for both lines. Let's begin with the first line:\n\n1. For the first line:\n   - We know it passes through the point (-2, 7) and has a y-intercept of 3.\n   - We can use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   - To find the slope (m), we can use the point (-2, 7) and the y-intercept (0, 3):\n     m = (7 - 3) / (-2 - 0) = 4 / -2 = -2\n   \n   The equation of the first line will be:\n   y - 7 = -2(x - (-2))\n   Simplifying: y - 7 = -2x - 4\n                y = -2x + 3  (This confirms the y-intercept is indeed 3)\n\n2. For the second line:\n   - We know it passes through the points (3, -5) and (5, -8)\n   - We can calculate the slope using these two points:\n     m = (-8 - (-5)) / (5 - 3) = -3 / 2 = -1.5\n   \n   The equation of the second line will be:\n   y - (-5) = -1.5(x - 3)\n   Simplifying: y + 5 = -1.5x + 4.5\n                y = -1.5x - 0.5\n\nNow we have the equations for both lines in slope-intercept form:\nLine 1: y = -2x + 3\nLine 2: y = -1.5x - 0.5\n\nThe next step would be to set up a system of equations and solve for the intersection point.\n",
