    "planning_context": "\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Recall the definition of i: i is the imaginary unit where i^2 = -1.\n\n2. Expand z^4 using the binomial theorem or by multiplying (1+i) by itself 4 times.\n\n3. Simplify the expanded form by combining like terms and using the property i^2 = -1.\n\n4. Separate the real and imaginary parts of the result.\n\n5. Express the final answer in standard form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Remember that odd powers of i will contribute to the imaginary part, while even powers will contribute to the real part.\n- Be careful with signs when simplifying.\n- The acting agent may need to use a calculator for the arithmetic calculations.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",

Binomial expansion: We could use the binomial theorem to expand (1 + i)^4.\n\nFor this problem, the binomial expansion might be more efficient and less prone to errors. \n\nThe binomial theorem states that:\n(a + b)^n = C(n,0)a^n + C(n,1)a^(n-1)b + C(n,2)a^(n-2)b^2 + ... + C(n,n-1)ab^(n-1) + C(n,n)b^n\n\nWhere C(n,k) represents the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = i, and n = 4.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step would be to apply the binomial theorem to expand (1 + i)^4.\n",
