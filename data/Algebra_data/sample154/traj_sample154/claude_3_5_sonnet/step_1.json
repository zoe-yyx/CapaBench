    "planning_context": "\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Recall the definition of i: i is the imaginary unit where i^2 = -1.\n\n2. Expand z^4 using the binomial theorem or by multiplying (1+i) by itself 4 times.\n\n3. Simplify the expanded form by combining like terms and using the property i^2 = -1.\n\n4. Separate the real and imaginary parts of the result.\n\n5. Express the final answer in standard form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Remember that odd powers of i will contribute to the imaginary part, while even powers will contribute to the real part.\n- Be careful with signs when simplifying.\n- The acting agent may need to use a calculator for the arithmetic calculations.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the result from the previous action, we now have the expanded form of (1+i)^4:\n\ni^4 + 4i^3 + 6i^2 + 4i + 1\n\nTo proceed, we need to simplify this expression, focusing on the following points:\n\n1. Simplify i^4:\n   We know that i^2 = -1, so i^4 = (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\n\n2. Simplify i^3:\n   i^3 = i * i^2 = i * (-1) = -i\n\n3. Simplify i^2:\n   We already know i^2 = -1\n\nAfter these simplifications, we can regroup the real and imaginary parts. The next logical step is to substitute these simplifications into our expression and combine like terms.\n\nThe acting agent should replace the powers of i with their simplified forms and then collect real and imaginary parts separately.\n",
