    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given expression:\n   - We have a complex fraction with a sum in the numerator and a single fraction in the denominator.\n\n2. Simplify the numerator:\n   - Add the fractions in the numerator (2/3 + 4/3).\n   - These fractions have the same denominator, so we can directly add the numerators.\n\n3. Simplify the overall fraction:\n   - Once the numerator is simplified, we'll have a fraction divided by another fraction.\n   - To divide fractions, we multiply by the reciprocal.\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   - Multiply the numerators.\n   - Multiply the denominators.\n\n5. Simplify the resulting fraction:\n   - Check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors.\n   - If so, divide both by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n6. Express the final answer as a simplified fraction.\n\nThis plan should lead to the simplified fraction within the 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward arithmetic operations and simplification steps.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we're at the beginning of solving this problem, our first step should be to simplify the numerator of the complex fraction. \n\nThe numerator contains two fractions: 2/3 and 4/3. These fractions have the same denominator (3), which makes addition straightforward. We can add the numerators while keeping the common denominator.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning suggests that the next operation should be to add 2/3 and 4/3. This will simplify the numerator and prepare us for the next step in the simplification process.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this addition:\n\n2/3 + 4/3\n\nThis operation will give us a single fraction in the numerator, which will make the overall expression easier to work with in subsequent steps.\n",
