    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given expression:\n   - We have a complex fraction with a sum in the numerator and a single fraction in the denominator.\n\n2. Simplify the numerator:\n   - Add the fractions in the numerator (2/3 + 4/3).\n   - These fractions have the same denominator, so we can directly add the numerators.\n\n3. Simplify the overall fraction:\n   - Once the numerator is simplified, we'll have a fraction divided by another fraction.\n   - To divide fractions, we multiply by the reciprocal.\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   - Multiply the numerators.\n   - Multiply the denominators.\n\n5. Simplify the resulting fraction:\n   - Check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors.\n   - If so, divide both by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n6. Express the final answer as a simplified fraction.\n\nThis plan should lead to the simplified fraction within the 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward arithmetic operations and simplification steps.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous action and the result obtained, we can now proceed with the next step in our simplification process. The calculator result shows that 2/3 + 4/3 = 2.00000000000000, which is equivalent to 2/1 or simply 2 in fractional form.\n\nNow, our expression has been simplified to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{\\frac{6}{7}} \\]\n\nFollowing our planning strategy, the next logical step is to simplify this complex fraction. To do this, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator. When dividing by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.\n\nTherefore, our next operation should be to multiply 2 by 7/6 (the reciprocal of 6/7).\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this multiplication:\n\n2 * (7/6)\n\nThis operation will give us the final result of our simplification, which we can then express as a simplified fraction if necessary.\n",
