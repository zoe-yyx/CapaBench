    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, simplify the numerator and the denominator. In the first fraction, $5+6+7 = 18$ and $3+2+1 = 6$, so the fraction simplifies to $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$. For the second fraction, $12+9+6 = 27$ and $6+5+4 = 15$, which simplifies to $\\frac{27}{15}$. To divide the two fractions, multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction: $3 \\cdot \\frac{15}{27} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{15}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
