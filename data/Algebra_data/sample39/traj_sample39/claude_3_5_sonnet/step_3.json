    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the numerators and denominators:\n   - Calculate 5+6+7 in the first fraction's numerator\n   - Calculate 3+2+1 in the first fraction's denominator\n   - Calculate 12+9+6 in the second fraction's numerator\n   - Calculate 6+5+4 in the second fraction's denominator\n\n2. Rewrite the expression with simplified fractions:\n   - Express the problem as (simplified first fraction) \u00f7 (simplified second fraction)\n\n3. Convert the division of fractions to multiplication:\n   - Flip the second fraction (reciprocal) and change \u00f7 to \u00d7\n\n4. Multiply the numerators and denominators:\n   - Multiply the numerators\n   - Multiply the denominators\n\n5. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible:\n   - Check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors\n   - If so, divide both by the greatest common divisor (GCD)\n\n6. Express the final answer as a simplified fraction or decimal:\n   - If the fraction can be simplified further, do so\n   - If required, convert the final fraction to a decimal\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic arithmetic operations that can be performed with a calculator if needed.\n",
