    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving $(8^{x+2})^2 \\cdot 16^{2x-1} = 2^{36}$:\n\n1. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   a) Recall that 8 = 2^3 and 16 = 2^4\n   b) Rewrite the equation using base 2 for all terms\n\n2. Apply exponent rules:\n   a) Combine like bases (all in base 2)\n   b) Simplify exponents\n\n3. Equate the exponents:\n   a) After simplification, the equation should be in the form 2^(some expression) = 2^36\n   b) The exponents on both sides must be equal\n\n4. Solve the resulting linear equation:\n   a) Isolate x on one side of the equation\n   b) Perform necessary arithmetic operations\n\n5. Check the solution:\n   a) Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation\n   b) Verify that both sides are indeed equal\n\n6. Present the final answer for x\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the given 10 rounds, utilizing the calculator for any necessary calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the current state of the problem, we have simplified the left side of the equation and equated the exponents. The next logical step is to solve the resulting linear equation for x. Here's the reasoning for the next operation:\n\n1. We have the equation 2^(6x+12+8x-4) = 2^36\n2. Since the bases are the same (2), we can equate the exponents:\n   6x + 12 + 8x - 4 = 36\n3. Now we need to combine like terms and solve for x:\n   - Combine the terms with x: 6x + 8x = 14x\n   - Combine the constant terms: 12 - 4 = 8\n   - The equation becomes: 14x + 8 = 36\n\nThe next operation should be to solve this linear equation for x. This involves:\n1. Subtracting 8 from both sides\n2. Dividing both sides by 14\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these operations accurately.\n",
