    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving $(8^{x+2})^2 \\cdot 16^{2x-1} = 2^{36}$:\n\n1. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   a) Recall that 8 = 2^3 and 16 = 2^4\n   b) Rewrite the equation using base 2 for all terms\n\n2. Apply exponent rules:\n   a) Combine like bases (all in base 2)\n   b) Simplify exponents\n\n3. Equate the exponents:\n   a) After simplification, the equation should be in the form 2^(some expression) = 2^36\n   b) The exponents on both sides must be equal\n\n4. Solve the resulting linear equation:\n   a) Isolate x on one side of the equation\n   b) Perform necessary arithmetic operations\n\n5. Check the solution:\n   a) Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation\n   b) Verify that both sides are indeed equal\n\n6. Present the final answer for x\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the given 10 rounds, utilizing the calculator for any necessary calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our planning strategy, we should start by simplifying the left side of the equation. Let's guide the acting agent to rewrite the equation using base 2 for all terms.\n\nWe know that:\n8 = 2^3\n16 = 2^4\n\nSo, we need to rewrite (8^(x+2))^2 \u00b7 16^(2x-1) in terms of base 2.\n\nFor (8^(x+2))^2:\n- 8^(x+2) = (2^3)^(x+2)\n- Then we square this: ((2^3)^(x+2))^2\n\nFor 16^(2x-1):\n- 16^(2x-1) = (2^4)^(2x-1)\n\nThe next step should be to apply the exponent rules to simplify these expressions. This will involve multiplying exponents when a power is raised to another power, and using the product rule of exponents when multiplying terms with the same base.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these simplifications step by step, starting with rewriting the left side of the equation in base 2.\n",
