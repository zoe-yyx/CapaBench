Recall the distance formula: The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula:\n   d = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\n3. Identify the coordinates:\n   Point 1: (x1, y1) = (2, -3)\n   Point 2: (x2, y2) = (-3, 4)\n\n4. Apply the distance formula:\n   a. Calculate (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1)\n   b. Square these differences\n   c. Add the squared differences\n   d. Take the square root of the sum\n\n5. Perform calculations:\n   a. Use a calculator to compute the values inside the square root\n   b. Use a calculator to find the final square root value\n\n6. Round the result if necessary (depending on the required precision)\n\n7. Present the final answer as the distance between the two points\n",
