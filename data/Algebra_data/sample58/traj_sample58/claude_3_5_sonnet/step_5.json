    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem: We need to find the distance between two points on a Cartesian coordinate plane.\n\n2. Recall the distance formula: The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula:\n   d = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\n3. Identify the coordinates:\n   Point 1: (x1, y1) = (2, -3)\n   Point 2: (x2, y2) = (-3, 4)\n\n4. Apply the distance formula:\n   a. Calculate (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1)\n   b. Square these differences\n   c. Add the squared differences\n   d. Take the square root of the sum\n\n5. Perform calculations:\n   a. Use a calculator to compute the values inside the square root\n   b. Use a calculator to find the final square root value\n\n6. Round the result if necessary (depending on the required precision)\n\n7. Present the final answer as the distance between the two points\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the original problem, we need to revise our approach and provide the exact answer rather than a rounded approximation. Let's reason through the correct final steps:\n\n1. We have correctly calculated that (x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 = 74.\n\n2. The distance formula gives us d = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2].\n\n3. Therefore, the exact distance is \u221a74.\n\n4. This \u221a74 is the most precise form of the answer, as it represents the exact distance without any loss of accuracy due to rounding.\n\n5. In mathematical notation, we can express this as:\n   The distance between (2, -3) and (-3, 4) is \u221a74 units.\n\n6. If we need to provide additional context, we can mention that \u221a74 is approximately equal to 8.60232526704263 units, but this should be clearly labeled as an approximation.\n\nThe acting agent should present the final answer as \u221a74 units, emphasizing that this is the exact distance in its simplest form. No further calculations are necessary unless the problem explicitly asks for a decimal approximation.\n",
