    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem: We need to find the distance between two points on a Cartesian coordinate plane.\n\n2. Recall the distance formula: The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula:\n   d = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\n3. Identify the coordinates:\n   Point 1: (x1, y1) = (2, -3)\n   Point 2: (x2, y2) = (-3, 4)\n\n4. Apply the distance formula:\n   a. Calculate (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1)\n   b. Square these differences\n   c. Add the squared differences\n   d. Take the square root of the sum\n\n5. Perform calculations:\n   a. Use a calculator to compute the values inside the square root\n   b. Use a calculator to find the final square root value\n\n6. Round the result if necessary (depending on the required precision)\n\n7. Present the final answer as the distance between the two points\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations, we have successfully determined:\n\n(x2 - x1) = -5\n(y2 - y1) = 7\n\nNow, we need to continue applying the distance formula:\nd = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\nThe next steps are:\n\n1. Square both differences:\n   (-5)\u00b2 and 7\u00b2\n\n2. Add these squared values\n\n3. Take the square root of the sum\n\nLet's focus on squaring the differences first. We need to calculate:\n\n(-5)\u00b2 = 25\n7\u00b2 = 49\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to verify these calculations. Once confirmed, we'll be ready to add these squared values and proceed with taking the square root to find the final distance.\n",
