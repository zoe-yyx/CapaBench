    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem: We need to find the distance between two points on a Cartesian coordinate plane.\n\n2. Recall the distance formula: The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula:\n   d = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\n3. Identify the coordinates:\n   Point 1: (x1, y1) = (2, -3)\n   Point 2: (x2, y2) = (-3, 4)\n\n4. Apply the distance formula:\n   a. Calculate (x2 - x1) and (y2 - y1)\n   b. Square these differences\n   c. Add the squared differences\n   d. Take the square root of the sum\n\n5. Perform calculations:\n   a. Use a calculator to compute the values inside the square root\n   b. Use a calculator to find the final square root value\n\n6. Round the result if necessary (depending on the required precision)\n\n7. Present the final answer as the distance between the two points\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations and actions, we have successfully determined:\n\n(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 = 74\n\nNow, we are at the final step of the distance formula:\nd = \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]\n\nWe need to take the square root of 74 to find the distance between the two points.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute the square root of 74. This will give us the final answer for the distance between the points (2, -3) and (-3, 4) on the Cartesian coordinate plane.\n\nAfter calculating the square root, we should consider rounding the result to an appropriate number of decimal places, depending on the required precision for the problem. Typically, two or three decimal places would be sufficient for most practical applications.\n",
