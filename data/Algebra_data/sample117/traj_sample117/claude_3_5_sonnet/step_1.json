Identify the nested structure:\n   We need to evaluate h(k(h(1))), which means we should work from the innermost function outward.\n\n3. Solve step-by-step:\n   a) First, calculate h(1)\n   b) Then, use the result as input for k(x)\n   c) Finally, use that result as input for h(x)\n\n4. Detailed calculation steps:\n   a) Calculate h(1)\n   b) Calculate k(result from step a)\n   c) Calculate h(result from step b)\n\n5. Simplify and get the final answer\n\n6. Verify the result by plugging it back into the original equation\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit, as it breaks down the nested function into clear, sequential steps.\n",

Now we can move on to the next step in our nested function evaluation.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate k(h(1)), which is now equivalent to k(3) since we found that h(1) = 3.\n\nLet's focus on evaluating k(3):\n\n1. We know that k(x) = x - 3\n2. We need to substitute x with 3\n3. This will give us k(3) = 3 - 3\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute 3 - 3. This will give us the value of k(h(1)), which is the second step in our nested function evaluation.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be ready to move on to the final step of evaluating h(k(h(1))) in the subsequent round.\n",
