    "observation": "In a small village, there are four types of fruits available in a market: apples, bananas, cherries, and dates. If the number of apples is twice the number of bananas, equal to three times the number of cherries, and four more than the number of dates, how many apples are there if the total number of fruits is 132?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Fruit Count Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x be the number of apples\n   - Express other fruits in terms of x:\n     * Bananas: x/2\n     * Cherries: x/3\n     * Dates: x - 4\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   Total fruits = Apples + Bananas + Cherries + Dates\n   132 = x + x/2 + x/3 + (x - 4)\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   a) Simplify the equation by finding a common denominator\n   b) Multiply both sides by the common denominator to eliminate fractions\n   c) Solve for x (number of apples)\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   a) Calculate the number of each fruit using the found value of x\n   b) Sum up all fruits to ensure the total is 132\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   State the number of apples and optionally provide the count of other fruits\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for precise calculations in steps 3 and 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our current progress, we have simplified our equation and are ready to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 6, as suggested in step 3b of our plan. Let's analyze the result of this operation:\n\n6 * (132 = 17x/6 - 4)\n\nThis multiplication will give us:\n\n792 = 17x - 24\n\nNow that we have eliminated the fraction, we can proceed to solve for x. The next logical steps are:\n\n1. Add 24 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:\n   792 + 24 = 17x\n   816 = 17x\n\n2. Divide both sides by 17 to solve for x:\n   816 / 17 = x\n\nThis division operation will give us the value of x, which represents the number of apples. Once we have this value, we can proceed to step 4 of our plan to verify the solution.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations in the next step, specifically dividing 816 by 17 to find the value of x (the number of apples).\n",
