    "observation": "In a small village, there are four types of fruits available in a market: apples, bananas, cherries, and dates. If the number of apples is twice the number of bananas, equal to three times the number of cherries, and four more than the number of dates, how many apples are there if the total number of fruits is 132?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Fruit Count Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x be the number of apples\n   - Express other fruits in terms of x:\n     * Bananas: x/2\n     * Cherries: x/3\n     * Dates: x - 4\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   Total fruits = Apples + Bananas + Cherries + Dates\n   132 = x + x/2 + x/3 + (x - 4)\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   a) Simplify the equation by finding a common denominator\n   b) Multiply both sides by the common denominator to eliminate fractions\n   c) Solve for x (number of apples)\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   a) Calculate the number of each fruit using the found value of x\n   b) Sum up all fruits to ensure the total is 132\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   State the number of apples and optionally provide the count of other fruits\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for precise calculations in steps 3 and 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations and verification, we have successfully solved the problem and confirmed our solution. Let's summarize our findings:\n\n1. We found that the number of apples (x) is 48.\n2. We verified the counts of other fruits:\n   - Bananas: 24 (half the number of apples)\n   - Cherries: 16 (one-third the number of apples)\n   - Dates: 44 (4 less than the number of apples)\n3. We confirmed that the total sum of all fruits is indeed 132, which matches the original problem statement.\n\nNow that we have verified our solution, we can proceed to the final step of our plan: presenting the final answer. The acting agent should formulate a clear and concise answer stating the number of apples and optionally providing the count of other fruits.\n\nThe reasoning should guide the acting agent to present the solution in a structured manner, addressing the original question directly while also providing additional context if desired. This will complete our problem-solving process and fulfill all steps of our initial plan.\n",
