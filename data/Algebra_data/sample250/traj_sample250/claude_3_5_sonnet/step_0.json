    "observation": "In a small village, there are four types of fruits available in a market: apples, bananas, cherries, and dates. If the number of apples is twice the number of bananas, equal to three times the number of cherries, and four more than the number of dates, how many apples are there if the total number of fruits is 132?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Fruit Count Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x be the number of apples\n   - Express other fruits in terms of x:\n     * Bananas: x/2\n     * Cherries: x/3\n     * Dates: x - 4\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   Total fruits = Apples + Bananas + Cherries + Dates\n   132 = x + x/2 + x/3 + (x - 4)\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   a) Simplify the equation by finding a common denominator\n   b) Multiply both sides by the common denominator to eliminate fractions\n   c) Solve for x (number of apples)\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   a) Calculate the number of each fruit using the found value of x\n   b) Sum up all fruits to ensure the total is 132\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   State the number of apples and optionally provide the count of other fruits\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for precise calculations in steps 3 and 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to set up the equation as outlined in step 2 of the planning strategy. This equation will represent the relationship between all fruit types and the total number of fruits.\n\nLet's express this equation:\n\n132 = x + x/2 + x/3 + (x - 4)\n\nWhere x represents the number of apples.\n\nThis equation encapsulates all the given information:\n- The total number of fruits is 132\n- x is the number of apples\n- x/2 represents bananas (half the number of apples)\n- x/3 represents cherries (one-third the number of apples)\n- (x - 4) represents dates (4 less than the number of apples)\n\nThe next logical step would be to simplify this equation by finding a common denominator, as suggested in step 3a of the plan. This will prepare us for solving the equation to find the value of x.\n",
