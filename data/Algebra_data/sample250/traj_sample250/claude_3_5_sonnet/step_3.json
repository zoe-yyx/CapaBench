    "observation": "In a small village, there are four types of fruits available in a market: apples, bananas, cherries, and dates. If the number of apples is twice the number of bananas, equal to three times the number of cherries, and four more than the number of dates, how many apples are there if the total number of fruits is 132?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan to Solve the Fruit Count Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x be the number of apples\n   - Express other fruits in terms of x:\n     * Bananas: x/2\n     * Cherries: x/3\n     * Dates: x - 4\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   Total fruits = Apples + Bananas + Cherries + Dates\n   132 = x + x/2 + x/3 + (x - 4)\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   a) Simplify the equation by finding a common denominator\n   b) Multiply both sides by the common denominator to eliminate fractions\n   c) Solve for x (number of apples)\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   a) Calculate the number of each fruit using the found value of x\n   b) Sum up all fruits to ensure the total is 132\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   State the number of apples and optionally provide the count of other fruits\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for precise calculations in steps 3 and 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations, we have successfully solved for x:\n\n816 / 17 = 48\n\nThis means that the number of apples (x) is 48. Now that we have this value, we can proceed to step 4 of our plan: verifying the solution.\n\nTo verify, we need to calculate the number of each fruit using the value of x we found:\n\n1. Apples: x = 48\n2. Bananas: x/2 = 48/2 = 24\n3. Cherries: x/3 = 48/3 = 16\n4. Dates: x - 4 = 48 - 4 = 44\n\nThe next step is to sum up all these fruits to ensure the total is 132, as stated in the original problem. We should instruct the acting agent to use a calculator to add these numbers:\n\n48 + 24 + 16 + 44\n\nIf this sum equals 132, we have verified our solution and can proceed to step 5: presenting the final answer. If not, we would need to revisit our calculations.\n",
