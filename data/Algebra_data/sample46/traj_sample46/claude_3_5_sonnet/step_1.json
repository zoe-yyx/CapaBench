    "observation": "David and Sarah have 30 marbles together. David has twice as many marbles as Sarah. How many marbles does David have more than Sarah?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total marbles: 30\n   - David has twice as many marbles as Sarah\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   - Let x = Sarah's marbles\n   - Then 2x = David's marbles\n   - Total marbles equation: x + 2x = 30\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify: 3x = 30\n   - Divide both sides by 3 to find x (Sarah's marbles)\n\n4. Calculate David's marbles:\n   - David's marbles = 2x\n\n5. Find the difference:\n   - Subtract Sarah's marbles from David's marbles\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the total of Sarah's and David's marbles equals 30\n   - Confirm that David has twice as many as Sarah\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State how many more marbles David has than Sarah\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated that Sarah has 10 marbles (x = 10), we can proceed with the next steps in our problem-solving strategy:\n\n1. Calculate David's marbles:\n   - We know that David has twice as many marbles as Sarah\n   - David's marbles = 2x = 2 * 10\n\n2. Find the difference between David's and Sarah's marbles:\n   - Difference = David's marbles - Sarah's marbles\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations:\n\n1. Use the calculator to multiply 2 by 10 to find David's marble count\n2. Then, subtract Sarah's marble count (10) from David's marble count to find the difference\n\nThese calculations will give us the answer to how many more marbles David has than Sarah.\n",
