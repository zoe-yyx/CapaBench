    "observation": "David and Sarah have 30 marbles together. David has twice as many marbles as Sarah. How many marbles does David have more than Sarah?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total marbles: 30\n   - David has twice as many marbles as Sarah\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   - Let x = Sarah's marbles\n   - Then 2x = David's marbles\n   - Total marbles equation: x + 2x = 30\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify: 3x = 30\n   - Divide both sides by 3 to find x (Sarah's marbles)\n\n4. Calculate David's marbles:\n   - David's marbles = 2x\n\n5. Find the difference:\n   - Subtract Sarah's marbles from David's marbles\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the total of Sarah's and David's marbles equals 30\n   - Confirm that David has twice as many as Sarah\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State how many more marbles David has than Sarah\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations and the problem-solving strategy, we have successfully determined:\n\n1. Sarah has 10 marbles\n2. David has 20 marbles\n3. The difference between David's and Sarah's marble counts is 10\n\nNow, we need to verify our solution and present the final answer. Let's guide the acting agent through these final steps:\n\n1. Verify the solution:\n   a. Check if the total of Sarah's and David's marbles equals 30:\n      10 (Sarah's marbles) + 20 (David's marbles) = 30\n   b. Confirm that David has twice as many marbles as Sarah:\n      20 (David's marbles) = 2 * 10 (Sarah's marbles)\n\n2. Present the final answer:\n   We can now confidently state that David has 10 more marbles than Sarah.\n\nThe acting agent should perform these verification calculations to ensure the accuracy of our solution. Once verified, we can conclude that our answer is correct and complete.\n",
