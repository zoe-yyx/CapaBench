    "observation": "David and Sarah have 30 marbles together. David has twice as many marbles as Sarah. How many marbles does David have more than Sarah?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total marbles: 30\n   - David has twice as many marbles as Sarah\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   - Let x = Sarah's marbles\n   - Then 2x = David's marbles\n   - Total marbles equation: x + 2x = 30\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify: 3x = 30\n   - Divide both sides by 3 to find x (Sarah's marbles)\n\n4. Calculate David's marbles:\n   - David's marbles = 2x\n\n5. Find the difference:\n   - Subtract Sarah's marbles from David's marbles\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the total of Sarah's and David's marbles equals 30\n   - Confirm that David has twice as many as Sarah\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State how many more marbles David has than Sarah\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by setting up and solving the equation to determine how many marbles Sarah has. This is a crucial step that will allow us to calculate David's marbles and ultimately find the difference between their marble counts.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to solve the equation:\n\n1. Set up the equation: x + 2x = 30, where x represents Sarah's marbles\n2. Simplify the equation: 3x = 30\n3. Solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: x = 30 \u00f7 3\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform the division 30 \u00f7 3 to find the value of x, which represents Sarah's marbles. Once we have this value, we can proceed to calculate David's marbles and the difference between their marble counts.\n",
