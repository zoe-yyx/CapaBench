    "observation": "David and Sarah have 30 marbles together. David has twice as many marbles as Sarah. How many marbles does David have more than Sarah?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total marbles: 30\n   - David has twice as many marbles as Sarah\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   - Let x = Sarah's marbles\n   - Then 2x = David's marbles\n   - Total marbles equation: x + 2x = 30\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify: 3x = 30\n   - Divide both sides by 3 to find x (Sarah's marbles)\n\n4. Calculate David's marbles:\n   - David's marbles = 2x\n\n5. Find the difference:\n   - Subtract Sarah's marbles from David's marbles\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the total of Sarah's and David's marbles equals 30\n   - Confirm that David has twice as many as Sarah\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State how many more marbles David has than Sarah\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations and our problem-solving strategy, we've made significant progress. Let's analyze where we are:\n\n1. We've determined that Sarah has 10 marbles (x = 10).\n2. We've calculated that David has 20 marbles (2x = 2 * 10 = 20).\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between David's and Sarah's marble counts to answer the original question: \"How many marbles does David have more than Sarah?\"\n\nTo do this, we need to subtract Sarah's marble count from David's:\n\nDifference = David's marbles - Sarah's marbles\n           = 20 - 10\n\nThe acting agent should use the calculator to perform this subtraction. This will give us the final answer to our problem.\n\nAfter this calculation, we should verify our solution by checking if:\n1. The total of Sarah's and David's marbles equals 30\n2. David indeed has twice as many marbles as Sarah\n\nThese verification steps will ensure the accuracy of our solution.\n",
