    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation structure:\n   - Recognize that this is a product of two quadratic expressions set equal to zero.\n   - Understand that the roots of this equation will be the combined roots of both quadratic expressions.\n\n2. Solve the first quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring method to find its roots.\n\n3. Solve the second quadratic equation: x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\n   - Use the quadratic formula or factoring method to find its roots.\n\n4. Identify all distinct real roots:\n   - List all the roots found from steps 2 and 3.\n   - Eliminate any duplicate roots.\n\n5. Calculate the sum of all distinct real roots:\n   - Add all the unique roots identified in step 4.\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the sum makes sense given the original equation.\n   - Ensure all steps have been followed correctly.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any necessary calculations in steps 2, 3, and 5.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the result obtained, we can now analyze and reason about the solution:\n\n1. We successfully identified the roots of both quadratic equations:\n   - From (x^2 - 5x + 6) = 0, we found roots x = 2 and x = 3\n   - From (x^2 - 4x + 4) = 0, we found a double root x = 2\n\n2. We correctly identified that 2 is a repeated root, but should only be counted once when summing distinct real roots.\n\n3. The distinct real roots are indeed 2 and 3.\n\n4. The calculation of 2 + 3 = 5 is correct.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning confirms that 5 is the sum of all distinct real roots of the given equation.\n\nTo further verify this solution, we can guide the acting agent to check if this result makes sense in the context of the original equation. One way to do this is to substitute each root back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\nThe next logical step would be to ask the acting agent to verify the solution by substituting x = 2 and x = 3 into the original equation: (x^2 - 5x + 6)(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 0\n",
