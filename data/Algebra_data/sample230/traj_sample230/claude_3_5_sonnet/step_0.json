    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to break it down into solving two separate quadratic equations and then combine their roots. Let's start with the first quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nThis equation can be solved by factoring. It's a good idea to guide the acting agent to factor this equation. The factors should be (x - 2) and (x - 3), giving us roots of x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nFor the second quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\n\nThis one is a perfect square trinomial. It can be factored as (x - 2)^2 = 0, giving us a double root of x = 2.\n\nAfter solving both equations, we can see that we have three roots in total: 2 (occurring twice) and 3. However, we need to find the sum of all distinct real roots. Since 2 appears as a root in both equations, we only count it once.\n\nTherefore, our distinct real roots are 2 and 3. The next step should be to add these distinct roots together.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to add 2 + 3 to get the final answer.\n",
