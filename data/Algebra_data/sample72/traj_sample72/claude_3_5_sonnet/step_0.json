Apply the floor function to $\\sqrt{50}$:\n   - Determine $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{50}\\right\\rfloor$ based on the result from step 2\n\n4. Calculate $\\sqrt{49}$:\n   - Recognize that $\\sqrt{49}$ is a perfect square\n   - Determine its exact integer value\n\n5. Apply the ceiling function to $\\sqrt{49}$:\n   - Determine $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{49}\\right\\rceil$ based on the result from step 4\n\n6. Perform the subtraction:\n   - Subtract the result of step 5 from the result of step 3\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Ensure the final answer is a single integer value\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the given 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward calculations and function applications.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by calculating the square root of 50. This is the first step in evaluating $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{50}\\right\\rfloor$. \n\nThe square root of 50 is an irrational number, so we need to use a calculator to get an accurate approximation. Once we have this value, we can determine its integer part, which will give us the floor value we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use a calculator to compute $\\sqrt{50}$. This will give us the necessary information to proceed with applying the floor function and continue solving the problem.\n\nAfter calculating $\\sqrt{50}$, we'll be able to determine $\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{50}\\right\\rfloor$, which is the first part of our expression. Then we can move on to calculating $\\sqrt{49}$ and applying the ceiling function to it.\n",
