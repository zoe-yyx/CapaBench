    "observation": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = number of coins in the second pile\n   \n2. Express the other piles in terms of x:\n   First pile: 2x + 2\n   Third pile: 3x - 5\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   Total coins = First pile + Second pile + Third pile\n   63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   63 = 2x + 2 + x + 3x - 5\n   63 = 6x - 3\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   Add 3 to both sides: 66 = 6x\n   Divide both sides by 6: 11 = x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate coins in each pile using x = 11\n   - Ensure the total equals 63\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The second pile contains 11 coins\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic steps and arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the verification plan, we have successfully determined the number of coins in all three piles:\n\n- First pile: 24 coins\n- Second pile: 11 coins\n- Third pile: 28 coins\n\nThe next logical step is to perform the final verification by summing up the coins in all three piles to ensure they total 63 as stated in the original problem. This step is crucial to confirm that our solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this final calculation:\n\n24 + 11 + 28\n\nThis operation will give us the total number of coins across all three piles. If the result equals 63, we can confidently conclude that our solution is correct and that the second pile indeed contains 11 coins.\n\nAfter this verification, we will have completed all steps outlined in the planning strategy and can present the final answer to the problem.\n",
