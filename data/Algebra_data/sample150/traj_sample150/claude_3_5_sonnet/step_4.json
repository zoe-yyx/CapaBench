    "observation": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = number of coins in the second pile\n   \n2. Express the other piles in terms of x:\n   First pile: 2x + 2\n   Third pile: 3x - 5\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   Total coins = First pile + Second pile + Third pile\n   63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   63 = 2x + 2 + x + 3x - 5\n   63 = 6x - 3\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   Add 3 to both sides: 66 = 6x\n   Divide both sides by 6: 11 = x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate coins in each pile using x = 11\n   - Ensure the total equals 63\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The second pile contains 11 coins\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic steps and arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the verification plan, we have successfully determined the number of coins in the first pile (24) and second pile (11). The next logical step is to calculate the number of coins in the third pile to complete our verification process. Here's the reasoning for the next operation:\n\n1. We need to calculate the number of coins in the third pile using the formula: 3x - 5, where x = 11.\n\n2. Once we have this value, we can sum up all three piles to verify that they total 63 coins as stated in the original problem.\n\n3. If the sum matches 63, we can confidently conclude that our solution is correct.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the calculation for the third pile:\n\n3(11) - 5\n\nThis operation will give us the number of coins in the third pile. After this calculation, we'll be ready to sum up all three piles for the final verification step.\n",
