    "observation": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = number of coins in the second pile\n   \n2. Express the other piles in terms of x:\n   First pile: 2x + 2\n   Third pile: 3x - 5\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   Total coins = First pile + Second pile + Third pile\n   63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   63 = 2x + 2 + x + 3x - 5\n   63 = 6x - 3\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   Add 3 to both sides: 66 = 6x\n   Divide both sides by 6: 11 = x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate coins in each pile using x = 11\n   - Ensure the total equals 63\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The second pile contains 11 coins\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic steps and arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and our current progress, we have successfully solved for x, which represents the number of coins in the second pile. We found that x = 11. Now, it's time to verify our solution to ensure it satisfies all conditions of the original problem. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to calculate the number of coins in each pile using x = 11:\n   - Second pile: x = 11 coins\n   - First pile: 2x + 2 = 2(11) + 2 = 24 coins\n   - Third pile: 3x - 5 = 3(11) - 5 = 28 coins\n\n2. We should verify that the total number of coins in all three piles equals 63:\n   24 + 11 + 28 = 63\n\n3. If the verification is successful, we can conclude that our solution is correct.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations step by step. First, we should calculate the number of coins in the first pile:\n\n2(11) + 2\n\nThis operation will give us the number of coins in the first pile, which we can then use in our final verification step.\n",
