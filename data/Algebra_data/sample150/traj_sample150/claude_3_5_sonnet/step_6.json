    "observation": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = number of coins in the second pile\n   \n2. Express the other piles in terms of x:\n   First pile: 2x + 2\n   Third pile: 3x - 5\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   Total coins = First pile + Second pile + Third pile\n   63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   63 = 2x + 2 + x + 3x - 5\n   63 = 6x - 3\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   Add 3 to both sides: 66 = 6x\n   Divide both sides by 6: 11 = x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate coins in each pile using x = 11\n   - Ensure the total equals 63\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The second pile contains 11 coins\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic steps and arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the original problem, our planning strategy, and the historical actions taken, we have successfully solved and verified our solution. Here's a summary of our reasoning:\n\n1. We solved the equation and found that x = 11, representing the number of coins in the second pile.\n\n2. We then verified this solution by calculating the number of coins in each pile:\n   - First pile: 2x + 2 = 2(11) + 2 = 24 coins\n   - Second pile: x = 11 coins\n   - Third pile: 3x - 5 = 3(11) - 5 = 28 coins\n\n3. We've just confirmed that the sum of all three piles is indeed 63 coins (24 + 11 + 28 = 63), which matches the total given in the original problem.\n\nOur solution is now fully verified and meets all conditions of the problem. The next logical step would be to formulate a clear and concise answer to the original question.\n\nThe acting agent should now present the final answer: The second pile contains 11 coins.\n\nThis concludes our problem-solving process, as we have successfully determined and verified the number of coins in the second pile.\n",
