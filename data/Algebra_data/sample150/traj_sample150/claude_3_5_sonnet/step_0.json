    "observation": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = number of coins in the second pile\n   \n2. Express the other piles in terms of x:\n   First pile: 2x + 2\n   Third pile: 3x - 5\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   Total coins = First pile + Second pile + Third pile\n   63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   63 = 2x + 2 + x + 3x - 5\n   63 = 6x - 3\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   Add 3 to both sides: 66 = 6x\n   Divide both sides by 6: 11 = x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate coins in each pile using x = 11\n   - Ensure the total equals 63\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The second pile contains 11 coins\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic steps and arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the equation that represents the total number of coins in all three piles. We know the total is 63, and we've expressed each pile in terms of x, where x is the number of coins in the second pile.\n\nThe equation is:\n63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\nThe next logical step is to simplify this equation by combining like terms. This will involve basic algebraic manipulation.\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to perform the following steps:\n1. Combine all terms containing x on one side of the equation\n2. Combine all constant terms on the other side\n3. Simplify the resulting equation\n\nThis operation will prepare us for solving for x in the subsequent steps.\n",
