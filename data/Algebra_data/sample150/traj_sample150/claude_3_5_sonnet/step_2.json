    "observation": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = number of coins in the second pile\n   \n2. Express the other piles in terms of x:\n   First pile: 2x + 2\n   Third pile: 3x - 5\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   Total coins = First pile + Second pile + Third pile\n   63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   63 = 2x + 2 + x + 3x - 5\n   63 = 6x - 3\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   Add 3 to both sides: 66 = 6x\n   Divide both sides by 6: 11 = x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate coins in each pile using x = 11\n   - Ensure the total equals 63\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The second pile contains 11 coins\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic steps and arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have added 3 to both sides of the equation, we have:\n\n66 = 6x\n\nThis simplified equation is ready for the final step to solve for x. The next logical operation is to divide both sides of the equation by 6. This will isolate x and give us the value we're looking for - the number of coins in the second pile.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division:\n\n66 \u00f7 6 = x\n\nThis operation will directly solve for x, giving us the number of coins in the second pile. Once we have this value, we can proceed to verify the solution by calculating the number of coins in each pile and checking if they sum to 63 as stated in the original problem.\n",
