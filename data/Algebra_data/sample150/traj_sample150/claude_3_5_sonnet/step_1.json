    "observation": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = number of coins in the second pile\n   \n2. Express the other piles in terms of x:\n   First pile: 2x + 2\n   Third pile: 3x - 5\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   Total coins = First pile + Second pile + Third pile\n   63 = (2x + 2) + x + (3x - 5)\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   63 = 2x + 2 + x + 3x - 5\n   63 = 6x - 3\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   Add 3 to both sides: 66 = 6x\n   Divide both sides by 6: 11 = x\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate coins in each pile using x = 11\n   - Ensure the total equals 63\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   The second pile contains 11 coins\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic algebraic steps and arithmetic calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we have already simplified the equation. The next logical step is to solve this simplified equation for x. Here's the reasoning for the next operation:\n\n1. We have the simplified equation: 63 = 6x - 3\n2. To isolate x, we need to perform two operations:\n   a) Add 3 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term\n   b) Divide both sides by 6 to solve for x\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these operations step by step. The first step should be to add 3 to both sides of the equation. This will simplify our equation further and bring us closer to solving for x, which represents the number of coins in the second pile.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this addition:\n63 + 3 = 6x - 3 + 3\n\nThis operation will eliminate the constant term on the right side of the equation, making it easier to solve for x in the next step.\n",
