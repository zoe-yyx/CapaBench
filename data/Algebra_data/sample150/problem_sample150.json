    "problem": "Consider three piles of coins. The first pile has 2 more coins than twice the number in the second pile. The third pile has 5 fewer than three times the number in the second pile. If the total number of coins in all three piles is 63, how many coins are in the second pile?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of coins in the second pile be $y$. Then the first pile has $2y + 2$ coins, and the third pile has $3y - 5$ coins. The equation for the total coins is $2y + 2 + y + 3y - 5 = 63$. Simplifying, we get $6y - 3 = 63$. Solving for $y$, we add 3 to both sides to get $6y = 66$, and then divide by 6 to find $y = \\boxed{11}$. Therefore, there are approximately 11 coins in the second pile.",
