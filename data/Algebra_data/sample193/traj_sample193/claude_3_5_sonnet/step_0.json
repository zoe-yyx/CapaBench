    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify and clarify key information:\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence\n   - First term (a\u2081) = 100\n   - Common difference (d) = 3\n   - Number of terms (n) = 40\n   - Goal: Find the sum of first 40 terms\n\n2. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   S_n = (n/2)(a\u2081 + a\u2099)\n   Where S_n is the sum of n terms, a\u2081 is the first term, and a\u2099 is the last term\n\n3. Calculate the last term (a\u2084\u2080):\n   - Use the formula: a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n-1)d\n   - Plug in values: a\u2084\u2080 = 100 + (40-1)3\n\n4. Apply the sum formula:\n   - Plug in n = 40, a\u2081 = 100, and the calculated a\u2084\u2080\n\n5. Perform the final calculation to get the sum\n\n6.
