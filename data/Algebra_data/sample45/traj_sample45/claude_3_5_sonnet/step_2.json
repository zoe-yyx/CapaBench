    "observation": "Tom eats 2 apples on the first day and increases his consumption by 1 apple each subsequent day. How many apples does he eat in the first 7 days?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the pattern:\n   - Tom starts with 2 apples on day 1\n   - He increases consumption by 1 apple each day\n\n2. List out the number of apples eaten each day:\n   Day 1: 2 apples\n   Day 2: 3 apples\n   Day 3: 4 apples\n   ...and so on until Day 7\n\n3. Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a1) = 2\n   - Common difference (d) = 1\n   - Number of terms (n) = 7\n\n4. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   Sum = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   Where an is the last term (apples eaten on day 7)\n\n5. Calculate the last term (an):\n   an = a1 + (n - 1)d\n   an = 2 + (7 - 1)1 = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n6. Apply the sum formula:\n   Sum = 7(2 + 8) / 2\n\n7. Perform the final calculation to get the total number of apples eaten in 7 days\n\n8. Double-check the result by manually summing up the apples eaten each day\n\n9. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions taken, we have already identified the pattern and listed out the number of apples eaten each day. We've also recognized this as an arithmetic sequence and recalled the formula for its sum.\n\nThe next logical step in our reasoning process is to actually perform the calculation using the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence. We have all the necessary information:\n\n- Number of terms (n) = 7\n- First term (a1) = 2\n- Last term (an) = 8 (which was calculated in step 5 of the planning strategy)\n\nNow, we need to plug these values into the formula:\n\nSum = n(a1 + an) / 2\nSum = 7(2 + 8) / 2\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation. This will give us the total number of apples Tom ate over the 7 days.\n\nAfter this calculation, we should proceed to step 8 in the planning strategy, which is to double-check the result by manually summing up the apples eaten each day. This will serve as a verification of our calculated result.\n",
