    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the pattern:\n   - Tom starts with 2 apples on day 1\n   - He increases consumption by 1 apple each day\n\n2. List out the number of apples eaten each day:\n   Day 1: 2 apples\n   Day 2: 3 apples\n   Day 3: 4 apples\n   ...and so on until Day 7\n\n3. Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a1) = 2\n   - Common difference (d) = 1\n   - Number of terms (n) = 7\n\n4. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   Sum = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   Where an is the last term (apples eaten on day 7)\n\n5. Calculate the last term (an):\n   an = a1 + (n - 1)d\n   an = 2 + (7 - 1)1 = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n6. Apply the sum formula:\n   Sum = 7(2 + 8) / 2\n\n7. Perform the final calculation to get the total number of apples eaten in 7 days\n\n8. Double-check the result by manually summing up the apples eaten each day\n\n9. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy, we should start by listing out the number of apples Tom eats each day for the first 7 days. This will help us visualize the arithmetic sequence and confirm our understanding of the pattern. \n\nThe acting agent should create a list showing the number of apples eaten each day, starting from day 1 to day 7. This will serve as a foundation for our calculations and help us verify our results later.\n\nThe list should look like this:\nDay 1: 2 apples\nDay 2: 3 apples\nDay 3: 4 apples\nDay 4: 5 apples\nDay 5: 6 apples\nDay 6: 7 apples\nDay 7: 8 apples\n\nCreating this list will also confirm that our understanding of the last term (an) is correct, which we calculated as 8 in step 5 of the planning strategy.\n\nAfter creating this list, we can proceed with applying the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence in the next step.\n",
