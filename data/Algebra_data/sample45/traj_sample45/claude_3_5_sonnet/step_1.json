    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the pattern:\n   - Tom starts with 2 apples on day 1\n   - He increases consumption by 1 apple each day\n\n2. List out the number of apples eaten each day:\n   Day 1: 2 apples\n   Day 2: 3 apples\n   Day 3: 4 apples\n   ...and so on until Day 7\n\n3. Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a1) = 2\n   - Common difference (d) = 1\n   - Number of terms (n) = 7\n\n4. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   Sum = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   Where an is the last term (apples eaten on day 7)\n\n5. Calculate the last term (an):\n   an = a1 + (n - 1)d\n   an = 2 + (7 - 1)1 = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n6. Apply the sum formula:\n   Sum = 7(2 + 8) / 2\n\n7. Perform the final calculation to get the total number of apples eaten in 7 days\n\n8. Double-check the result by manually summing up the apples eaten each day\n\n9. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we should proceed with listing out the number of apples eaten each day for the first 7 days. This will help us visualize the pattern and confirm the arithmetic sequence.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to create this list:\n\nDay 1: 2 apples (starting point)\nDay 2: 3 apples (2 + 1)\nDay 3: 4 apples (3 + 1)\nDay 4: 5 apples (4 + 1)\nDay 5: 6 apples (5 + 1)\nDay 6: 7 apples (6 + 1)\nDay 7: 8 apples (7 + 1)\n\nThis list confirms our arithmetic sequence:\n- First term (a1) = 2\n- Last term (a7) = 8\n- Number of terms (n) = 7\n\nNow that we have this list, we can proceed to calculate the sum using the formula for arithmetic sequences or by adding up all the numbers. Both methods will serve as a good cross-check for our final answer.\n",
