    "observation": "Tom eats 2 apples on the first day and increases his consumption by 1 apple each subsequent day. How many apples does he eat in the first 7 days?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the pattern:\n   - Tom starts with 2 apples on day 1\n   - He increases consumption by 1 apple each day\n\n2. List out the number of apples eaten each day:\n   Day 1: 2 apples\n   Day 2: 3 apples\n   Day 3: 4 apples\n   ...and so on until Day 7\n\n3. Recognize this as an arithmetic sequence:\n   - First term (a1) = 2\n   - Common difference (d) = 1\n   - Number of terms (n) = 7\n\n4. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   Sum = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   Where an is the last term (apples eaten on day 7)\n\n5. Calculate the last term (an):\n   an = a1 + (n - 1)d\n   an = 2 + (7 - 1)1 = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n6. Apply the sum formula:\n   Sum = 7(2 + 8) / 2\n\n7. Perform the final calculation to get the total number of apples eaten in 7 days\n\n8. Double-check the result by manually summing up the apples eaten each day\n\n9. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, we have successfully calculated the total number of apples Tom ate over the 7 days using the arithmetic sequence formula. The result we obtained is 35 apples.\n\nNow, to ensure the accuracy of our result, we should proceed with step 8 of our planning strategy: double-checking the result by manually summing up the apples eaten each day. This verification step is crucial to confirm our calculation and increase confidence in our answer.\n\nTo do this, we need to:\n\n1. List out the number of apples eaten each day from day 1 to day 7.\n2. Sum up these numbers manually.\n\nThis manual calculation will serve as a cross-check against our formula-based result of 35 apples. If both methods yield the same result, we can be confident in our answer. If there's a discrepancy, we'll need to review our calculations and approach.\n\nAfter this verification step, we can move on to the final step of presenting the answer to the original problem.\n",
