    "observation": "In a magical forest, there are animals that can speak human languages. A wizard hears from a rabbit, a deer, and a fox. The rabbit says that the sum of the ages of the deer and the fox is twice his age. The deer claims that the sum of the ages of the rabbit and the fox is three times his age. If the total age of the rabbit, deer, and fox is 60 years, how old is the fox?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let r = rabbit's age\n       d = deer's age\n       f = fox's age\n\n2. Set up equations based on the given information:\n   a) d + f = 2r (rabbit's statement)\n   b) r + f = 3d (deer's statement)\n   c) r + d + f = 60 (total age)\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Rearrange equation (a): f = 2r - d\n   b) Substitute this into equation (b): r + (2r - d) = 3d\n   c) Simplify: 3r - d = 3d\n   d) Solve for r in terms of d: r = 4d/3\n\n4. Substitute the expressions for r and f into equation (c):\n   (4d/3) + d + (2(4d/3) - d) = 60\n\n5. Solve the resulting equation for d:\n   a) Simplify the equation\n   b) Solve for d\n\n6. Use the value of d to find r and f:\n   a) Calculate r using r = 4d/3\n   b) Calculate f using f = 2r - d or f = 60 - r - d\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   Check if the calculated ages satisfy all the original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   The age of the fox (f)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing algebraic manipulation and basic arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the equations using the variables we defined. The first step is to express these equations mathematically:\n\n1. d + f = 2r (rabbit's statement)\n2. r + f = 3d (deer's statement)\n3. r + d + f = 60 (total age)\n\nThese equations form a system that we can solve to find the ages of all three animals. The next logical step would be to manipulate these equations to isolate one variable, preferably in terms of another. \n\nLet's start by rearranging the first equation to express f in terms of r and d:\n\nf = 2r - d\n\nThis expression for f can be substituted into the second and third equations to eliminate one variable from our system. This will simplify our problem and bring us closer to finding a solution.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator or perform these algebraic manipulations to continue solving the system of equations.\n",
