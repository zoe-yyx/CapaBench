    "observation": "In a magical forest, there are animals that can speak human languages. A wizard hears from a rabbit, a deer, and a fox. The rabbit says that the sum of the ages of the deer and the fox is twice his age. The deer claims that the sum of the ages of the rabbit and the fox is three times his age. If the total age of the rabbit, deer, and fox is 60 years, how old is the fox?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let r = rabbit's age\n       d = deer's age\n       f = fox's age\n\n2. Set up equations based on the given information:\n   a) d + f = 2r (rabbit's statement)\n   b) r + f = 3d (deer's statement)\n   c) r + d + f = 60 (total age)\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Rearrange equation (a): f = 2r - d\n   b) Substitute this into equation (b): r + (2r - d) = 3d\n   c) Simplify: 3r - d = 3d\n   d) Solve for r in terms of d: r = 4d/3\n\n4. Substitute the expressions for r and f into equation (c):\n   (4d/3) + d + (2(4d/3) - d) = 60\n\n5. Solve the resulting equation for d:\n   a) Simplify the equation\n   b) Solve for d\n\n6. Use the value of d to find r and f:\n   a) Calculate r using r = 4d/3\n   b) Calculate f using f = 2r - d or f = 60 - r - d\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   Check if the calculated ages satisfy all the original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   The age of the fox (f)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing algebraic manipulation and basic arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous action and our planning strategy, we have successfully rearranged the equations and substituted f = 2r - d into the second equation. Now we have:\n\nr + (2r - d) = 3d\n\nThis equation can be simplified further to isolate r in terms of d. Let's reason through the next steps:\n\n1. Expand the brackets: r + 2r - d = 3d\n2. Combine like terms: 3r - d = 3d\n3. Add d to both sides: 3r = 4d\n4. Divide both sides by 3: r = 4d/3\n\nThis gives us an expression for r in terms of d, which is exactly what we were aiming for in step 3b of our plan.\n\nThe next logical step is to substitute this expression for r, along with our previous expression for f (f = 2r - d), into the third equation from our original system:\n\nr + d + f = 60\n\nBy doing this substitution, we'll create an equation with only one variable (d), which we can then solve to find the deer's age. Once we have the deer's age, we can easily calculate the ages of the rabbit and the fox.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should substitute r = 4d/3 and f = 2r - d into the equation r + d + f = 60, and simplify the resulting equation.\n",
