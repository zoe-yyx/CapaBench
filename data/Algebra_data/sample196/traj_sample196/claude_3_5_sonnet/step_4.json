    "observation": "In a magical forest, there are animals that can speak human languages. A wizard hears from a rabbit, a deer, and a fox. The rabbit says that the sum of the ages of the deer and the fox is twice his age. The deer claims that the sum of the ages of the rabbit and the fox is three times his age. If the total age of the rabbit, deer, and fox is 60 years, how old is the fox?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Define variables:\n   Let r = rabbit's age\n       d = deer's age\n       f = fox's age\n\n2. Set up equations based on the given information:\n   a) d + f = 2r (rabbit's statement)\n   b) r + f = 3d (deer's statement)\n   c) r + d + f = 60 (total age)\n\n3. Solve the system of equations:\n   a) Rearrange equation (a): f = 2r - d\n   b) Substitute this into equation (b): r + (2r - d) = 3d\n   c) Simplify: 3r - d = 3d\n   d) Solve for r in terms of d: r = 4d/3\n\n4. Substitute the expressions for r and f into equation (c):\n   (4d/3) + d + (2(4d/3) - d) = 60\n\n5. Solve the resulting equation for d:\n   a) Simplify the equation\n   b) Solve for d\n\n6. Use the value of d to find r and f:\n   a) Calculate r using r = 4d/3\n   b) Calculate f using f = 2r - d or f = 60 - r - d\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   Check if the calculated ages satisfy all the original conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   The age of the fox (f)\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing algebraic manipulation and basic arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the planning strategy, we have made significant progress. Let's analyze our current state and determine the next steps:\n\n1. We have found the deer's age: d = 15\n2. We have just calculated the rabbit's age: r = 20\n\nNow that we have the ages of the deer and the rabbit, we can proceed to find the fox's age using our previously derived expression:\n\nf = 2r - d\n\nWe have all the values needed to calculate this:\n- r = 20 (rabbit's age)\n- d = 15 (deer's age)\n\nThe next logical step is to substitute these values into our expression for f and calculate the result. This will give us the fox's age, which is the final answer to our original problem.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to compute 2 * 20 - 15 to find the fox's age (f).\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have solved the problem completely. As a final step, we should verify that our solution satisfies all the original conditions stated in the problem.\n",
