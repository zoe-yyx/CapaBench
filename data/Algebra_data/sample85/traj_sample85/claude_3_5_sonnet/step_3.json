Choose solution method: Use the quadratic formula to solve this equation. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\n3. Calculate discriminant: Compute b^2 - 4ac to determine the nature of the roots.\n\n4. Apply quadratic formula: Substitute the values into the quadratic formula to find both roots.\n\n5. Identify larger root: Compare the two roots to determine which one is larger.\n\n6. Verify the solution: Check the answer by substituting it back into the original equation.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for precise calculations, especially when computing the square root in the quadratic formula.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated both roots of the quadratic equation, we can analyze our results:\n\n1. First root: (-6 + 4) / 2 = -1\n2. Second root: (-6 - 4) / 2 = -5\n\nTo find the bigger root, we need to compare these two values. Clearly, -1 is greater than -5.\n\nTherefore, the bigger root of the equation x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0 is -1.\n\nTo verify this solution, we should substitute this value back into the original equation. The acting agent should use a calculator to check:\n\n(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 5 = 0\n\nIf this equation holds true, it will confirm that our solution is correct.\n\nAfter this verification, we will have completely solved the problem and found the bigger root as requested.\n",
