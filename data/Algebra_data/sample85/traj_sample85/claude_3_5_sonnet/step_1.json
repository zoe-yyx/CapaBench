Choose solution method: Use the quadratic formula to solve this equation. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\n3. Calculate discriminant: Compute b^2 - 4ac to determine the nature of the roots.\n\n4. Apply quadratic formula: Substitute the values into the quadratic formula to find both roots.\n\n5. Identify larger root: Compare the two roots to determine which one is larger.\n\n6. Verify the solution: Check the answer by substituting it back into the original equation.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for precise calculations, especially when computing the square root in the quadratic formula.\n",
