Simplify the second equation:\n   - Rewrite $16^{2y-1} = 2$ as $(2^4)^{2y-1} = 2$\n   - Simplify the left side using exponent rules\n   - Solve for y\n\n3.

Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the calculated value satisfies both original equations\n\nKey points to consider:\n- Use logarithms or exponent rules to solve for x and y\n- Pay attention to the base of each exponential expression\n- Be prepared to work with fractions or decimal values for x and y\n- The final answer may be a fraction, decimal, or integer\n",
