    "observation": "In an arithmetic sequence, the first term is 3, and the sum of the first 10 terms is 145. What is the common difference of the sequence?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   S_n = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n), where S_n is the sum, n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the last term.\n\n2. Identify the known values:\n   - First term (a_1) = 3\n   - Number of terms (n) = 10\n   - Sum of first 10 terms (S_10) = 145\n\n3. Express the last term (a_10) in terms of the common difference (d):\n   a_10 = a_1 + (n-1)d = 3 + 9d\n\n4. Substitute the known values and the expression for a_10 into the sum formula:\n   145 = (10/2)(3 + (3 + 9d))\n\n5. Simplify and solve the equation for d:\n   - Expand the equation\n   - Isolate d\n   - Calculate the value of d\n\n6. Verify the solution by calculating the sum of the first 10 terms using the found common difference.\n\n7. Present the final answer: the common difference of the sequence.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence and the information provided. Let's start by setting up the equation using the known values:\n\n1. We know that S_10 = 145, a_1 = 3, and n = 10.\n2. We can express a_10 as a_1 + 9d, where d is the common difference we're trying to find.\n3. Let's substitute these into the sum formula:\n\n   145 = (10/2)(3 + (3 + 9d))\n\nThis equation contains all the information we need to solve for d. The next step should be to simplify this equation and solve for d. We should guide the acting agent to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Simplify the right side of the equation:\n   145 = 5(6 + 9d)\n2. Distribute the 5:\n   145 = 30 + 45d\n3. Subtract 30 from both sides:\n   115 = 45d\n4. Divide both sides by 45 to isolate d:\n   d = 115 / 45\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these operations, especially the final division to get the exact value of d.\n",
