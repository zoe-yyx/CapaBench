    "observation": "In an arithmetic sequence, the first term is 3, and the sum of the first 10 terms is 145. What is the common difference of the sequence?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   S_n = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n), where S_n is the sum, n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the last term.\n\n2. Identify the known values:\n   - First term (a_1) = 3\n   - Number of terms (n) = 10\n   - Sum of first 10 terms (S_10) = 145\n\n3. Express the last term (a_10) in terms of the common difference (d):\n   a_10 = a_1 + (n-1)d = 3 + 9d\n\n4. Substitute the known values and the expression for a_10 into the sum formula:\n   145 = (10/2)(3 + (3 + 9d))\n\n5. Simplify and solve the equation for d:\n   - Expand the equation\n   - Isolate d\n   - Calculate the value of d\n\n6. Verify the solution by calculating the sum of the first 10 terms using the found common difference.\n\n7. Present the final answer: the common difference of the sequence.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations and verifications we've performed, we can confidently reason about the solution to this problem:\n\n1. We have confirmed that the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence is 23/9 or approximately 2.5555...\n\n2. This value satisfies our original equation derived from the sum formula:\n   145 = 5(6 + 9d)\n\n3. We've also verified that using this common difference, the 10th term of the sequence is indeed 26, which is consistent with our expectations.\n\n4. Let's break down what this means for the sequence:\n   - The first term (a1) is 3\n   - Each subsequent term increases by 23/9 (approximately 2.5555...)\n   - The 10th term (a10) is 26\n\n5. We can now fully describe the arithmetic sequence:\n   3, 5.5555..., 8.1111..., 10.6666..., 13.2222..., 15.7777..., 18.3333..., 20.8888..., 23.4444..., 26\n\n6. This sequence does indeed have 10 terms, starts with 3, and ends with 26, which is consistent with all the information given in the original problem.\n\n7. The sum of these terms is 145, as required by the problem statement.\n\nGiven all these confirmations, we can conclude that our solution is correct and complete. The common difference of the sequence is 23/9, which answers the original question posed in the problem.\n\nNo further calculations or actions are necessary at this point. We have fully solved and verified the problem.\n",
