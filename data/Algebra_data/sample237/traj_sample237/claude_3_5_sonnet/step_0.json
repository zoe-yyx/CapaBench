    "observation": "Given the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x - 5}{3x^2 - x - 14}$, find all values of $x$ that would make $f(x)$ undefined. Express your answer in set notation.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the condition for f(x) to be undefined:\n   - A fraction is undefined when its denominator equals zero.\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n   - Set the denominator equal to zero: 3x^2 - x - 14 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 3, b = -1, and c = -14\n\n4. Calculate the discriminant:\n   - Calculate b^2 - 4ac\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - If the discriminant is positive, there will be two real solutions.\n   - If the discriminant is zero, there will be one real solution.\n   - If the discriminant is negative, there will be no real solutions.\n\n6. Express the solution in set notation:\n   - Use curly braces {} to enclose the values of x that make f(x) undefined.\n\n7. Double-check the solution:\n   - Verify that the found x values indeed make the denominator zero.\n\n8. Formulate the final answer in set notation.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for numerical computations when needed.\n",
