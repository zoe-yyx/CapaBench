    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the condition for f(x) to be undefined:\n   - A fraction is undefined when its denominator equals zero.\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n   - Set the denominator equal to zero: 3x^2 - x - 14 = 0\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 3, b = -1, and c = -14\n\n4. Calculate the discriminant:\n   - Calculate b^2 - 4ac\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - If the discriminant is positive, there will be two real solutions.\n   - If the discriminant is zero, there will be one real solution.\n   - If the discriminant is negative, there will be no real solutions.\n\n6. Express the solution in set notation:\n   - Use curly braces {} to enclose the values of x that make f(x) undefined.\n\n7. Double-check the solution:\n   - Verify that the found x values indeed make the denominator zero.\n\n8. Formulate the final answer in set notation.\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for numerical computations when needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated the discriminant and confirmed that there are two real solutions to our quadratic equation. We've also set up the calculations for these two solutions using the quadratic formula.\n\nOur next logical step is to complete these calculations to find the exact values of x that make f(x) undefined. We've already calculated x1 = (1 + 13) / 6 = 2.33333333333333.\n\nNow, we need to calculate x2 = (1 - 13) / 6. This will give us our second solution.\n\nAfter obtaining both x values, we'll be able to express our final answer in set notation, which is the last step in our problem-solving strategy.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the calculator to compute (1 - 13) / 6 to find the value of x2.\n",
