    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the nature of the problem, our reasoning should focus on setting up and solving the inequality that defines the domain of the square root function. Here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We need to ensure that the expression under the square root is non-negative. This means we should set up the inequality:\n\n   9 - (x-3)^2 \u2265 0\n\n2. This inequality represents the key constraint for the domain of the function. Solving this inequality will give us the range of values for x where the square root is defined.\n\n3. To solve this inequality, we should:\n   a) First, isolate the squared term: (x-3)^2 \u2264 9\n   b) Then, take the square root of both sides. Remember, when we do this, we need to consider both positive and negative roots:\n      -3 \u2264 x-3 \u2264 3\n\n4. The next step would be to solve this compound inequality for x by adding 3 to all parts:\n   0 \u2264 x \u2264 6\n\n5. This result gives us the range of x values that satisfy the original constraint.\n\nThe acting agent should now proceed to verify this solution and express it in proper interval notation.\n",
