Determine the domain constraint:\n   - Recall that for a square root to be defined, the expression under it must be non-negative\n\n3. Set up the inequality:\n   - Write 9 - (x-3)^2 \u2265 0\n\n4. Solve the inequality:\n   - Rearrange the inequality: (x-3)^2 \u2264 9\n   - Take the square root of both sides, considering both positive and negative roots\n   - Solve for x\n\n5. Express the solution in interval notation:\n   - Determine the lower and upper bounds for x\n   - Write the final answer using proper interval notation\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints of the interval satisfy the original expression\n   - Ensure the interval makes sense in the context of the problem\n\n7.

Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with the inequality: 9 - (x-3)^2 \u2265 0\n\n2. Rearranging this, we get: (x-3)^2 \u2264 9\n\n3. Taking the square root of both sides:\n   -3 \u2264 x-3 \u2264 3\n   (We consider both positive and negative roots because the square root of a number can be positive or negative)\n\n4. Solving for x:\n   0 \u2264 x \u2264 6\n   (We add 3 to each part of the inequality)\n\n5. Therefore, the range of x is from 0 to 6, inclusive.\n\n6. In interval notation, this is written as [0, 6].\n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to verify this solution by checking if the endpoints (0 and 6) satisfy the original expression, and to ensure that this interval makes sense in the context of the problem.\n",
