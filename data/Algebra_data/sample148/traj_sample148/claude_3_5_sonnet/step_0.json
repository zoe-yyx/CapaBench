Analyze the system of equations:\n   - Identify that we have two equations with two variables (x and y) and an unknown constant c.\n   - Note that the coefficients in the second equation are double those in the first equation.\n\n2. Compare the two equations:\n   - Observe the relationship between the left sides of both equations.\n   - Recognize that for a solution to exist, the right sides must have a specific relationship as well.\n\n3. Establish a relationship between the equations:\n   - Express the second equation in terms of the first equation.\n   - Use this relationship to determine a condition for c.\n\n4. Solve for c:\n   - Set up an equation based on the relationship found in step 3.\n   - Solve this equation to find the value of c.\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of c back into the original system.\n   - Check if the system now has a solution (infinitely many solutions in this case).\n\n6. Conclude:\n   - State the final value of c that allows the system to have a solution.\n   - Explain why this value of c works.\n\nNote: This plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may need to use a calculator for simple arithmetic, but no complex calculations or external searches should be necessary.\n",
