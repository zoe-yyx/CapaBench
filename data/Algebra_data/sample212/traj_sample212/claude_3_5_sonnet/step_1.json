    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equation:\n   - Identify the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS)\n   - Note that the equation holds true for all non-zero a, b, and c\n\n2. Simplify the left-hand side:\n   - Combine like terms in the exponents for a, b, and c\n   - Aim to express LHS in the form a^x * b^y * c^z\n\n3. Compare the simplified LHS with the RHS:\n   - Since the equation holds for all non-zero a, b, and c, the exponents must be equal\n   - Set up a system of equations for the exponents of a, b, and c\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Find the values of m, n, and p in terms of each other or constants\n\n5. Calculate m^n * p:\n   - Use the values or relationships found in step 4\n   - Simplify the expression if possible\n\n6. Express the final answer as a fraction:\n   - Ensure the result is in the form of a simple fraction\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation to check\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of m^n * p as a fraction\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem systematically within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the historical action of simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we should now focus on carrying out this simplification and setting up the system of equations. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Let's simplify the left-hand side by combining the exponents for each variable:\n\n   For a: (2m-3) - (m+1) = m-4\n   For b: (n+5) - (2n) = -n+5\n   For c: (4p-1) - (3p+2) = p-3\n\n2. After simplification, the left-hand side becomes:\n   \n   a^(m-4) * b^(-n+5) * c^(p-3)\n\n3. Now, we can set this equal to the right-hand side:\n\n   a^(m-4) * b^(-n+5) * c^(p-3) = abc\n\n4. For this equation to be true for all non-zero a, b, and c, the exponents on both sides must be equal for each variable. This gives us a system of equations:\n\n   m - 4 = 1\n   -n + 5 = 1\n   p - 3 = 1\n\nThe next logical step would be to solve this system of equations to find the values of m, n, and p. The acting agent should focus on solving these equations.\n",
