    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equation:\n   - Identify the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS)\n   - Note that the equation holds true for all non-zero a, b, and c\n\n2. Simplify the left-hand side:\n   - Combine like terms in the exponents for a, b, and c\n   - Aim to express LHS in the form a^x * b^y * c^z\n\n3. Compare the simplified LHS with the RHS:\n   - Since the equation holds for all non-zero a, b, and c, the exponents must be equal\n   - Set up a system of equations for the exponents of a, b, and c\n\n4. Solve the system of equations:\n   - Find the values of m, n, and p in terms of each other or constants\n\n5. Calculate m^n * p:\n   - Use the values or relationships found in step 4\n   - Simplify the expression if possible\n\n6. Express the final answer as a fraction:\n   - Ensure the result is in the form of a simple fraction\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found values back into the original equation to check\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of m^n * p as a fraction\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem systematically within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the problem, we should start by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation. This will allow us to compare it with the right-hand side and set up a system of equations. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We need to combine like terms in the exponents for a, b, and c in the numerator and denominator of the left-hand side.\n\n2. For 'a':\n   - In the numerator: a^(2m-3)\n   - In the denominator: a^(m+1)\n   - We should subtract these exponents\n\n3. For 'b':\n   - In the numerator: b^(n+5)\n   - In the denominator: b^(2n)\n   - We should subtract these exponents\n\n4. For 'c':\n   - In the numerator: c^(4p-1)\n   - In the denominator: c^(3p+2)\n   - We should subtract these exponents\n\n5. After simplification, we'll compare the result with the right-hand side (abc) to set up equations for the exponents.\n\nThis reasoning will guide the acting agent to perform the necessary algebraic simplifications on the left-hand side of the equation.\n",
