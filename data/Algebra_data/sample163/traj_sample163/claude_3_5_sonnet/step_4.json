    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   - Recognize that $3^{x+1} = 3 \\cdot 3^x$\n   - Rewrite the equation as $3 \\cdot 3^x + 3^x = 30$\n   - Factor out $3^x$: $3^x(3 + 1) = 30$\n   - Simplify: $4 \\cdot 3^x = 30$\n\n2. Isolate $3^x$:\n   - Divide both sides by 4: $3^x = \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5$\n\n3. Solve for x using logarithms:\n   - Apply $\\log_3$ to both sides: $\\log_3(3^x) = \\log_3(7.5)$\n   - Simplify the left side: $x = \\log_3(7.5)$\n\n4. Calculate the value of $\\log_3(7.5)$:\n   - Use the change of base formula: $\\log_3(7.5) = \\frac{\\log(7.5)}{\\log(3)}$\n   - Use a calculator to compute this value\n\n5. Round the result to 2 decimal places.\n\n6. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation.\n",
