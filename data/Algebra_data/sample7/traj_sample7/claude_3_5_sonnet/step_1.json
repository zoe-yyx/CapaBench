    "observation": "A can of soda contains 150 calories in 350 ml. How many calories are in 500 ml of the same soda? Express your answer in decimal form and round to 2 decimal places.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 350 ml of soda contains 150 calories\n   - We need to find calories in 500 ml of the same soda\n\n2. Determine the approach:\n   - Calculate the calories per ml of soda\n   - Use this ratio to find calories in 500 ml\n\n3. Calculate the calorie-to-volume ratio:\n   - Divide 150 calories by 350 ml\n\n4. Scale up the ratio for 500 ml:\n   - Multiply the calories per ml by 500\n\n5. Round the final result:\n   - Round the answer to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in decimal form with 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical action and the planning strategy, we have successfully calculated the calorie-to-volume ratio of the soda, which is 0.428571428571429 calories per milliliter.\n\nNow, we need to proceed with the next steps of our plan:\n\n1. Scale up this ratio for 500 ml of soda:\n   We need to multiply our calorie-to-volume ratio (0.428571428571429) by 500 ml to find out how many calories are in 500 ml of soda.\n\n2. Round the result to 2 decimal places:\n   After multiplying, we'll need to round the result to two decimal places as specified in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the calculator to multiply 0.428571428571429 by 500. This will give us the total calories in 500 ml of soda before rounding.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be ready to round the result and present our final answer.\n",
