    "observation": "A can of soda contains 150 calories in 350 ml. How many calories are in 500 ml of the same soda? Express your answer in decimal form and round to 2 decimal places.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 350 ml of soda contains 150 calories\n   - We need to find calories in 500 ml of the same soda\n\n2. Determine the approach:\n   - Calculate the calories per ml of soda\n   - Use this ratio to find calories in 500 ml\n\n3. Calculate the calorie-to-volume ratio:\n   - Divide 150 calories by 350 ml\n\n4. Scale up the ratio for 500 ml:\n   - Multiply the calories per ml by 500\n\n5. Round the final result:\n   - Round the answer to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in decimal form with 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we need to start by calculating the calorie-to-volume ratio of the soda. This will allow us to determine how many calories are in each milliliter of soda.\n\nTo do this, we need to divide the given number of calories (150) by the given volume (350 ml). This operation will give us the number of calories per milliliter.\n\nOnce we have this ratio, we can then multiply it by 500 ml to find out how many calories are in 500 ml of the soda.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to use a calculator to perform the following operations:\n\n1. Divide 150 by 350 to get the calories per milliliter.\n2. Multiply the result by 500 to get the total calories in 500 ml.\n\nAfter these calculations, we'll need to round the result to two decimal places as specified in the problem.\n",
