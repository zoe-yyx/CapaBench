    "observation": "A can of soda contains 150 calories in 350 ml. How many calories are in 500 ml of the same soda? Express your answer in decimal form and round to 2 decimal places.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 350 ml of soda contains 150 calories\n   - We need to find calories in 500 ml of the same soda\n\n2. Determine the approach:\n   - Calculate the calories per ml of soda\n   - Use this ratio to find calories in 500 ml\n\n3. Calculate the calorie-to-volume ratio:\n   - Divide 150 calories by 350 ml\n\n4. Scale up the ratio for 500 ml:\n   - Multiply the calories per ml by 500\n\n5. Round the final result:\n   - Round the answer to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in decimal form with 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our planning strategy, we have successfully completed two crucial steps:\n\n1. We calculated the calorie-to-volume ratio: 150 calories / 350 ml = 0.428571428571429 calories/ml\n2. We scaled this ratio up to 500 ml: 0.428571428571429 * 500 = 214.285714285715 calories\n\nNow, we need to focus on the final steps of our plan:\n\n1. Round the result to 2 decimal places:\n   We have 214.285714285715 calories, which needs to be rounded to two decimal places.\n\n2. Present the final answer:\n   Once rounded, we need to express this as our final answer in decimal form.\n\nThe next logical step is to round 214.285714285715 to two decimal places. This can be done using a calculator with a rounding function, or by manually rounding the number.\n\nAfter rounding, we will have our final answer, which should be presented as the solution to the problem: the number of calories in 500 ml of the soda, expressed in decimal form with 2 decimal places.\n",
