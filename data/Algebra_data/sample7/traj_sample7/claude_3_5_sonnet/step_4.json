    "observation": "A can of soda contains 150 calories in 350 ml. How many calories are in 500 ml of the same soda? Express your answer in decimal form and round to 2 decimal places.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 350 ml of soda contains 150 calories\n   - We need to find calories in 500 ml of the same soda\n\n2. Determine the approach:\n   - Calculate the calories per ml of soda\n   - Use this ratio to find calories in 500 ml\n\n3. Calculate the calorie-to-volume ratio:\n   - Divide 150 calories by 350 ml\n\n4. Scale up the ratio for 500 ml:\n   - Multiply the calories per ml by 500\n\n5. Round the final result:\n   - Round the answer to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in decimal form with 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous actions and the planning strategy, we have successfully completed all the necessary calculations and arrived at our final answer. Let's review our progress:\n\n1. We calculated the calorie-to-volume ratio: 150 calories / 350 ml = 0.428571428571429 calories/ml\n2. We scaled this ratio up to 500 ml: 0.428571428571429 * 500 = 214.285714285715 calories\n3. We manually rounded this result to two decimal places: 214.29 calories\n4. We verified this result using the calculator: 214.290000000000\n\nOur reasoning process has led us to the correct final answer that meets all the requirements of the original problem:\n\n- We have calculated the number of calories in 500 ml of soda\n- The answer is expressed in decimal form\n- The answer is rounded to 2 decimal places\n\nAt this point, we have completed all the steps outlined in our planning strategy. The acting agent now has all the necessary information to present the final answer to the problem.\n\nThe next logical step would be for the acting agent to formally state the answer to the original question, ensuring that it's clearly communicated and properly formatted as per the problem requirements.\n",
