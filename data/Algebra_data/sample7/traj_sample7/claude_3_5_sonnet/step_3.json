    "observation": "A can of soda contains 150 calories in 350 ml. How many calories are in 500 ml of the same soda? Express your answer in decimal form and round to 2 decimal places.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 350 ml of soda contains 150 calories\n   - We need to find calories in 500 ml of the same soda\n\n2. Determine the approach:\n   - Calculate the calories per ml of soda\n   - Use this ratio to find calories in 500 ml\n\n3. Calculate the calorie-to-volume ratio:\n   - Divide 150 calories by 350 ml\n\n4. Scale up the ratio for 500 ml:\n   - Multiply the calories per ml by 500\n\n5. Round the final result:\n   - Round the answer to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculations are correct\n   - Ensure the answer is reasonable\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Express the result in decimal form with 2 decimal places\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our planning strategy, we've made significant progress in solving the problem. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We calculated the calorie-to-volume ratio: 150 calories / 350 ml = 0.428571428571429 calories/ml\n2. We scaled this ratio up to 500 ml: 0.428571428571429 * 500 = 214.285714285715 calories\n\nHowever, our last action to round the result to two decimal places using the calculator with \"\\round(214.285714285715, 2)\" didn't provide us with a numerical result. This suggests that the calculator might not recognize this specific rounding function.\n\nGiven this situation, we need to adjust our approach:\n\n1. We should manually round 214.285714285715 to two decimal places.\n2. To do this, we look at the third decimal place:\n   - If it's 5 or greater, we round up.\n   - If it's less than 5, we round down.\n\nIn this case, the third decimal place is 2, so we round down.\n\nTherefore, our rounded result should be 214.29 calories.\n\nThe next step should be to verify this manual rounding by using the calculator to truncate the number to two decimal places, which will confirm our manual calculation.\n",
