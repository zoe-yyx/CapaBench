    "observation": "Paula bought an equal number of apples and bananas for $12. If each apple costs $0.50 and each banana costs $0.25, how many bananas did she buy?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Math Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total cost: $12\n   - Cost per apple: $0.50\n   - Cost per banana: $0.25\n   - Equal number of apples and bananas\n\n2. Set up an equation:\n   - Let x be the number of apples (and bananas)\n   - Express the total cost in terms of x\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify the equation\n   - Isolate x to find the number of apples/bananas\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the calculated number satisfies all conditions\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - The number of bananas Paula bought\n\nCalculation steps:\n1. Set up the equation: 0.50x + 0.25x = 12\n2. Simplify: 0.75x = 12\n3. Solve for x: x = 12 \u00f7 0.75\n4. Calculate x using a calculator\n5. Verify that the result is a whole number and satisfies the conditions\n6. Conclude that x is the number of bananas Paula bought\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds of calculation and verification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the equation that represents the problem. We know that Paula bought an equal number of apples and bananas, so we can use 'x' to represent this number for both fruits.\n\nThe equation should be:\n\n0.50x + 0.25x = 12\n\nThis equation represents:\n- 0.50x for the cost of apples (x apples at $0.50 each)\n- 0.25x for the cost of bananas (x bananas at $0.25 each)\n- The total sum equals $12\n\nThe next step should be to simplify this equation by combining like terms. The acting agent should add 0.50x and 0.25x to get 0.75x on the left side of the equation.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to simplify the equation to:\n\n0.75x = 12\n\nThis simplified equation will set us up for the next step in solving for x, which represents the number of bananas (and apples) Paula bought.\n",
