    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with complex numbers\n   - We need to add two complex numbers: (-1 + i) and (2 - i)\n\n2. Recall the rules for adding complex numbers:\n   - Add the real parts together\n   - Add the imaginary parts together\n\n3. Identify the components:\n   - For (-1 + i): Real part = -1, Imaginary part = 1i\n   - For (2 - i): Real part = 2, Imaginary part = -1i\n\n4. Perform the addition:\n   - Add the real parts: (-1) + 2\n   - Add the imaginary parts: i + (-i)\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms for the real and imaginary parts\n\n6. Present the final answer in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the coefficient of i\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have successfully calculated the real part of the result: (-1) + 2 = 1\n\n2. Now we need to focus on the imaginary part of the complex numbers.\n\n3. From our initial breakdown, we have:\n   - For (-1 + i): Imaginary part = 1i\n   - For (2 - i): Imaginary part = -1i\n\n4. We need to add these imaginary parts: 1i + (-1i)\n\n5. This addition of imaginary parts can be simplified algebraically:\n   1i + (-1i) = (1 - 1)i = 0i\n\n6. After this calculation, we will have both the real and imaginary parts of our result.\n\n7. The final step will be to combine these parts into the standard form a + bi.\n\nThe acting agent should now use the calculator to verify that 1i + (-1i) = 0i, although this is a straightforward algebraic simplification that doesn't necessarily require numerical calculation.\n",
