Recall the rules for adding complex numbers:\n   - Add the real parts together\n   - Add the imaginary parts together\n\n3. Identify the components:\n   - For (-1 + i): Real part = -1, Imaginary part = 1i\n   - For (2 - i): Real part = 2, Imaginary part = -1i\n\n4. Perform the addition:\n   - Add the real parts: (-1) + 2\n   - Add the imaginary parts: i + (-i)\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms for the real and imaginary parts\n\n6. Present the final answer in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the coefficient of i\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",

Let's break down the components:\n   - For (-1 + i): Real part = -1, Imaginary part = 1i\n   - For (2 - i): Real part = 2, Imaginary part = -1i\n\n4. Now, we should add the real parts:\n   (-1) + 2\n\n5. Then, we should add the imaginary parts:\n   1i + (-1i)\n\n6. After performing these additions, we'll need to combine the results into the standard form a + bi.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these additions and then combine the results.\n",
