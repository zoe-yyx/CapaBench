    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are dealing with complex numbers\n   - We need to add two complex numbers: (-1 + i) and (2 - i)\n\n2. Recall the rules for adding complex numbers:\n   - Add the real parts together\n   - Add the imaginary parts together\n\n3. Identify the components:\n   - For (-1 + i): Real part = -1, Imaginary part = 1i\n   - For (2 - i): Real part = 2, Imaginary part = -1i\n\n4. Perform the addition:\n   - Add the real parts: (-1) + 2\n   - Add the imaginary parts: i + (-i)\n\n5. Simplify the result:\n   - Combine like terms for the real and imaginary parts\n\n6. Present the final answer in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the coefficient of i\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have successfully calculated both parts of our complex number addition:\n   - Real part: (-1) + 2 = 1\n   - Imaginary part: 1i + (-1i) = 0i\n\n2. Now we need to combine these results into the standard form a + bi.\n\n3. Our result is:\n   1 + 0i\n\n4. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, we can simplify 0i to just 0.\n\n5. Therefore, our final answer is simply 1, as the imaginary part has cancelled out.\n\n6. To ensure accuracy, we should verify that 1 is indeed the correct solution to (-1 + i) + (2 - i).\n\nThe acting agent should now present the final answer as 1, and if possible, verify this result by substituting it back into the original equation.\n",
