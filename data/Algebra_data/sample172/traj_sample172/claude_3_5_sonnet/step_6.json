    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find values of x where |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - The answer should be in interval notation\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 < 0\n   - Case 3: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 < 0\n\n3. Solve inequalities for each case:\n   - For each case, set up the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - Simplify and solve for x in each case\n\n4. Determine the critical points:\n   - x = -2 (where x + 2 = 0)\n   - x = 3 (where x - 3 = 0)\n\n5. Combine and analyze the results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases\n   - Determine the final range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the answer in interval notation:\n   - Write the final solution using proper interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a few points within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\nThis plan should guide the following agents to solve the problem systematically and efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our comprehensive analysis and verification process, we can now confidently formulate our final solution. Let's summarize our findings:\n\n1. We found that the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8 is satisfied for x in the interval (-3.5, 4.5).\n\n2. We verified three critical points:\n   - For x = -3.5: The result was exactly 8, confirming it's not included in our solution.\n   - For x = 0: The result was 5, which is less than 8, confirming it's within our solution set.\n   - For x = 4.5: The result was exactly 8, confirming it's not included in our solution.\n\n3. We've analyzed all regions and verified the endpoints.\n\nGiven these results, we can conclude that the solution to our original problem is the open interval (-3.5, 4.5).\n\nThe next step is to express this solution in proper interval notation. Since both endpoints yield exactly 8 when plugged into our original inequality, they are not included in the solution set. Therefore, we use parentheses to denote an open interval.\n\nOur final answer in interval notation is: (-3.5, 4.5)\n\nThis completes our problem-solving process. We have successfully found the range of values for x where |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8 and expressed it in interval notation.\n\nThe acting agent should now present this final answer as the solution to the original problem.\n",
