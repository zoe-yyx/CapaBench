    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find values of x where |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - The answer should be in interval notation\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 < 0\n   - Case 3: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 < 0\n\n3. Solve inequalities for each case:\n   - For each case, set up the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - Simplify and solve for x in each case\n\n4. Determine the critical points:\n   - x = -2 (where x + 2 = 0)\n   - x = 3 (where x - 3 = 0)\n\n5. Combine and analyze the results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases\n   - Determine the final range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the answer in interval notation:\n   - Write the final solution using proper interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a few points within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\nThis plan should guide the following agents to solve the problem systematically and efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, our first step should be to break down the absolute value expressions and consider the different cases. We need to identify the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute value brackets change sign. These critical points are:\n\n1. x = -2 (where x + 2 = 0)\n2. x = 3 (where x - 3 = 0)\n\nThese points divide the real number line into three regions:\n\n1. x < -2\n2. -2 \u2264 x < 3\n3. x \u2265 3\n\nFor each of these regions, the absolute value expressions will behave differently. We should analyze each region separately to determine where the sum |x + 2| + |x - 3| is less than 8.\n\nThe next logical step would be to set up the inequalities for each region and solve them. We should start with the middle region (-2 \u2264 x < 3) as it's often the most straightforward to analyze.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to focus on setting up and solving the inequality for the region -2 \u2264 x < 3.\n",
