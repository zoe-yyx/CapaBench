    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find values of x where |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - The answer should be in interval notation\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 < 0\n   - Case 3: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 < 0\n\n3. Solve inequalities for each case:\n   - For each case, set up the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - Simplify and solve for x in each case\n\n4. Determine the critical points:\n   - x = -2 (where x + 2 = 0)\n   - x = 3 (where x - 3 = 0)\n\n5. Combine and analyze the results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases\n   - Determine the final range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the answer in interval notation:\n   - Write the final solution using proper interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a few points within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\nThis plan should guide the following agents to solve the problem systematically and efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous action and the planning strategy, we have successfully set up the inequality for the middle region (-2 \u2264 x < 3). Now, we need to solve this inequality to find the range of x values that satisfy it within this region.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. We have the inequality: (x + 2) + (-(x - 3)) < 8\n2. Simplify the left side of the inequality:\n   (x + 2) + (-x + 3) < 8\n   x + 2 - x + 3 < 8\n   5 < 8\n\nThis simplification shows that the inequality is always true for all x values in the region -2 \u2264 x < 3. This is a significant finding as it means this entire region is part of our solution.\n\nNext, we should analyze the remaining two regions:\n\n1. For x < -2:\n   We need to set up and solve |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8, where both terms are negative inside the absolute value.\n\n2. For x \u2265 3:\n   We need to set up and solve |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8, where both terms are positive inside the absolute value.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to set up and solve the inequality for the region x < -2 next. This will help us determine if there are any additional x values that satisfy the original inequality.\n",
