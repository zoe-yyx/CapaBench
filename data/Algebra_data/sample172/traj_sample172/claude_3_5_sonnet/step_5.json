    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find values of x where |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - The answer should be in interval notation\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 < 0\n   - Case 3: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 < 0\n\n3. Solve inequalities for each case:\n   - For each case, set up the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - Simplify and solve for x in each case\n\n4. Determine the critical points:\n   - x = -2 (where x + 2 = 0)\n   - x = 3 (where x - 3 = 0)\n\n5. Combine and analyze the results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases\n   - Determine the final range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the answer in interval notation:\n   - Write the final solution using proper interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a few points within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\nThis plan should guide the following agents to solve the problem systematically and efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the verification steps we've taken, let's analyze the results:\n\n1. For x = -3.5 (left endpoint): |-3.5 + 2| + |-3.5 - 3| = 8\n   This confirms that -3.5 is not included in our solution set, as the sum equals 8, not less than 8.\n\n2. For x = 0 (middle point): |0 + 2| + |0 - 3| = 5\n   This verifies that 0 is indeed within our solution set, as 5 is less than 8.\n\n3. We still need to verify the right endpoint (x = 4.5).\n\nOur reasoning leads us to the following next steps:\n\n1. Verify the solution for x = 4.5, which is our right endpoint.\n2. After this final verification, we can confidently express our answer in interval notation.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the calculator for the last verification:\n\nCalculate |4.5 + 2| + |4.5 - 3| for x = 4.5\n\nThis final calculation will complete our verification process and allow us to express our solution with certainty. If the result is exactly 8 or greater, we'll know that 4.5 is not included in our solution set. If it's less than 8, it will be included.\n",
