    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find values of x where |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - The answer should be in interval notation\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 < 0\n   - Case 3: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 < 0\n\n3. Solve inequalities for each case:\n   - For each case, set up the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - Simplify and solve for x in each case\n\n4. Determine the critical points:\n   - x = -2 (where x + 2 = 0)\n   - x = 3 (where x - 3 = 0)\n\n5. Combine and analyze the results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases\n   - Determine the final range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the answer in interval notation:\n   - Write the final solution using proper interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a few points within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\nThis plan should guide the following agents to solve the problem systematically and efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous actions and our planning strategy, we have made significant progress. We've analyzed the middle region (-2 \u2264 x < 3) and found that it entirely satisfies our inequality. We've also set up and partially solved the inequality for the region x < -2.\n\nLet's continue our reasoning:\n\n1. For x < -2:\n   We have the inequality -(x + 2) - (x - 3) < 8\n   Simplifying this, we got x > -3.5\n\n   This means that for the region x < -2, the original inequality is satisfied when -3.5 < x < -2.\n\n2. We still need to analyze the region x \u2265 3:\n   For this region, both terms inside the absolute value brackets are positive, so we don't need to change their signs.\n\n   We need to set up and solve: (x + 2) + (x - 3) < 8\n\nOur next step should be to solve this inequality for x \u2265 3. This will give us the upper bound of our solution range.\n\nAfter solving this, we'll have analyzed all regions and can combine our results to express the final solution in interval notation.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the calculator to solve (x + 2) + (x - 3) < 8 for x \u2265 3.\n",
