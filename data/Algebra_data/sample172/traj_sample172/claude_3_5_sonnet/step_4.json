    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find values of x where |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - The answer should be in interval notation\n\n2. Break down the absolute value expressions:\n   - Consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute value brackets\n   - Case 1: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 2: x + 2 \u2265 0 and x - 3 < 0\n   - Case 3: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 \u2265 0\n   - Case 4: x + 2 < 0 and x - 3 < 0\n\n3. Solve inequalities for each case:\n   - For each case, set up the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8\n   - Simplify and solve for x in each case\n\n4. Determine the critical points:\n   - x = -2 (where x + 2 = 0)\n   - x = 3 (where x - 3 = 0)\n\n5. Combine and analyze the results:\n   - Identify the overlapping intervals from all cases\n   - Determine the final range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the answer in interval notation:\n   - Write the final solution using proper interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a few points within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\nThis plan should guide the following agents to solve the problem systematically and efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous actions and our progress, we have successfully solved and verified most parts of our solution. Let's analyze our current position:\n\n1. We have found that the inequality |x + 2| + |x - 3| < 8 is satisfied for x in the interval (-3.5, 4.5).\n\n2. We have verified the left endpoint (x = -3.5), which yielded exactly 8, confirming it's not included in our solution.\n\n3. We still need to verify the middle point (x = 0) and the right endpoint (x = 4.5) to ensure our solution is completely correct.\n\nOur next steps should be:\n\n1. Verify the solution for x = 0, which is a point within our interval.\n2. Verify the solution for x = 4.5, which is our right endpoint.\n3. After verification, express the final answer in interval notation.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the calculator to check these remaining points:\n\n1. Calculate |0 + 2| + |0 - 3| for x = 0\n2. Calculate |4.5 + 2| + |4.5 - 3| for x = 4.5\n\nThese calculations will complete our verification process and allow us to confidently express our final answer in interval notation.\n",
