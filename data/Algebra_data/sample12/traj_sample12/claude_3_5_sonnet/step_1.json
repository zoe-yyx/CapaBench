Calculate the value of $a$:\n   - Evaluate $2^3$\n\n3. Express $b$ in terms of $a$:\n   - Substitute the value of $a$ into $b = a^4$\n\n4. Simplify the expression for $b$:\n   - Use the laws of exponents to expand $b$\n\n5. Express the final result in the form $2^n$:\n   - Simplify the exponents\n   - Identify the value of $n$\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the expression matches the form $2^n$\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of $b$ in terms of $2^n$\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated $a = 2^3 = 8$, we can proceed to express $b$ in terms of $a$. \n\nWe know that $b = a^4$, so let's substitute the value of $a$ we just calculated:\n\n$b = (2^3)^4$\n\nThis expression can be simplified using the law of exponents $(x^m)^n = x^{mn}$. In this case, we have $(2^3)^4$, which can be rewritten as $2^{3 \\times 4}$.\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate $3 \\times 4$ to simplify the exponent. This will give us $b$ expressed directly in terms of $2^n$, which is our goal.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 3 by 4 to determine the final exponent.\n",
