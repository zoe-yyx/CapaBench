Calculate the value of $a$:\n   - Evaluate $2^3$\n\n3. Express $b$ in terms of $a$:\n   - Substitute the value of $a$ into $b = a^4$\n\n4. Simplify the expression for $b$:\n   - Use the laws of exponents to expand $b$\n\n5. Express the final result in the form $2^n$:\n   - Simplify the exponents\n   - Identify the value of $n$\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the expression matches the form $2^n$\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of $b$ in terms of $2^n$\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe previous steps in solving this problem were correct up until the final answer presentation. We correctly derived that b = 2^12. However, the question specifically asks for the value of b in terms of 2^n, which means we need to identify and state the value of n.\n\nGiven:\n- a = 2^3\n- b = a^4\n- We derived: b = (2^3)^4 = 2^(3*4) = 2^12\n\nTherefore, in the expression b = 2^n, n = 12.\n\nThe acting agent should now simply state that the value of n is 12, without rewriting the entire equation. This directly answers the question of expressing b in terms of 2^n.\n\nNo further calculations are needed. The acting agent should present 12 as the final answer, representing the value of n in the expression 2^n that equals b.\n",
