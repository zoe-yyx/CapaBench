    "observation": "Given a line segment with endpoints $(2, -3)$ and $(8, 5)$. What is the midpoint of this segment?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the concept:\n   - Recall the midpoint formula for a line segment.\n\n2. Identify given information:\n   - Endpoint 1: (2, -3)\n   - Endpoint 2: (8, 5)\n\n3. Apply the midpoint formula:\n   - Use the formula: Midpoint = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n   - Where (x1, y1) is the first endpoint and (x2, y2) is the second endpoint\n\n4. Calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint:\n   - x = (2 + 8) / 2\n\n5. Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint:\n   - y = (-3 + 5) / 2\n\n6. Combine the results:\n   - Express the midpoint as an ordered pair (x, y)\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the midpoint is indeed halfway between the two endpoints\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 2-3 rounds of calculation and verification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we've successfully calculated the x-coordinate of the midpoint. The x-coordinate is 5, which is correct as (2 + 8) / 2 = 5.\n\nNow, we need to focus on calculating the y-coordinate of the midpoint. According to our plan, we need to calculate (-3 + 5) / 2.\n\nThe next logical step is to guide the acting agent to use the calculator to perform this calculation. This will give us the y-coordinate of the midpoint.\n\nAfter obtaining the y-coordinate, we'll have both coordinates necessary to express the midpoint as an ordered pair (x, y).\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to calculate (-3 + 5) / 2 using the calculator.\n",
