    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given expression:\n   - We have $(2z)^4$ in the numerator and $z^2$ in the denominator\n   - We're told that $z = 3$\n\n2. Simplify the numerator:\n   - Expand $(2z)^4$\n   - This equals $16z^4$\n\n3. Simplify the fraction:\n   - We now have $\\frac{16z^4}{z^2}$\n   - Divide both numerator and denominator by $z^2$\n   - This results in $16z^2$\n\n4. Substitute the value of z:\n   - Replace $z$ with 3 in the simplified expression\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Compute $16 * 3^2$\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Double-check the calculation\n   - Ensure all steps were followed correctly\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward algebraic simplification and numerical calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by simplifying the numerator of the expression. The numerator is $(2z)^4$. Let's break this down:\n\n1. $(2z)^4$ means $(2z) * (2z) * (2z) * (2z)$\n2. This can be rewritten as $2^4 * z^4$\n3. $2^4 = 16$\n\nSo, $(2z)^4$ simplifies to $16z^4$. \n\nThe next logical step would be to express the entire fraction with this simplified numerator. This will give us:\n\n$\\frac{16z^4}{z^2}$\n\nThis reasoning sets up the acting agent to perform the simplification of $(2z)^4$ to $16z^4$ and rewrite the fraction accordingly.\n",
