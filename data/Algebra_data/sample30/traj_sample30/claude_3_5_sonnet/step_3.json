    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given expression:\n   - We have $(2z)^4$ in the numerator and $z^2$ in the denominator\n   - We're told that $z = 3$\n\n2. Simplify the numerator:\n   - Expand $(2z)^4$\n   - This equals $16z^4$\n\n3. Simplify the fraction:\n   - We now have $\\frac{16z^4}{z^2}$\n   - Divide both numerator and denominator by $z^2$\n   - This results in $16z^2$\n\n4. Substitute the value of z:\n   - Replace $z$ with 3 in the simplified expression\n\n5. Calculate the final result:\n   - Compute $16 * 3^2$\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Double-check the calculation\n   - Ensure all steps were followed correctly\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward algebraic simplification and numerical calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully simplified the expression and substituted the value of z. The current state of our expression is 16(3)^2. The next logical step is to calculate this value to get our final result. We need to:\n\n1. Calculate 3^2, which is 9\n2. Multiply 16 by 9\n\nThis calculation will give us the final simplified value of the expression. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this multiplication accurately.\n",
