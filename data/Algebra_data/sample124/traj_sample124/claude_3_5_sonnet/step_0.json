Understand the problem:\n   - We need to evaluate the expression $\\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor + 3 \\cdot \\lfloor 0.8 \\cdot 2.5 \\rfloor$\n   - The expression involves floor functions and multiplication\n\n2. Break down the problem:\n   a) Evaluate $\\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor$\n   b) Calculate $0.8 \\cdot 2.5$\n   c) Evaluate $\\lfloor 0.8 \\cdot 2.5 \\rfloor$\n   d) Multiply the result from step c by 3\n   e) Add the results from steps a and d\n\n3. Recall floor function properties:\n   - The floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ gives the largest integer less than or equal to x\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Use a calculator for precise decimal calculations\n   - Apply the floor function manually or use a calculator with a floor function\n\n5. Combine results:\n   - Add the final values from steps 2a and 2d\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the result is a whole number\n   - Ensure all steps have been followed correctly\n\n7.
