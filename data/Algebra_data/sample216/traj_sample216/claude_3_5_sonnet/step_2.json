Understand the given information:\n   - Original function: f(x) = 5 / (x-2)\n   - New function: y = (1/2) * f(2x+1)\n   - Point (4,a) lies on the graph of the new function\n\n2. Transform the original function into the new function:\n   - Replace x with (2x+1) in the original function\n   - Multiply the result by 1/2\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   - Use the point (4,a) in the new function equation\n   - Replace x with 4 and y with a\n\n4. Solve the equation for a:\n   - Simplify the equation\n   - Isolate 'a' on one side\n\n5. Calculate the final value of a:\n   - Use a calculator if needed for any complex arithmetic\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the found value of 'a' satisfies the original conditions\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of 'a' clearly\n",

Converting a recurring decimal to a fraction usually involves setting up an equation and solving it. However, in this case, we can recognize that this decimal is likely the result of a division with 7 in the denominator.\n\n5. Our next step should be to verify if this decimal can be expressed as a simple fraction, potentially 5/14.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on verifying if 0.357142857142857 can be expressed as the fraction 5/14, which would be a more precise and elegant representation of our solution.\n",
