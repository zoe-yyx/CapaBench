    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to follow the first few steps of our planning strategy. Let's start by transforming the original function into the new function as described in step 2 of our plan.\n\n1. We start with f(x) = 5 / (x-2)\n2. In the new function, we replace x with (2x+1):\n   f(2x+1) = 5 / ((2x+1) - 2)\n3. Simplify the denominator:\n   f(2x+1) = 5 / (2x-1)\n4. Now, multiply this by 1/2 as per the new function definition:\n   y = (1/2) * f(2x+1) = (1/2) * 5 / (2x-1) = 5 / (2(2x-1))\n\nThis gives us the equation of the new function: y = 5 / (4x-2)\n\nNow that we have the equation of the new function, we can move on to setting up an equation using the point (4,a) as described in step 3 of our plan. This will allow us to solve for the value of 'a'.\n\nThe next logical step would be to substitute x=4 and y=a into this equation and solve for 'a'.\n",
