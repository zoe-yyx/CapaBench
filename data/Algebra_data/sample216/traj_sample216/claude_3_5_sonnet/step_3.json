Transform the original function into the new function:\n   - Replace x with (2x+1) in the original function\n   - Multiply the result by 1/2\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   - Use the point (4,a) in the new function equation\n   - Replace x with 4 and y with a\n\n4. Solve the equation for a:\n   - Simplify the equation\n   - Isolate 'a' on one side\n\n5. Calculate the final value of a:\n   - Use a calculator if needed for any complex arithmetic\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the found value of 'a' satisfies the original conditions\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of 'a' clearly\n",

We correctly substituted the point (4,a) into this new function, resulting in the equation a = 5 / (2(2(4)-1)).\n\n3. The calculation of this equation gave us a \u2248 0.357142857142857.\n\n4. We've verified that this decimal is indeed equal to the fraction 5/14.\n\nGiven these steps and verifications, we can conclude that:\n\na = 5/14\n\nThis fraction is the exact and simplified form of our solution. It's more precise than the decimal representation and easier to work with in further mathematical operations if needed.\n\nThe next logical step would be to formally present this as our final answer to the original problem. We should state clearly that given the function f(x) = 5/(x-2) and the point (4,a) on the graph of y = (1/2)f(2x+1), we have found that a = 5/14.\n\nTo further solidify our solution, it might be beneficial to verify this result by substituting it back into the original problem statement.
