Recall Vieta's formulas for quadratic equations:\n   - Sum of roots = -b/a (where a and b are coefficients of x^2 and x respectively)\n   - Product of roots = c/a (where c is the constant term)\n\n3. Apply Vieta's formulas to our equation:\n   - Sum of roots = p (since -(-p)/1 = p)\n   - Product of roots = 36 (since 36/1 = 36)\n\n4. Set up an equation based on the given condition:\n   - Sum of roots = 2 \u00d7 Product of roots\n   - p = 2 \u00d7 36\n\n5. Solve the equation for p:\n   - p = 72\n\n6.
