    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Equation:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Equation: x^2 - px + 36 = 0\n   - Sum of roots is twice the product of roots\n\n2. Recall Vieta's formulas for quadratic equations:\n   - Sum of roots = -b/a (where a and b are coefficients of x^2 and x respectively)\n   - Product of roots = c/a (where c is the constant term)\n\n3. Apply Vieta's formulas to our equation:\n   - Sum of roots = p (since -(-p)/1 = p)\n   - Product of roots = 36 (since 36/1 = 36)\n\n4. Set up an equation based on the given condition:\n   - Sum of roots = 2 \u00d7 Product of roots\n   - p = 2 \u00d7 36\n\n5. Solve the equation for p:\n   - p = 72\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if p = 72 satisfies the original equation and condition\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The value of p is 72\n\nNote: This problem can be solved in a few steps without needing complex calculations or external resources. The acting agent should be able to perform the necessary arithmetic operations without a calculator.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result from the acting agent, we have confirmed that p = 72. Now, we need to verify if this value satisfies the original equation and condition. Let's guide the acting agent through this verification process:\n\n1. Substitute p = 72 into the original equation: x^2 - 72x + 36 = 0\n\n2. Check if the sum of roots is indeed twice the product of roots:\n   - Sum of roots = p = 72\n   - Product of roots = 36 (given in the original equation)\n   - Verify: Is 72 equal to 2 \u00d7 36?\n\n3. Use Vieta's formulas to double-check:\n   - Sum of roots = -b/a = 72 (matches our p value)\n   - Product of roots = c/a = 36\n\nThis verification will confirm that our solution p = 72 is correct and satisfies all given conditions. The acting agent should perform these verification steps to complete the problem-solving process.\n",
