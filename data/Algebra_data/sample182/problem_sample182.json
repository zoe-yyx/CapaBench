    "problem": "Given the equation $x^2 - px + 36 = 0$, the sum of the roots is twice the product of the roots. Find the value of $p$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $p$, and the product of the roots is $36$. According to the given condition, $p = 2 \\times 36 = 72$. Therefore, the value of $p$ is $\\boxed{72}$.",
