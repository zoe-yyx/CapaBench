    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the function:\n   - Analyze the given function g(x) = x^2 / (x-3)\n\n2. Identify the condition for undefined function:\n   - A fraction is undefined when its denominator equals zero\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   - Set the denominator equal to zero: x - 3 = 0\n\n4. Solve the equation:\n   - Isolate x to find the value that makes the function undefined\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the solution is an integer\n   - Confirm that this value indeed makes g(x) undefined\n\n6. Final answer:\n   - State the integer value of x for which g(x) is undefined\n\n7. Optional: Discuss domain:\n   - Briefly explain the domain of the function g(x)\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within a few steps, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the previous action, we have solved the equation x - 3 = 0 for x. The solution to this equation is x = 3.\n\nNow, let's analyze this result:\n\n1. We found that when x = 3, the denominator of the function g(x) = x^2 / (x-3) becomes zero.\n\n2. When the denominator of a fraction is zero, the fraction is undefined.\n\n3. The question asks for which integer x the function g(x) is undefined.\n\n4. We have found that x = 3 makes the denominator zero, and 3 is indeed an integer.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning leads us to conclude that g(x) is undefined when x = 3. \n\nThe next logical step would be to verify this result by plugging x = 3 into the original function to confirm that it indeed leads to an undefined result (division by zero).\n",
