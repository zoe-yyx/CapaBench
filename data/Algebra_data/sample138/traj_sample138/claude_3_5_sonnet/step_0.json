Solve the equation:\n   - Isolate x to find the value that makes the function undefined\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the solution is an integer\n   - Confirm that this value indeed makes g(x) undefined\n\n6. Final answer:\n   - State the integer value of x for which g(x) is undefined\n\n7. Optional: Discuss domain:\n   - Briefly explain the domain of the function g(x)\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within a few steps, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo determine for which integer x the function g(x) = x^2 / (x-3) is undefined, we need to focus on the denominator of the fraction. A fraction becomes undefined when its denominator equals zero. Therefore, we should:\n\n1. Set up the equation: x - 3 = 0\n2. Solve this equation to find the value of x that makes the denominator zero\n\nThis approach directly addresses steps 2 and 3 of our planning strategy. By solving this equation, we'll identify the critical value of x that makes g(x) undefined. \n\nThe next logical step for the acting agent would be to solve this simple linear equation: x - 3 = 0.\n",
