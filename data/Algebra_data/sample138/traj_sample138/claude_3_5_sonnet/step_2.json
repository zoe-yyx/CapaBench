    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the function:\n   - Analyze the given function g(x) = x^2 / (x-3)\n\n2. Identify the condition for undefined function:\n   - A fraction is undefined when its denominator equals zero\n\n3. Set up an equation:\n   - Set the denominator equal to zero: x - 3 = 0\n\n4. Solve the equation:\n   - Isolate x to find the value that makes the function undefined\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the solution is an integer\n   - Confirm that this value indeed makes g(x) undefined\n\n6. Final answer:\n   - State the integer value of x for which g(x) is undefined\n\n7. Optional: Discuss domain:\n   - Briefly explain the domain of the function g(x)\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct answer within a few steps, well under the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe historical actions show that we have:\n1. Solved the equation x - 3 = 0, finding x = 3.\n2. Attempted to calculate g(3) = 3^2 / (3-3) using a calculator, which resulted in \"zoo\".\n\nLet's analyze this:\n1. The \"zoo\" result from the calculator is likely an error code indicating an undefined or indeterminate form.\n2. This confirms our algebraic reasoning that g(x) is undefined when x = 3.\n3. We have successfully verified that:\n   a) x = 3 makes the denominator zero\n   b) x = 3 is an integer\n   c) Attempting to calculate g(3) results in an undefined value\n\nGiven this confirmation, we can conclude that our solution is correct. The next logical step would be to formulate the final answer as per the original question.\n\nTo ensure completeness, we might also want to briefly discuss the domain of the function g(x), as mentioned in the planning strategy. This would involve stating that g(x) is defined for all real numbers except 3.\n",
