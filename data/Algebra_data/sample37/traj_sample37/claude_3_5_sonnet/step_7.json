Use the first two fractions to find x:\n   - Set up the equation: 3/8 = x/24\n   - Cross-multiply to solve for x\n\n3. Use the first and third fractions to find y:\n   - Set up the equation: 3/8 = 72/y\n   - Cross-multiply to solve for y\n\n4. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Add the values of x and y found in steps 2 and 3\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if all three fractions are indeed equal using the found values\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. Each step involves simple arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
