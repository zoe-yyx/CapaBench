    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - We have three equal fractions: 3/8 = x/24 = 72/y\n   - Our goal is to find x and y, then calculate x + y\n\n2. Use the first two fractions to find x:\n   - Set up the equation: 3/8 = x/24\n   - Cross-multiply to solve for x\n\n3. Use the first and third fractions to find y:\n   - Set up the equation: 3/8 = 72/y\n   - Cross-multiply to solve for y\n\n4. Calculate the final answer:\n   - Add the values of x and y found in steps 2 and 3\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if all three fractions are indeed equal using the found values\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. Each step involves simple arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our complete verification process, we have confirmed that all three fractions in the original equation are indeed equal:\n\n3/8 = 9/24 = 72/192 = 0.375\n\nThis verification proves that our solution is correct. Let's summarize our findings:\n\n1. We found x = 9\n2. We found y = 192\n3. We calculated x + y = 9 + 192 = 201\n\nWe have successfully solved the original problem: If 3/8 = x/24 = 72/y, what is x + y?\n\nThe answer is x + y = 201.\n\nAt this point, we have completed all steps of our problem-solving strategy:\n1.
