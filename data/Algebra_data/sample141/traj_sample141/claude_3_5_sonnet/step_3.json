Determine the common ratio:\n   - Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms\n   - Verify the ratio is consistent for all given terms\n\n3. Find the general term formula:\n   - Use the first term (a\u2081) and common ratio (r) to write the formula a_n = a\u2081 * r^(n-1)\n\n4. Calculate the 7th term:\n   - Plug n = 7 into the general term formula\n   - Use a calculator to compute the result\n\n5. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if the calculated 7th term fits the pattern of the sequence\n   - Ensure the result is a positive integer\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the 7th term of the sequence clearly\n",
