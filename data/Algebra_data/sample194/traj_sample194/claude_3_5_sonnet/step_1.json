    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - This is a geometric sequence\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 32\n   - 6th term (a6) = 4\n   - Need to find sum of first 8 terms\n\n2. Determine the common ratio (r):\n   - Use the relationship between 3rd and 6th terms\n   - a6 = a3 * r^3\n   - 4 = 32 * r^3\n   - Solve for r\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use a3 = 32 and the found r\n   - a3 = a1 * r^2\n   - Solve for a1\n\n4. Verify the sequence:\n   - Calculate terms 1 through 8 using a1 and r\n   - Confirm 3rd term is 32 and 6th term is 4\n\n5. Apply the sum formula for geometric sequences:\n   - Use S_n = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n = 8\n   - Plug in values for a1, r, and n = 8\n   - Calculate the sum\n\n6. Double-check the result:\n   - Manually sum the 8 terms calculated earlier\n   - Confirm it matches the formula result\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the first 8 terms\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the common ratio r = (1/8)^(1/3), we can proceed to find the first term (a1) of the geometric sequence. We'll use the relationship between a1 and a3, since we know that a3 = 32.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is r times the previous term. So:\n\na3 = a1 * r^2\n32 = a1 * ((1/8)^(1/3))^2\n\nTo solve for a1, we need to divide both sides by ((1/8)^(1/3))^2:\n\na1 = 32 / ((1/8)^(1/3))^2\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute this value. They should:\n\n1. Calculate ((1/8)^(1/3))^2\n2. Divide 32 by the result of step 1\n\nThis will give us the value of a1, which is crucial for calculating the sum of the sequence later.\n\nAfter finding a1, we can verify the sequence by calculating the first 8 terms using the formula an = a1 * r^(n-1), where n is the term number. This will also help us confirm that our calculations for r and a1 are correct.\n",
