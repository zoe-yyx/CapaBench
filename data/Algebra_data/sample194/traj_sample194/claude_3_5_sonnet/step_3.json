    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - This is a geometric sequence\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 32\n   - 6th term (a6) = 4\n   - Need to find sum of first 8 terms\n\n2. Determine the common ratio (r):\n   - Use the relationship between 3rd and 6th terms\n   - a6 = a3 * r^3\n   - 4 = 32 * r^3\n   - Solve for r\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use a3 = 32 and the found r\n   - a3 = a1 * r^2\n   - Solve for a1\n\n4. Verify the sequence:\n   - Calculate terms 1 through 8 using a1 and r\n   - Confirm 3rd term is 32 and 6th term is 4\n\n5. Apply the sum formula for geometric sequences:\n   - Use S_n = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n = 8\n   - Plug in values for a1, r, and n = 8\n   - Calculate the sum\n\n6. Double-check the result:\n   - Manually sum the 8 terms calculated earlier\n   - Confirm it matches the formula result\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the first 8 terms\n",
