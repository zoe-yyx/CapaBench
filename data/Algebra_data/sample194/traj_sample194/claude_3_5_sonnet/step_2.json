    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - This is a geometric sequence\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 32\n   - 6th term (a6) = 4\n   - Need to find sum of first 8 terms\n\n2. Determine the common ratio (r):\n   - Use the relationship between 3rd and 6th terms\n   - a6 = a3 * r^3\n   - 4 = 32 * r^3\n   - Solve for r\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use a3 = 32 and the found r\n   - a3 = a1 * r^2\n   - Solve for a1\n\n4. Verify the sequence:\n   - Calculate terms 1 through 8 using a1 and r\n   - Confirm 3rd term is 32 and 6th term is 4\n\n5. Apply the sum formula for geometric sequences:\n   - Use S_n = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n = 8\n   - Plug in values for a1, r, and n = 8\n   - Calculate the sum\n\n6. Double-check the result:\n   - Manually sum the 8 terms calculated earlier\n   - Confirm it matches the formula result\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the first 8 terms\n",

We have a1 = 32 / ((1/8)^(1/3))^2\n2. For each subsequent term, we multiply by r = (1/8)^(1/3)\n\nWe should ask the acting agent to:\n\n1. Calculate the exact value of a1 (which should be 128)\n2. Calculate the first 8 terms of the sequence using the formula an = a1 * r^(n-1)\n3. Verify that the 3rd term is indeed 32 and the 6th term is 4\n\nThis will confirm our calculations so far and prepare us for the final step of summing the series.\n\nAfter verifying the sequence, we can move on to applying the sum formula for geometric sequences:\n\nS_n = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n = 8\n\nWe'll need these calculations to solve the problem.\n",
