    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - This is a geometric sequence\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 32\n   - 6th term (a6) = 4\n   - Need to find sum of first 8 terms\n\n2. Determine the common ratio (r):\n   - Use the relationship between 3rd and 6th terms\n   - a6 = a3 * r^3\n   - 4 = 32 * r^3\n   - Solve for r\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use a3 = 32 and the found r\n   - a3 = a1 * r^2\n   - Solve for a1\n\n4. Verify the sequence:\n   - Calculate terms 1 through 8 using a1 and r\n   - Confirm 3rd term is 32 and 6th term is 4\n\n5. Apply the sum formula for geometric sequences:\n   - Use S_n = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n = 8\n   - Plug in values for a1, r, and n = 8\n   - Calculate the sum\n\n6. Double-check the result:\n   - Manually sum the 8 terms calculated earlier\n   - Confirm it matches the formula result\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the sum of the first 8 terms\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we're at the beginning of solving this problem, our first step should be to determine the common ratio (r) of the geometric sequence. We can do this using the relationship between the 3rd and 6th terms.\n\nWe know that:\na3 = 32\na6 = 4\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is r times the previous term. So, we can set up the equation:\n\na6 = a3 * r^3\n4 = 32 * r^3\n\nTo solve this, we need to divide both sides by 32 and then take the cube root:\n\nr^3 = 4/32 = 1/8\nr = \u221b(1/8)\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute the cube root of 1/8 to find the exact value of r. This will be a crucial value for the rest of the problem-solving process.\n\nAfter finding r, we can move on to determining the first term (a1) of the sequence using the relationship between a1 and a3.\n",
