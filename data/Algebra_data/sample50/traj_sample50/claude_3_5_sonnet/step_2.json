    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given equations:\n   Equation 1: 30 + 4m - 2n = 50\n   Equation 2: m - 2n = 5\n\n2. Recognize that we need to solve for m using these two equations.\n\n3. Use substitution method:\n   a) From Equation 2, express n in terms of m:\n      n = (m - 5) / 2\n   b) Substitute this expression for n into Equation 1\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation after substitution.\n\n5. Solve the simplified equation for m.\n\n6. Verify the solution by substituting the found value of m back into both original equations.\n\n7. Present the final answer for the value of m.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any complex calculations to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully solved Equation 2 for n in terms of m, obtaining n = (m - 5) / 2. We have also substituted this expression into Equation 1. The next logical step is to simplify the resulting equation and solve for m.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Expand the substituted equation:\n   30 + 4m - 2((m - 5) / 2) = 50\n\n2. Distribute the negative 2:\n   30 + 4m - m + 5 = 50\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   35 + 3m = 50\n\n4. Subtract 35 from both sides:\n   3m = 15\n\n5. Divide both sides by 3:\n   m = 5\n\nThe acting agent should perform these algebraic operations step by step, using a calculator if needed for any arithmetic. After solving for m, we'll be ready to verify the solution in both original equations.\n",
