Use substitution method:\n   a) From Equation 2, express n in terms of m:\n      n = (m - 5) / 2\n   b) Substitute this expression for n into Equation 1\n\n4.

After subtracting 35, we'll have an equation in the form:\n   3.0*m = 15\n\n3.

After solving for m, we should verify the solution by substituting it back into both original equations to ensure it satisfies them.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations:\n1. Subtract 35 from both sides of the equation 3.0*m + 35.0 = 50\n2. Divide both sides of the resulting equation by 3.0 to solve for m\n3.
