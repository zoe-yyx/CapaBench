Use substitution method:\n   a) From Equation 2, express n in terms of m:\n      n = (m - 5) / 2\n   b) Substitute this expression for n into Equation 1\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation after substitution.\n\n5. Solve the simplified equation for m.\n\n6. Verify the solution by substituting the found value of m back into both original equations.\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on our current progress, we have successfully simplified the equation to:\n\n3.0*m = 15.0\n\nNow, we need to solve for m. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. To isolate m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.0.\n\n2. This division will give us the value of m, which is the goal of our problem.\n\n3. Given that the original equations used whole numbers, it's likely that m will also be a whole number. We should be prepared to round if necessary, but it's possible the result will be exact.\n\n4. After solving for m, we will need to verify this solution by substituting it back into both original equations:\n   - 30 + 4m - 2n = 50\n   - m - 2n = 5\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Use a calculator to divide 15.0 by 3.0 to find the value of m.\n2. If the result is not a whole number, round it to the nearest integer.\n3. Once we have the value of m, we'll be ready to verify it in the original equations in the next step.\n\nThis calculation will give us our solution for m, which we can then use to complete the problem-solving process.\n",
