    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given equations:\n   Equation 1: 30 + 4m - 2n = 50\n   Equation 2: m - 2n = 5\n\n2. Recognize that we need to solve for m using these two equations.\n\n3. Use substitution method:\n   a) From Equation 2, express n in terms of m:\n      n = (m - 5) / 2\n   b) Substitute this expression for n into Equation 1\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation after substitution.\n\n5. Solve the simplified equation for m.\n\n6. Verify the solution by substituting the found value of m back into both original equations.\n\n7. Present the final answer for the value of m.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any complex calculations to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we've already solved Equation 2 for n in terms of m, our next logical step is to substitute this expression into Equation 1. This will allow us to create a single equation with only one variable (m), which we can then solve.\n\nLet's recall that from Equation 2 (m - 2n = 5), we derived:\nn = (m - 5) / 2\n\nNow, we need to substitute this expression for n into Equation 1:\n30 + 4m - 2n = 50\n\nThe acting agent should perform this substitution:\n30 + 4m - 2((m - 5) / 2) = 50\n\nAfter this substitution, the equation will contain only m as a variable. The next step would be to simplify this equation by distributing the negative 2 and combining like terms. This will prepare us for solving for m in the subsequent steps.\n",
