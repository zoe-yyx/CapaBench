    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given equations:\n   Equation 1: 30 + 4m - 2n = 50\n   Equation 2: m - 2n = 5\n\n2. Recognize that we need to solve for m using these two equations.\n\n3. Use substitution method:\n   a) From Equation 2, express n in terms of m:\n      n = (m - 5) / 2\n   b) Substitute this expression for n into Equation 1\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation after substitution.\n\n5. Solve the simplified equation for m.\n\n6. Verify the solution by substituting the found value of m back into both original equations.\n\n7. Present the final answer for the value of m.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any complex calculations to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our current progress, we have found that m = 5 and we're now in the process of verifying this solution. We've attempted to use Equation 2 (m - 2n = 5) to solve for n, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in the last calculation.\n\nLet's correct our approach:\n\n1. We know m = 5, and we need to use Equation 2: m - 2n = 5\n\n2. Substituting m = 5 into this equation:\n   5 - 2n = 5\n\n3. To solve for n:\n   - Subtract 5 from both sides:\n     -2n = 0\n   - Divide both sides by -2:\n     n = 0\n\nNow that we have values for both m and n, we can verify these in both original equations:\n\n1. Verify Equation 1: 30 + 4m - 2n = 50\n   Substitute m = 5 and n = 0\n\n2. Verify Equation 2: m - 2n = 5\n   Substitute m = 5 and n = 0\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Calculate 30 + 4(5) - 2(0) to verify Equation 1\n2. Calculate 5 - 2(0) to verify Equation 2\n\nIf both of these calculations yield the expected results (50 for Equation 1 and 5 for Equation 2), we can confirm that our solution m = 5 is correct.\n",
