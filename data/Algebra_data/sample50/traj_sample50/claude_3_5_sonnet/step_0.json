    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given equations:\n   Equation 1: 30 + 4m - 2n = 50\n   Equation 2: m - 2n = 5\n\n2. Recognize that we need to solve for m using these two equations.\n\n3. Use substitution method:\n   a) From Equation 2, express n in terms of m:\n      n = (m - 5) / 2\n   b) Substitute this expression for n into Equation 1\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation after substitution.\n\n5. Solve the simplified equation for m.\n\n6. Verify the solution by substituting the found value of m back into both original equations.\n\n7. Present the final answer for the value of m.\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any complex calculations to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to follow the substitution method outlined in the planning strategy. Let's start by focusing on Equation 2: m - 2n = 5.\n\nFrom this equation, we can express n in terms of m. This will allow us to eliminate one variable and simplify our problem. \n\nThe next logical step is to rearrange Equation 2 to isolate n. We can do this by adding 2n to both sides of the equation and then dividing by 2.\n\nSo, our next operation should be to solve Equation 2 for n in terms of m. This will give us an expression for n that we can substitute into Equation 1.\n\nThe acting agent should perform the following steps:\n1. Add 2n to both sides of the equation m - 2n = 5\n2. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate n\n\nThis will give us the expression for n in terms of m, which is a crucial step in our substitution method.\n",
