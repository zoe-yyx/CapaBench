    "problem": "Two different geometric series, the first one is given by $a_n = 8 \\times 2^{n - 1}$ and the second one is given by $b_n = 3 \\times 3^{n - 1}$. At which index do the two series have the same sum?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of first series is $S_{1n} = \\frac{8(1 - 2^n)}{1 - 2} = 8(2^n - 1)$, and the sum of second series is $S_{2n} = \\frac{3(1 - 3^n)}{1 - 3} = \\frac{3(3^n - 1)}{2}$. Then solving equation $S_{1n} = S_{2n}$, we can determine the answer is $n = \\boxed{4}$.",
