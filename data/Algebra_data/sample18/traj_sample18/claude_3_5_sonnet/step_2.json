    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given function:\n   - Identify that g(x) = 3x - 2 is a linear function.\n   - Recognize that we need to find the value of g(-3).\n\n2. Substitute the given value:\n   - Replace x with -3 in the function g(x).\n\n3. Perform the calculation:\n   - Multiply 3 by -3.\n   - Subtract 2 from the result.\n\n4. Simplify and present the final answer:\n   - Ensure the calculation is correct.\n   - Present the final value of g(-3).\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nNote: This problem is relatively straightforward and can likely be solved in fewer than 5 rounds. The acting agent should be able to perform the necessary calculations without the need for a calculator or search engine.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe acting agent has correctly substituted -3 for x in the function g(x) = 3x - 2, resulting in g(-3) = 3(-3) - 2. The next logical step is to perform the calculation within the parentheses first, following the order of operations.\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Calculate 3(-3), which is a multiplication operation.\n2. Once that's done, proceed with subtracting 2 from the result.\n\nThis will complete the calculation of g(-3) and give us the final answer. The acting agent should be able to perform these simple arithmetic operations without a calculator, but if needed, they can use one to ensure accuracy.\n",
