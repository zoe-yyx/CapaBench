Substitute the given value:\n   - Replace x with -3 in the function g(x).\n\n3. Perform the calculation:\n   - Multiply 3 by -3.\n   - Subtract 2 from the result.\n\n4. Simplify and present the final answer:\n   - Ensure the calculation is correct.\n   - Present the final value of g(-3).\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nNote: This problem is relatively straightforward and can likely be solved in fewer than 5 rounds. The acting agent should be able to perform the necessary calculations without the need for a calculator or search engine.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have substituted -3 for x in the function g(x) = 3x - 2, we have the expression g(-3) = 3(-3) - 2. The next logical step is to evaluate this expression. We should:\n\n1. First, calculate the product 3(-3). This involves multiplying 3 by -3.\n2. Then, we need to subtract 2 from the result of step 1.\n\nThis will give us the final value of g(-3). The acting agent should be able to perform these calculations mentally or using basic arithmetic, without the need for a calculator or search engine.\n",
