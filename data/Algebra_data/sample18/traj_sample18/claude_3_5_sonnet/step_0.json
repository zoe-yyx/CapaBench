    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given function:\n   - Identify that g(x) = 3x - 2 is a linear function.\n   - Recognize that we need to find the value of g(-3).\n\n2. Substitute the given value:\n   - Replace x with -3 in the function g(x).\n\n3. Perform the calculation:\n   - Multiply 3 by -3.\n   - Subtract 2 from the result.\n\n4. Simplify and present the final answer:\n   - Ensure the calculation is correct.\n   - Present the final value of g(-3).\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nNote: This problem is relatively straightforward and can likely be solved in fewer than 5 rounds. The acting agent should be able to perform the necessary calculations without the need for a calculator or search engine.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the nature of the problem, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have the function g(x) = 3x - 2, and we need to calculate g(-3).\n\n2. To find g(-3), we need to substitute -3 for x in the function.\n\n3. The next logical step is to perform this substitution and set up the calculation.\n\n4. We should guide the acting agent to replace x with -3 in the function g(x) = 3x - 2.\n\n5. This will result in the expression: g(-3) = 3(-3) - 2\n\n6. From here, the acting agent can proceed with the calculation.\n\nThis reasoning sets up the problem for the acting agent to perform the necessary substitution and prepare for the subsequent calculation.\n",
