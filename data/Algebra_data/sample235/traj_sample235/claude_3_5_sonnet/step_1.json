Analyze the given information:\n   - Equation: x^2 + px + q = 0\n   - p and q are integers\n   - One root is twice the other\n   - Sum of roots taken three times equals 27\n\n2. Use Vieta's formulas to relate roots to coefficients:\n   - Sum of roots = -p\n   - Product of roots = q\n\n3. Let the roots be r and 2r (since one root is twice the other):\n   - r + 2r = -p\n   - r * 2r = q\n\n4. Use the sum of roots information:\n   - 3(-p) = 27 (sum of roots taken three times)\n   - Solve for p\n\n5. Express r in terms of p:\n   - 3r = -p\n\n6. Calculate q using the product of roots:\n   - q = r * 2r = 2r^2\n\n7. Express q in terms of p using the result from step 5\n\n8. Verify that p and q are integers\n\n9.
