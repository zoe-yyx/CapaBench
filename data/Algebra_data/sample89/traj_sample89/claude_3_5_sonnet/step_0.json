    "reasoning": "\nGiven the expression $\\frac{y-8}{y^2-16}$, we need to determine when it becomes undefined. A fraction is undefined when its denominator equals zero, so we should focus on the denominator $y^2-16$.\n\nLet's reason through this:\n\n1. The denominator $y^2-16$ will be zero when $y^2 = 16$.\n\n2. To solve this, we can factor the denominator:\n   $y^2-16 = (y+4)(y-4)$\n\n3. The denominator will be zero when either $(y+4) = 0$ or $(y-4) = 0$.\n\n4. Solving these:\n   $y+4 = 0$ gives $y = -4$\n   $y-4 = 0$ gives $y = 4$\n\n5. We also need to check if the numerator $y-8$ contributes any additional undefined points. However, $y-8 = 0$ when $y = 8$, which doesn't coincide with the zeros of the denominator.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning suggests that the expression will be undefined when $y = 4$ or $y = -4$. These are two distinct values.\n\nThe next step should be to verify this result by substituting these values back into the original expression to confirm it indeed becomes undefined.\n",
