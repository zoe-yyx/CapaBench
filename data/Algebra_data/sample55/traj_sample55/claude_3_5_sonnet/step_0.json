    "reasoning": "\nTo evaluate (i)\u2074, we should follow the planning strategy step by step. Let's start with the first meaningful operation:\n\n1. We can rewrite (i)\u2074 as (i\u00b2)\u00b2. This is based on the property of exponents that (a^b)^c = a^(bc). In this case, a = i, b = 2, and c = 2.\n\n2. We know that i\u00b2 = -1 by definition. This is a fundamental property of the imaginary unit i that we can use to simplify our expression.\n\n3. Therefore, we can replace i\u00b2 with -1 in our expression.\n\nSo, our next step should be to rewrite (i)\u2074 as (-1)\u00b2. This transformation will set us up for the final calculation.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with this substitution and prepare to evaluate (-1)\u00b2.\n",
