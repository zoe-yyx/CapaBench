Approach the problem step-by-step:\n   - Start with i\u2074\n   - Break it down into (i\u00b2)\u00b2\n   - Use the property of exponents: (a^b)^c = a^(b*c)\n\n3. Apply the knowledge about i\u00b2:\n   - Replace i\u00b2 with -1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Calculate the result of (-1)\u00b2\n\n5. Provide the final answer:\n   - Express the result as a real number\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of complex numbers\n   - Consider that i\u2074 should return to the real number line\n\nNote: This problem should be solvable within 2-3 rounds, as it involves straightforward steps and doesn't require complex calculations or external resources.\n",
