Verify if the equation is true for all x and y:\n   - Expand the left side of the equation (x+2y)^2\n   - Compare it with the right side x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2\n\n3. If the equation is verified to be true, proceed to step 4. If not, note any discrepancies.\n\n4. Substitute the given values:\n   x = 4\n   y = 3\n\n5. Calculate (x+2y)^2 using the substituted values:\n   - First, calculate x+2y\n   - Then, square the result\n\n6. Alternatively, calculate using the right side of the equation:\n   x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2\n   - Calculate each term separately\n   - Sum up the results\n\n7.

This will ensure we're working with a valid equation before substituting specific values.\n\nTo do this, we need to expand the left side of the equation (x+2y)^2 and compare it with the right side x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2.\n\nExpanding (x+2y)^2:\n(x+2y)(x+2y) = x^2 + 2xy + 2xy + 4y^2 = x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2\n\nWe can see that the expanded form of (x+2y)^2 is indeed equal to x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2. This verifies that the equation is true for all x and y.\n\nNow that we've confirmed the equation's validity, we can proceed to substitute the given values x = 4 and y = 3 into the equation.\n\nThe next logical step would be to calculate (x+2y)^2 using these values. We can do this by first calculating x+2y and then squaring the result.\n",
