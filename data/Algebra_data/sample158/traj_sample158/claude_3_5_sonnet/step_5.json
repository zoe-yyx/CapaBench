    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have two points on the line: (2, -2) and (10, 6)\n   - We need to find the x-intercept of this line\n\n2. Calculate the slope of the line:\n   - Use the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n   - Plug in the given points: m = (6 - (-2)) / (10 - 2)\n\n3. Find the y-intercept using the point-slope form:\n   - Use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   - Choose one of the given points and plug in the slope\n   - Solve for y to get the equation in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b\n\n4. Determine the x-intercept:\n   - The x-intercept is where y = 0\n   - Set y = 0 in the equation from step 3\n   - Solve for x\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the x-intercept satisfies the original line equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress so far, we have successfully found and verified the x-intercept of the line, which is x = 4. We have also taken an extra step to verify this result by checking the slope between our x-intercept point (4, 0) and one of the original points (2, -2), which correctly yielded a slope of 1.\n\nTo complete our verification process and ensure the robustness of our solution, we should now calculate the slope between the x-intercept point (4, 0) and the other original point (10, 6). This will confirm that all three points - (2, -2), (4, 0), and (10, 6) - are indeed collinear.\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate the slope between (4, 0) and (10, 6) using the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (6 - 0) / (10 - 4)\n\nIf this calculation also results in a slope of 1, we can confidently conclude that our solution is correct and that the x-intercept we found (x = 4) is indeed the point where the line crosses the x-axis.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute this final slope calculation.\n",
