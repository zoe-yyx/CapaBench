    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have two points on the line: (2, -2) and (10, 6)\n   - We need to find the x-intercept of this line\n\n2. Calculate the slope of the line:\n   - Use the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n   - Plug in the given points: m = (6 - (-2)) / (10 - 2)\n\n3. Find the y-intercept using the point-slope form:\n   - Use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   - Choose one of the given points and plug in the slope\n   - Solve for y to get the equation in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b\n\n4. Determine the x-intercept:\n   - The x-intercept is where y = 0\n   - Set y = 0 in the equation from step 3\n   - Solve for x\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the x-intercept satisfies the original line equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated the slope of the line (m = 1) and derived the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = x - 4). The next critical step is to find the x-intercept, which is where the line crosses the x-axis.\n\nThe x-intercept is the point where y = 0. We already have the equation of the line, so we can simply substitute y with 0 and solve for x. This will give us the x-coordinate of the x-intercept.\n\nThe acting agent has already been instructed to set y = 0 in the equation y = x - 4 and solve for x. Now, we need to guide the acting agent to perform this calculation.\n\nThe equation to solve is:\n0 = x - 4\n\nBy adding 4 to both sides, we get:\nx = 4\n\nThis x-value represents the x-intercept of the line. To verify this result, we can substitute this x-value back into the original equation to check if y indeed equals 0.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to verify this result by plugging x = 4 into the equation y = x - 4 to confirm that y = 0.\n",
