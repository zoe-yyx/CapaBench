    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have two points on the line: (2, -2) and (10, 6)\n   - We need to find the x-intercept of this line\n\n2. Calculate the slope of the line:\n   - Use the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n   - Plug in the given points: m = (6 - (-2)) / (10 - 2)\n\n3. Find the y-intercept using the point-slope form:\n   - Use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   - Choose one of the given points and plug in the slope\n   - Solve for y to get the equation in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b\n\n4. Determine the x-intercept:\n   - The x-intercept is where y = 0\n   - Set y = 0 in the equation from step 3\n   - Solve for x\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the x-intercept satisfies the original line equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation performed by the acting agent, we now know that the slope of the line is 1. This is a crucial piece of information that we'll use to find the equation of the line and ultimately the x-intercept.\n\nNow that we have the slope, our next step is to find the equation of the line using the point-slope form. We can use either of the given points for this. Let's use the point (2, -2).\n\nThe point-slope form of a line is:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nWhere m is the slope, and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n\nSubstituting our values:\ny - (-2) = 1(x - 2)\n\nOur next step should be to simplify this equation into slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). This will make it easier to find the x-intercept.\n\nThe acting agent should now algebraically manipulate this equation to get it into slope-intercept form. This involves distributing the 1 and adding 2 to both sides of the equation.\n",
