    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - We have two points on the line: (2, -2) and (10, 6)\n   - We need to find the x-intercept of this line\n\n2. Calculate the slope of the line:\n   - Use the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n   - Plug in the given points: m = (6 - (-2)) / (10 - 2)\n\n3. Find the y-intercept using the point-slope form:\n   - Use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   - Choose one of the given points and plug in the slope\n   - Solve for y to get the equation in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b\n\n4. Determine the x-intercept:\n   - The x-intercept is where y = 0\n   - Set y = 0 in the equation from step 3\n   - Solve for x\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the x-intercept satisfies the original line equation\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated the slope of the line, which is 1. Now, we need to find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). \n\nWe can use the point-slope form of a line equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\nWe'll use one of the given points, let's choose (2, -2), and the slope we calculated.\n\nThe equation is: y - (-2) = 1(x - 2)\n\nThe acting agent has already been instructed to simplify this equation into slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). Once we have this form, we'll be able to easily find the x-intercept.\n\nThe next logical step after simplification would be to set y = 0 in the slope-intercept equation and solve for x to find the x-intercept. Therefore, we should prepare for this step by ensuring we have the correct slope-intercept form of the equation.\n",
