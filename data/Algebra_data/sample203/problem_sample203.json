    "solution": "We start by recognizing that the powers of $i$ repeat every 4 cycles: $i, -1, -i, 1$. Every set of four consecutive powers sums to 0: \\[i + i^2 + i^3 + i^4 = i - 1 - i + 1 = 0.\\] The series $i^{100} + i^{101} + i^{102} + \\cdots + i^{204}$ has $105$ terms (from 100 to 204 inclusive). The number 100 modulo 4 is 0, so $i^{100} = (i^4)^{25} = 1^{25} = 1$. We can group the terms in sets of four from $i^{100}$, and we'll find there are 26 complete groups of four terms, each summing to 0, and 1 remaining term: $i^{204}$. Since $204$ modulo 4 is 0, $i^{204} = (i^4)^{51} = 1^{51} = 1$. Thus, \\[i^{100} + i^{101} + i^{102} + \\cdots + i^{204} = 26(0) + 1 = 1.\\] Therefore, the sum of the series is \\boxed{1}.",
