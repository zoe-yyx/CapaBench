    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Evaluating $i^{100} + i^{101} + i^{102} + \\cdots + i^{204}$:\n\n1. Recognize the pattern:\n   - This is a sum of powers of i, where i is the imaginary unit (i\u00b2 = -1).\n   - The powers range from 100 to 204.\n\n2. Simplify using properties of i:\n   - Recall that i\u2074 = 1, i\u00b2 = -1\n   - Group the terms based on their remainder when divided by 4\n\n3. Identify the number of terms:\n   - Calculate 204 - 100 + 1 = 105 terms in total\n\n4. Group the terms:\n   - i\u00b9\u2070\u2070, i\u00b9\u2070\u2074, i\u00b9\u2070\u2078, ..., i\u00b2\u2070\u2070, i\u00b2\u2070\u2074 (27 terms, all equal to 1)\n   - i\u00b9\u2070\u00b9, i\u00b9\u2070\u2075, i\u00b9\u2070\u2079, ..., i\u00b2\u2070\u00b9 (26 terms, all equal to i)\n   - i\u00b9\u2070\u00b2, i\u00b9\u2070\u2076, i\u00b9\u00b9\u2070, ..., i\u00b2\u2070\u00b2 (26 terms, all equal to -1)\n   - i\u00b9\u2070\u00b3, i\u00b9\u2070\u2077, i\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9, ..., i\u00b2\u2070\u00b3 (26 terms, all equal to -i)\n\n5. Sum the grouped terms:\n   - 27 + 26i - 26 - 26i\n\n6. Simplify the final result:\n   - 27 - 26 = 1\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the sum of all coefficients equals the total number of terms (105)\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum evaluates to 1\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic properties of complex numbers and efficient grouping strategies.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the fact that we're at the beginning of our problem-solving process, our first step should be to focus on understanding the pattern of the powers of i and how they repeat.\n\nLet's start by examining how the powers of i cycle:\n\n1. i\u00b9 = i\n2. i\u00b2 = -1\n3. i\u00b3 = -i\n4. i\u2074 = 1\n\nThis pattern repeats every 4 powers. Given this, we can categorize our sum based on the remainder when each power is divided by 4:\n\n- Powers that give remainder 0 when divided by 4 will equal 1\n- Powers that give remainder 1 when divided by 4 will equal i\n- Powers that give remainder 2 when divided by 4 will equal -1\n- Powers that give remainder 3 when divided by 4 will equal -i\n\nOur next step should be to count how many terms fall into each of these categories. We need to examine the powers from 100 to 204 and group them accordingly.\n\nTo do this efficiently, we should calculate how many terms are in our sum total, and then determine how these terms are distributed among the four categories.\n\nTherefore, I suggest that our next action should be to calculate the total number of terms in our sum and then determine how many terms fall into each of the four categories based on their remainders when divided by 4.\n",
