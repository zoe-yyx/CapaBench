    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we have started with Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9. Now, we need to solve this inequality to isolate x. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n2. To isolate x, we need to add 6 to both sides of the inequality\n3. Then, we need to divide both sides by 3\n\nThis process will give us the upper bound for x in our solution. After solving this inequality, we should move on to Case 2 as outlined in the planning strategy. The acting agent should perform these calculations to solve for x in this inequality.\n",
