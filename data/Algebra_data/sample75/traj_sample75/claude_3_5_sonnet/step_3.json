    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our progress, we have successfully solved both Case 1 and Case 2 of our absolute value inequality. Let's analyze our results:\n\n1. From Case 1 (3x - 6 \u2264 9), we found that x \u2264 5.\n2. From Case 2 (3x - 6 \u2265 -9), we found that x \u2265 -1.\n\nNow, we need to combine these results to get the complete solution for our original inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9. The combination of these two cases gives us:\n\n-1 \u2264 x \u2264 5\n\nThis means that x can be any value from -1 to 5, including both -1 and 5.\n\nOur next steps should be:\n\n1. Express this solution in interval notation.\n2. Verify our solution by checking if the endpoints (-1 and 5) and a point within this interval (e.g., 2) satisfy the original inequality.\n\nThe acting agent should now express the solution in interval notation and then proceed to verify the solution using the original inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 for x = -1, x = 5, and x = 2.\n",
