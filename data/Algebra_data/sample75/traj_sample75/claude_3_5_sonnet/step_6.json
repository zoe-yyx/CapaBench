    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the verification steps we've completed so far, let's reason about the current state and next steps:\n\n1. We've verified two critical points:\n   a) For x = -1 (lower bound): |3(-1) - 6| = 9\n   b) For x = 5 (upper bound): |3(5) - 6| = 9\n\n   Both of these results equal our upper limit of 9, confirming that -1 and 5 are indeed the correct endpoints of our solution interval.\n\n2. To complete our verification process, we still need to check a point within the interval. As suggested earlier, let's use x = 2.\n\n3. Checking x = 2 will confirm that points inside the interval [-1, 5] satisfy the original inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9.\n\n4. After this final verification, we can confidently present our solution.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be:\n\nCalculate |3(2) - 6| and compare it to 9. If this result is less than or equal to 9, our solution will be fully verified.\n\nOnce this calculation is done, we can conclude our problem-solving process by stating:\n\nThe range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 is [-1, 5] in interval notation, as we have verified that:\n- The lower bound -1 satisfies the equation (equals 9)\n- The upper bound 5 satisfies the equation (equals 9)\n- A point within the interval (2) satisfies the inequality (should be less than 9)\n\nThe acting agent should now use the calculator to perform this final calculation: |3(2) - 6|\n",
