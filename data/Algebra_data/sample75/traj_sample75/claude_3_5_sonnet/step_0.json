    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this inequality, we should start by breaking down the absolute value inequality as outlined in step 2 of our planning strategy. This will give us two cases to solve:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\nCase 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\nLet's focus on solving Case 1 first, as it's the simpler of the two cases. We need to solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9 for x.\n\nTo do this, we should:\n1. Add 6 to both sides of the inequality to isolate the term with x.\n2. Then divide both sides by 3 to isolate x.\n\nThis process will give us one boundary for our solution. After solving Case 1, we'll move on to Case 2, which will provide the other boundary.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with solving Case 1 by performing these algebraic operations.\n",
