    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the current progress, we have solved Case 1 and found that x \u2264 5. Now, we need to move on to Case 2 as outlined in our planning strategy. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to solve Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n2. First, we should simplify this inequality by removing the negative sign:\n   3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n3. To isolate x, we need to:\n   a) Add 6 to both sides of the inequality\n   b) Divide both sides by 3\n\nThis process will give us the lower bound for x in our solution. After solving this inequality, we will have both the upper and lower bounds for x, which we can then combine to form the complete solution.\n\nThe acting agent should perform these calculations to solve for x in this second inequality. Once we have this result, we can move on to combining the results from both cases and expressing the solution as an interval.\n",
