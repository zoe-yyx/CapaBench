    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the verification step we've just completed for x = -1, let's continue our reasoning:\n\n1. We've verified that |3(-1) - 6| = 9, which equals our upper bound of 9. This confirms that -1 is indeed a valid endpoint of our solution interval.\n\n2. Next, we should verify the other endpoint, x = 5:\n   We need to calculate |3(5) - 6| and compare it to 9.\n\n3. After that, we should check a point within the interval, as suggested earlier, x = 2:\n   We need to calculate |3(2) - 6| and compare it to 9.\n\n4. If both of these calculations yield results less than or equal to 9, our solution will be fully verified.\n\n5. Once verified, we can confidently present our final answer: The range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 is [-1, 5] in interval notation.\n\nThe acting agent should now use the calculator to perform these two remaining calculations:\na) |3(5) - 6|\nb) |3(2) - 6|\n\nAfter these calculations, we'll be able to conclude our problem-solving process and present the final, verified solution.\n",
