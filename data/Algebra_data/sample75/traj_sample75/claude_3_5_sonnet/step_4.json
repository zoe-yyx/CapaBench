    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our progress so far, we have successfully solved both Case 1 and Case 2 of our absolute value inequality. Let's summarize our findings and reason about the next steps:\n\n1. From Case 1 (3x - 6 \u2264 9), we found that x \u2264 5\n2. From Case 2 (3x - 6 \u2265 -9), we found that x \u2265 -1\n3.

Check if the endpoints (-1 and 5) satisfy the original inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9\n2. Check if a point within the interval (e.g., 2) satisfies the original inequality\n\nThis verification step is crucial to ensure our solution is correct.
