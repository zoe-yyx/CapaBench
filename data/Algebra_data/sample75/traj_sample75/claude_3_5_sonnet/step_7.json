    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality\n   - The goal is to find the range of x that satisfies this condition\n\n2. Break down the absolute value inequality:\n   - The inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 can be split into two cases:\n     Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n     Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9\n\n3. Solve Case 1:\n   - Solve the inequality 3x - 6 \u2264 9\n   - Isolate x on one side of the inequality\n\n4. Solve Case 2:\n   - Simplify -(3x - 6) \u2264 9 to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9\n   - Solve this inequality for x\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Find the intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2\n   - This will give the range of x that satisfies the original inequality\n\n6. Express the solution as an interval:\n   - Write the final answer in interval notation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the endpoints and a point within the interval satisfy the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the range of x that satisfies |3x - 6| \u2264 9 in interval notation\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our comprehensive verification process, we have successfully confirmed our solution. Let's summarize our findings and conclude the problem-solving process:\n\n1. We solved the inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 by considering two cases:\n   Case 1: 3x - 6 \u2264 9, which gave us x \u2264 5\n   Case 2: -(3x - 6) \u2264 9, which simplified to 3x - 6 \u2265 -9, giving us x \u2265 -1\n\n2. We combined these results to get the interval [-1, 5]\n\n3. We verified our solution by checking:\n   a) Lower bound: |3(-1) - 6| = 9, which equals our upper limit\n   b) Upper bound: |3(5) - 6| = 9, which equals our upper limit\n   c) A point within the interval: |3(2) - 6| = 0, which is less than 9\n\nAll these verifications confirm that our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that the range of x that satisfies the inequality |3x - 6| \u2264 9 is [-1, 5] in interval notation.\n\nThe next step would be for the acting agent to formally present this final, verified solution as the answer to the original problem.\n",
