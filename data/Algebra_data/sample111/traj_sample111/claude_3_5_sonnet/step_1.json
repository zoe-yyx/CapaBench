Solve the resulting linear equation:\n   - Simplify the logarithmic equation\n   - Isolate x on one side of the equation\n\n4. Check the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation\n   - Verify that both sides are equal\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that satisfies the equation\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for any necessary calculations, especially when dealing with logarithms or exponents.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we've rewritten the equation using 4 as the base for both sides, our next step should be to express the right side of the equation in terms of 4. We know that 64 = 4^3, so we can rewrite 64^x as (4^3)^x.\n\nThe reasoning for the next operation is:\n\n1. Replace 64^x with (4^3)^x on the right side of the equation.\n2. This will allow us to have the same base (4) on both sides of the equation, which is crucial for applying logarithm properties in the next steps.\n3. After this substitution, we'll have an equation where both sides are expressed as powers of 4, making it easier to solve using logarithmic properties.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with this substitution, resulting in an equation of the form:\n\n4^(2x+1) = (4^3)^x\n\nThis step is essential for progressing towards applying logarithms and solving for x.\n",
