We've verified this solution by substituting x = 1 back into the original equation:\n   - Left side: 4^(2x+1) = 4^(2(1)+1) = 4^3 = 64\n   - Right side: 64^x = 64^1 = 64\n\n3. Both sides of the equation equal 64, confirming that our solution x = 1 is correct.\n\nGiven this verification, we can conclude that the solution to the original equation 4^(2x+1) = 64^x is indeed x = 1.\n\nThe next step should be to formulate a clear and concise final answer to the problem.
