    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive)\n   - For each z, calculate |z^2 - 9|\n   - Check if the result is a prime number\n   - If it is, include this z in our solution set\n   - Finally, calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n2. List out the possible integer values for z:\n   - z can be: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n3. For each z value:\n   a) Calculate z^2\n   b) Subtract 9 from z^2\n   c) Take the absolute value of the result\n   d) Check if this value is prime\n\n4. Determine primality:\n   - For each result from step 3, check if it's prime\n   - A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n   - We can use a simple primality test for small numbers\n\n5. Keep track of z values that yield prime results\n\n6. Calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n7. Double-check the result by verifying each step\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within 10 rounds, as we have a finite set of integers to check and straightforward calculations to perform.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculation, we have confirmed that for z = -4, |z^2 - 9| = 7.\n\nNow, we need to determine if 7 is a prime number. Although 7 is a well-known prime number, let's approach this systematically for consistency in our problem-solving method:\n\n1. Recall that a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n2. We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of 7 (which is approximately 2.65).\n3. The only integer to check is 2.\n\nWe should verify that 7 is not divisible by 2. If confirmed, we can conclude that 7 is indeed prime.\n\nAfter this verification, we should move on to the next value of z, which is -3.\n\nFor z = -3, we need to:\n1. Calculate z^2: (-3)^2\n2. Subtract 9 from the result\n3. Take the absolute value\n4. Check if the result is prime\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations for z = -3, following the same process we used for z = -4.\n",
