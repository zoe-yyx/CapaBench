    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive)\n   - For each z, calculate |z^2 - 9|\n   - Check if the result is a prime number\n   - If it is, include this z in our solution set\n   - Finally, calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n2. List out the possible integer values for z:\n   - z can be: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n3. For each z value:\n   a) Calculate z^2\n   b) Subtract 9 from z^2\n   c) Take the absolute value of the result\n   d) Check if this value is prime\n\n4. Determine primality:\n   - For each result from step 3, check if it's prime\n   - A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n   - We can use a simple primality test for small numbers\n\n5. Keep track of z values that yield prime results\n\n6. Calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n7. Double-check the result by verifying each step\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within 10 rounds, as we have a finite set of integers to check and straightforward calculations to perform.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and reasoning, we've determined that:\n1. For z = -4, |z^2 - 9| = 7, which is prime.\n2. For z = -3, |z^2 - 9| = 0, which is not prime.\n3. For z = -2, |z^2 - 9| = 5, which is prime.\n\nNow, we should continue our systematic approach by evaluating the next value of z, which is -1. Let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: (-1)^2 = 1\n2. Subtract 9: 1 - 9 = -8\n3. Take the absolute value: |-8| = 8\n\nWe now need to determine if 8 is a prime number. We can quickly reason that 8 is not prime because:\n1. It's an even number greater than 2.\n2. It's divisible by 2 and 4.\n\nTherefore, -1 is not a solution to our problem.\n\nWe should move on to the next value of z, which is 0. For z = 0:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: 0^2 = 0\n2. Subtract 9: 0 - 9 = -9\n3. Take the absolute value: |-9| = 9\n\nNow we need to determine if 9 is a prime number. We can reason that 9 is not prime because:\n1. It's an odd number, but it's divisible by 3 (3 * 3 = 9).\n\nTherefore, 0 is also not a solution to our problem.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to verify these calculations, specifically:\n1. Calculate |(-1)^2 - 9| to confirm it equals 8\n2. Calculate |0^2 - 9| to confirm it equals 9\n\nAfter these calculations, we'll be ready to move on to the positive values of z, starting with z = 1.\n",
