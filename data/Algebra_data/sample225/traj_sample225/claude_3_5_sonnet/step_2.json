    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive)\n   - For each z, calculate |z^2 - 9|\n   - Check if the result is a prime number\n   - If it is, include this z in our solution set\n   - Finally, calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n2. List out the possible integer values for z:\n   - z can be: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n3. For each z value:\n   a) Calculate z^2\n   b) Subtract 9 from z^2\n   c) Take the absolute value of the result\n   d) Check if this value is prime\n\n4. Determine primality:\n   - For each result from step 3, check if it's prime\n   - A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n   - We can use a simple primality test for small numbers\n\n5. Keep track of z values that yield prime results\n\n6. Calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n7. Double-check the result by verifying each step\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within 10 rounds, as we have a finite set of integers to check and straightforward calculations to perform.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations and actions, we've determined that:\n1. For z = -4, |z^2 - 9| = 7, which is prime.\n2. For z = -3, |z^2 - 9| = 0, which is not prime.\n\nNow, we should continue our systematic approach by evaluating the next value of z, which is -2. Let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: (-2)^2 = 4\n2. Subtract 9: 4 - 9 = -5\n3. Take the absolute value: |-5| = 5\n\nWe now need to determine if 5 is a prime number. While 5 is a well-known prime, let's maintain our systematic approach:\n\n1. 5 is greater than 2 (the smallest prime number).\n2. We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of 5 (approximately 2.24).\n3. The only integer to check is 2.\n\nWe should verify that 5 is not divisible by 2. If confirmed, we can conclude that 5 is indeed prime.\n\nAfter this verification, -2 will be another solution to our problem.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations for z = -2, specifically calculating |(-2)^2 - 9|, and then verify that the result (5) is not divisible by 2.\n\nOnce this is done, we'll be ready to move on to the next value of z, which is -1.\n",
