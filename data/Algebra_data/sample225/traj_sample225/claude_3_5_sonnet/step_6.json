    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive)\n   - For each z, calculate |z^2 - 9|\n   - Check if the result is a prime number\n   - If it is, include this z in our solution set\n   - Finally, calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n2. List out the possible integer values for z:\n   - z can be: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n3. For each z value:\n   a) Calculate z^2\n   b) Subtract 9 from z^2\n   c) Take the absolute value of the result\n   d) Check if this value is prime\n\n4. Determine primality:\n   - For each result from step 3, check if it's prime\n   - A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n   - We can use a simple primality test for small numbers\n\n5. Keep track of z values that yield prime results\n\n6. Calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n7. Double-check the result by verifying each step\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within 10 rounds, as we have a finite set of integers to check and straightforward calculations to perform.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our systematic approach and calculations, we have successfully identified all the integer solutions for z between -5 and 5 (exclusive) that satisfy the condition |z^2 - 9| equals a prime number. We have also calculated the product of these solutions.\n\nLet's summarize our findings and reasoning:\n\n1. We identified four integer solutions: -4, -2, 2, and 4.\n2. For each of these values:\n   - |-4^2 - 9| = |16 - 9| = 7 (prime)\n   - |-2^2 - 9| = |4 - 9| = 5 (prime)\n   - |2^2 - 9| = |4 - 9| = 5 (prime)\n   - |4^2 - 9| = |16 - 9| = 7 (prime)\n3. We calculated the product of these solutions: (-4) * (-2) * 2 * 4 = 64\n\nNow that we have our final result, we should verify that it satisfies all the conditions of the original problem:\n\n1. All solutions are integers between -5 and 5 (exclusive): \u2713\n2. For each solution, |z^2 - 9| is a prime number: \u2713\n3. We have found the product of all such solutions: \u2713\n\nThe acting agent has performed all necessary calculations, and we have our final answer: 64.\n\nAt this point, we have successfully solved the problem. The next step would be for the reflecting agent to review our process, confirm the accuracy of our solution, and suggest any potential improvements or alternative approaches for future similar problems.\n",
