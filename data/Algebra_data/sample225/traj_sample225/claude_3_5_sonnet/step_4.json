    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive)\n   - For each z, calculate |z^2 - 9|\n   - Check if the result is a prime number\n   - If it is, include this z in our solution set\n   - Finally, calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n2. List out the possible integer values for z:\n   - z can be: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n3. For each z value:\n   a) Calculate z^2\n   b) Subtract 9 from z^2\n   c) Take the absolute value of the result\n   d) Check if this value is prime\n\n4. Determine primality:\n   - For each result from step 3, check if it's prime\n   - A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n   - We can use a simple primality test for small numbers\n\n5. Keep track of z values that yield prime results\n\n6. Calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n7. Double-check the result by verifying each step\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within 10 rounds, as we have a finite set of integers to check and straightforward calculations to perform.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and reasoning, we've determined that:\n1. For z = -4, |z^2 - 9| = 7, which is prime.\n2. For z = -3, |z^2 - 9| = 0, which is not prime.\n3. For z = -2, |z^2 - 9| = 5, which is prime.\n4. For z = -1, |z^2 - 9| = 8, which is not prime.\n5. For z = 0, |z^2 - 9| = 9, which is not prime.\n\nNow, we should continue our systematic approach by evaluating the next value of z, which is 1. Let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: 1^2 = 1\n2. Subtract 9: 1 - 9 = -8\n3. Take the absolute value: |-8| = 8\n\nWe already know that 8 is not prime, so z = 1 is not a solution to our problem.\n\nLet's move on to z = 2:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: 2^2 = 4\n2. Subtract 9: 4 - 9 = -5\n3. Take the absolute value: |-5| = 5\n\nWe've already determined that 5 is prime, so z = 2 is a solution to our problem.\n\nFor completeness, let's continue with z = 3:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: 3^2 = 9\n2. Subtract 9: 9 - 9 = 0\n3. Take the absolute value: |0| = 0\n\n0 is not prime, so z = 3 is not a solution.\n\nFinally, let's check z = 4:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: 4^2 = 16\n2. Subtract 9: 16 - 9 = 7\n3. Take the absolute value: |7| = 7\n\nWe've already determined that 7 is prime, so z = 4 is also a solution.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to verify these calculations, specifically:\n1. Calculate |1^2 - 9| to confirm it equals 8\n2. Calculate |2^2 - 9| to confirm it equals 5\n3. Calculate |3^2 - 9| to confirm it equals 0\n4. Calculate |4^2 - 9| to confirm it equals 7\n\nAfter these calculations, we'll have completed checking all integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive) and can move on to finding the product of the solutions.\n",
