    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive)\n   - For each z, calculate |z^2 - 9|\n   - Check if the result is a prime number\n   - If it is, include this z in our solution set\n   - Finally, calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n2. List out the possible integer values for z:\n   - z can be: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n3. For each z value:\n   a) Calculate z^2\n   b) Subtract 9 from z^2\n   c) Take the absolute value of the result\n   d) Check if this value is prime\n\n4. Determine primality:\n   - For each result from step 3, check if it's prime\n   - A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n   - We can use a simple primality test for small numbers\n\n5. Keep track of z values that yield prime results\n\n6. Calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n7. Double-check the result by verifying each step\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within 10 rounds, as we have a finite set of integers to check and straightforward calculations to perform.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe should start by systematically checking each possible integer value for z between -4 and 4. Let's begin with z = -4:\n\n1. Calculate z^2: (-4)^2 = 16\n2. Subtract 9: 16 - 9 = 7\n3. Take the absolute value: |7| = 7\n4. Check if 7 is prime\n\nWe need to determine if 7 is a prime number. Since this is a relatively small number, we can use a simple primality test. \n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations and then use a search engine or mathematical knowledge to confirm whether 7 is prime.\n\nIf 7 is confirmed to be prime, then -4 will be one of our solutions. We should then move on to the next value of z (-3) and repeat the process.\n",
