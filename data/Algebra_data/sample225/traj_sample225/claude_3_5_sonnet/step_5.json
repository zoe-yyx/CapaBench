    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to find integer values of z between -5 and 5 (exclusive)\n   - For each z, calculate |z^2 - 9|\n   - Check if the result is a prime number\n   - If it is, include this z in our solution set\n   - Finally, calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n2. List out the possible integer values for z:\n   - z can be: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n3. For each z value:\n   a) Calculate z^2\n   b) Subtract 9 from z^2\n   c) Take the absolute value of the result\n   d) Check if this value is prime\n\n4. Determine primality:\n   - For each result from step 3, check if it's prime\n   - A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n   - We can use a simple primality test for small numbers\n\n5. Keep track of z values that yield prime results\n\n6. Calculate the product of all valid z values\n\n7. Double-check the result by verifying each step\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within 10 rounds, as we have a finite set of integers to check and straightforward calculations to perform.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our systematic approach and calculations, we have now checked all integer values of z between -4 and 4. Let's summarize our findings:\n\n1. z = -4: |(-4)^2 - 9| = 7 (prime)\n2. z = -3: |(-3)^2 - 9| = 0 (not prime)\n3. z = -2: |(-2)^2 - 9| = 5 (prime)\n4. z = -1: |(-1)^2 - 9| = 8 (not prime)\n5. z = 0: |0^2 - 9| = 9 (not prime)\n6. z = 1: |1^2 - 9| = 8 (not prime)\n7. z = 2: |2^2 - 9| = 5 (prime)\n8. z = 3: |3^2 - 9| = 0 (not prime)\n9. z = 4: |4^2 - 9| = 7 (prime)\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the integer solutions for z are: -4, -2, 2, and 4.\n\nThe final step of our problem is to find the product of these solutions. We should now instruct the acting agent to multiply these values:\n\n-4 * -2 * 2 * 4\n\nThis multiplication will give us the final answer to our problem. After this calculation, we will have successfully solved the entire problem and can present the final result.\n",
