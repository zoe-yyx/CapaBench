    "solution": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Slope of the Line**:\n   The slope $m$ of the line passing through points $(2, 3)$ and $(p, 17)$ is given by the formula:\n   $$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{17 - 3}{p - 2} = \\frac{14}{p - 2}$$\n\n2. **Write the Point-Slope Form of the Line**:\n   Using the point $(2, 3)$ and the slope $m$, the equation of the line can be written as:\n   $$y - 3 = \\frac{14}{p - 2}(x - 2)$$\n\n3. **Substitute the Point (10, q) into the Equation**:\n   To find $q$, substitute $x = 10$ and $y = q$ into the equation:\n   $$q - 3 = \\frac{14}{p - 2}(10 - 2)$$\n   $$q - 3 = \\frac{14}{p - 2} \\cdot 8$$\n   $$q = \\frac{112}{p - 2} + 3$$\n\n4. **Find the Expression for p + q**:\n   Now, we have $q$ in terms of $p$:\n   $$p + q = p + \\left(\\frac{112}{p - 2} + 3\\right)$$\n   $$p + q = p + \\frac{112}{p - 2} + 3$$\n   $$p + q = \\frac{p(p - 2) + 112 + 3(p - 2)}{p - 2}$$\n   $$p + q = \\frac{p^2 - 2p + 112 + 3p - 6}{p - 2}$$\n   $$p + q = \\frac{p^2 + p + 106}{p - 2}$$\n\n5. **Minimize p + q Using AM-GM Inequality**:\n   To find the minimum value of $p + q$, we use the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality). For non-negative numbers $a$ and $b$:\n   $$\\frac{a + b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab}$$\n   Here, let $a = p - 2$ and $b = \\frac{112}{p - 2}$:\n   $$\\frac{(p - 2) + \\frac{112}{p - 2}}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{(p - 2) \\cdot \\frac{112}{p - 2}}$$\n   $$p - 2 + \\frac{112}{p - 2} \\geq 2\\sqrt{112}$$\n   Adding 5 (since $p + q = \\frac{(p - 2) + \\frac{112}{p - 2} + 5(p - 2)}{p - 2}$):\n   $$p + q \\geq 2\\sqrt{112} + 5$$\n   $$p + q \\geq 2 \\cdot 4\\sqrt{7} + 5$$\n   $$p + q \\geq 8\\sqrt{7} + 5$$\n\n   Equality holds when $a = b$, i.e., $p - 2 = \\frac{112}{p - 2}$:\n   Solving this equation gives us the value of $p$ that minimizes $p + q$:\n   $$(p - 2)^2 = 112$$\n   $$p^2 - 4p + 4 = 112$$\n   $$p^2 - 4p - 108 = 0$$\n   Solving this quadratic equation, we get two values for $p$ (one positive and one negative). Since $p > 2$, we take the positive value.\n\n   Let's denote the positive root as $p_{min}$. Substitute $p_{min}$ back into the expression for $q$ to find $q_{min}$.\n\n6. **Calculate the Final Answer**:\n   The minimum value of $p + q$ is then $p_{min} + q_{min}$.\n\n   **Note**: Without solving the quadratic equation explicitly, we can't give an exact decimal value for $p_{min} + q_{min}$. However, we know it's approximately:\n   $$p_{min} + q_{min} \\approx \\boxed{8\\sqrt{7} + 5} \\approx 28.29$$\n   (This approximation is based on the fact that $\\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.646$ and $8 \\cdot 2.646 + 5 \\approx 28.29$)",
