    "planning_context": "\n1. Review the key information given in the problem:\n   - It's a geometric sequence\n   - First term (a1) = 24\n   - Common ratio (r) = 0.5\n   - We need to find the 5th term\n\n2. Recall the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:\n   an = a1 * r^(n-1)\n   Where:\n   an = nth term\n   a1 = first term\n   r = common ratio\n   n = position of the term we're looking for\n\n3. Apply the formula to find the 5th term:\n   a5 = 24 * (0.5)^(5-1)\n\n4. Calculate the exponent: 5-1 = 4\n\n5. Solve the equation:\n   a5 = 24 * (0.5)^4\n\n6. Use a calculator to compute (0.5)^4\n\n7. Multiply the result by 24 to get the final answer\n\n8. Double-check the calculation and round if necessary\n\n9. Present the final answer as the 5th term of the sequence\n\n10. (Optional) Verify the answer by calculating the first 5 terms of the sequence manually\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated (0.5)^4 = 0.0625, we can proceed with the final calculation to find the 5th term of the geometric sequence. \n\nThe next logical step is to multiply this result by the first term of the sequence (24) as per our formula:\n\na5 = 24 * (0.5)^4\n\nWe have:\n24 * 0.0625\n\nThis multiplication will give us the exact value of the 5th term in the sequence. After performing this calculation, we will have our final answer.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 24 by 0.0625 to ensure accuracy in the final result.\n",
