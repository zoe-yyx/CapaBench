    "planning_context": "\n1. Review the key information given in the problem:\n   - It's a geometric sequence\n   - First term (a1) = 24\n   - Common ratio (r) = 0.5\n   - We need to find the 5th term\n\n2. Recall the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:\n   an = a1 * r^(n-1)\n   Where:\n   an = nth term\n   a1 = first term\n   r = common ratio\n   n = position of the term we're looking for\n\n3. Apply the formula to find the 5th term:\n   a5 = 24 * (0.5)^(5-1)\n\n4. Calculate the exponent: 5-1 = 4\n\n5. Solve the equation:\n   a5 = 24 * (0.5)^4\n\n6. Use a calculator to compute (0.5)^4\n\n7. Multiply the result by 24 to get the final answer\n\n8. Double-check the calculation and round if necessary\n\n9. Present the final answer as the 5th term of the sequence\n\n10. (Optional) Verify the answer by calculating the first 5 terms of the sequence manually\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the information provided, we should guide the acting agent to follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. We need to use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: an = a1 * r^(n-1)\n\n2. We have all the necessary information to plug into this formula:\n   a1 = 24 (first term)\n   r = 0.5 (common ratio)\n   n = 5 (we're looking for the 5th term)\n\n3. Let's substitute these values into the formula:\n   a5 = 24 * (0.5)^(5-1)\n\n4. Simplify the exponent:\n   a5 = 24 * (0.5)^4\n\n5. Now, we need to calculate (0.5)^4. This is a calculation that's best done with a calculator for accuracy.\n\n6. Once we have the result of (0.5)^4, we'll need to multiply it by 24.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use a calculator to compute (0.5)^4, and then multiply the result by 24. This will give us the value of the 5th term in the sequence.\n",
