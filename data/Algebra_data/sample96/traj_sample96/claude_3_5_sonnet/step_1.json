    "observation": "Lisa is three times as old as Jane. Four years ago, the sum of their ages was 24. How old is Jane now?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Age Problem:\n\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = Jane's current age\n   Let y = Lisa's current age\n\n2. Set up equations based on given information:\n   Equation 1: y = 3x (Lisa is three times as old as Jane)\n   Equation 2: (x - 4) + (y - 4) = 24 (Sum of their ages 4 years ago was 24)\n\n3. Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n   (x - 4) + (3x - 4) = 24\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   4x - 8 = 24\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   4x = 32\n   x = 8\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate Lisa's age: y = 3x = 3(8) = 24\n   - Check if the sum of their ages 4 years ago equals 24:\n     (8 - 4) + (24 - 4) = 4 + 20 = 24\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   Jane is currently 8 years old\n\nThis plan should allow the agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for any necessary calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous action, we have successfully set up the equation:\n\n(x - 4) + (3x - 4) = 24\n\nNow, we need to simplify this equation to solve for x. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n   (x - 4) + (3x - 4) = x + 3x - 8 = 4x - 8\n\n2. So our simplified equation becomes:\n   4x - 8 = 24\n\n3. To solve for x, we need to isolate it:\n   - First, add 8 to both sides:\n     4x = 32\n\n   - Then, divide both sides by 4:\n     x = 8\n\nThe next logical step is to use a calculator to perform these operations and verify that x = 8 is indeed the solution.\n\nOnce we confirm x = 8, we can conclude that Jane is currently 8 years old.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations and verify the solution.\n",
