    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Age Problem:\n\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = Jane's current age\n   Let y = Lisa's current age\n\n2. Set up equations based on given information:\n   Equation 1: y = 3x (Lisa is three times as old as Jane)\n   Equation 2: (x - 4) + (y - 4) = 24 (Sum of their ages 4 years ago was 24)\n\n3. Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n   (x - 4) + (3x - 4) = 24\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   4x - 8 = 24\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   4x = 32\n   x = 8\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate Lisa's age: y = 3x = 3(8) = 24\n   - Check if the sum of their ages 4 years ago equals 24:\n     (8 - 4) + (24 - 4) = 4 + 20 = 24\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   Jane is currently 8 years old\n\nThis plan should allow the agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for any necessary calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have solved for Jane's age (x = 8), we need to verify our solution and complete the problem. Let's break this down into steps:\n\n1. Verify Lisa's age:\n   We know that Lisa is three times as old as Jane.\n   Lisa's age = 3 * Jane's age = 3 * 8 = 24\n\n2. Check if the sum of their ages 4 years ago equals 24:\n   Jane's age 4 years ago: 8 - 4 = 4\n   Lisa's age 4 years ago: 24 - 4 = 20\n   Sum of their ages 4 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24\n\n3. Formulate the final answer:\n   If all calculations check out, we can conclude that Jane is currently 8 years old.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these verification calculations. This will ensure our solution is correct and complete the problem-solving process.\n",
