    "observation": "Lisa is three times as old as Jane. Four years ago, the sum of their ages was 24. How old is Jane now?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Age Problem:\n\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = Jane's current age\n   Let y = Lisa's current age\n\n2. Set up equations based on given information:\n   Equation 1: y = 3x (Lisa is three times as old as Jane)\n   Equation 2: (x - 4) + (y - 4) = 24 (Sum of their ages 4 years ago was 24)\n\n3. Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n   (x - 4) + (3x - 4) = 24\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   4x - 8 = 24\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   4x = 32\n   x = 8\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate Lisa's age: y = 3x = 3(8) = 24\n   - Check if the sum of their ages 4 years ago equals 24:\n     (8 - 4) + (24 - 4) = 4 + 20 = 24\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   Jane is currently 8 years old\n\nThis plan should allow the agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for any necessary calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we should focus on setting up the equations based on the given information. The planning strategy has already defined the variables and outlined the equations we need. Let's start by formally stating these equations:\n\n1. Let x represent Jane's current age\n2. Let y represent Lisa's current age\n\nNow, we can set up two key equations:\n\nEquation 1: y = 3x\nThis represents the fact that Lisa is three times as old as Jane.\n\nEquation 2: (x - 4) + (y - 4) = 24\nThis represents the sum of their ages 4 years ago being 24.\n\nThe next logical step is to substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2 to create a single equation with one variable. This will allow us to solve for Jane's age (x).\n\nThe acting agent should proceed by substituting y = 3x into Equation 2 and then simplify the resulting equation. This will set us up to solve for x in the subsequent steps.\n",
