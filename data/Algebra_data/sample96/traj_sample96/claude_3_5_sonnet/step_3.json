    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Age Problem:\n\n1. Define variables:\n   Let x = Jane's current age\n   Let y = Lisa's current age\n\n2. Set up equations based on given information:\n   Equation 1: y = 3x (Lisa is three times as old as Jane)\n   Equation 2: (x - 4) + (y - 4) = 24 (Sum of their ages 4 years ago was 24)\n\n3. Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n   (x - 4) + (3x - 4) = 24\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   4x - 8 = 24\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   4x = 32\n   x = 8\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Calculate Lisa's age: y = 3x = 3(8) = 24\n   - Check if the sum of their ages 4 years ago equals 24:\n     (8 - 4) + (24 - 4) = 4 + 20 = 24\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   Jane is currently 8 years old\n\nThis plan should allow the agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit. The acting agent can use a calculator for any necessary calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and verifications, we have successfully solved the problem and confirmed our solution. Let's summarize our findings and reasoning:\n\n1. We found that Jane's current age (x) is 8 years old.\n2. We verified that Lisa's current age is 24 years old (3 * 8 = 24).\n3. We checked that the sum of their ages 4 years ago was indeed 24 (4 + 20 = 24).\n\nOur solution satisfies all the conditions given in the original problem:\n- Lisa is three times as old as Jane (24 is three times 8).\n- Four years ago, the sum of their ages was 24 (when Jane was 4 and Lisa was 20).\n\nAt this point, we have completed all necessary calculations and verifications. The next logical step would be to formulate a clear and concise final answer to the original question.\n\nThe acting agent should now focus on presenting the final answer in a clear statement, addressing the specific question asked in the problem: \"How old is Jane now?\"\n",
