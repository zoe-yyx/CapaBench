    "observation": "If a bike travels along a circular track of radius 50 meters and makes 15 revolutions, how many revolutions would a bike need to make to travel the same distance on a circular track of radius 25 meters?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - Track 1: radius = 50 meters, revolutions = 15\n   - Track 2: radius = 25 meters, revolutions = unknown\n\n2. Calculate the distance traveled on Track 1:\n   - Use the formula: Distance = 2 * \u03c0 * radius * number of revolutions\n   - Plug in values for Track 1\n\n3. Set up an equation for Track 2:\n   - Use the same distance formula\n   - Set it equal to the distance calculated for Track 1\n   - Solve for the unknown number of revolutions\n\n4. Simplify and solve the equation:\n   - Cancel out common terms\n   - Isolate the variable for revolutions on Track 2\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense logically\n   - Ensure the units are correct\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the number of revolutions needed on Track 2\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy, we should start by calculating the distance traveled on Track 1. This will be our first concrete step in solving the problem.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the formula:\nDistance = 2 * \u03c0 * radius * number of revolutions\n\nFor Track 1, we have:\n- radius = 50 meters\n- number of revolutions = 15\n\nWe need to plug these values into the formula and calculate the total distance. This calculation will involve multiplying by \u03c0, so we should use a calculator for accuracy.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to compute:\n2 * \u03c0 * 50 * 15\n\nThis will give us the total distance traveled on Track 1, which we'll need for the next steps of our solution.\n",
