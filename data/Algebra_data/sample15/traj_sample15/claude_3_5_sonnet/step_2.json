Add x and y\n   b. Raise the result to the power of y\n   c. Store this result for later use\n\n3. Calculate x^(y+2):\n   a. Add 2 to y\n   b. Raise x to the power of the result from step 3a\n   c. Store this result for later use\n\n4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3:\n   a. Sum up the two stored results\n\n5. Present the final answer\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem within the 10-round limit, using basic arithmetic operations and exponentiation.
