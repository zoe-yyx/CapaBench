Analyze the given information:\n   - Function f(x) is a line segment from (0, 0) to (10, 20)\n   - Function g(x) is a line segment from (0, 20) to (10, 0)\n   - We need to find f(5) - g(5)\n\n2. Determine the equations of both lines:\n   - For f(x), use the point-slope form or two-point form to derive the equation\n   - For g(x), use the same method to derive its equation\n\n3. Calculate the values of f(5) and g(5):\n   - Use the equations derived in step 2\n   - Substitute x = 5 into both equations\n\n4. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Subtract g(5) from f(5)\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense geometrically\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the verification of f(x) = 2x at x = 0, which yielded 0 as expected, we can proceed with confidence in our equation for f(x). Now, let's focus on determining the equation for g(x):\n\n1. For g(x), we have two points: (0, 20) and (10, 0).\n2. We'll use the same point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n3. Calculate the slope: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (0 - 20) / (10 - 0) = -2\n4. Using the point (0, 20), we can write: y - 20 = -2(x - 0)\n5. Simplifying, we get: y = -2x + 20 or g(x) = -2x + 20\n\nNow that we have equations for both f(x) and g(x), we can proceed to calculate their values at x = 5:\n\nFor f(5): f(5) = 2(5) = 10\nFor g(5): g(5) = -2(5) + 20 = -10 + 20 = 10\n\nThe next step is to calculate f(5) - g(5).
