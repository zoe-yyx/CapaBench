    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Function f(x) is a line segment from (0, 0) to (10, 20)\n   - Function g(x) is a line segment from (0, 20) to (10, 0)\n   - We need to find f(5) - g(5)\n\n2. Determine the equations of both lines:\n   - For f(x), use the point-slope form or two-point form to derive the equation\n   - For g(x), use the same method to derive its equation\n\n3. Calculate the values of f(5) and g(5):\n   - Use the equations derived in step 2\n   - Substitute x = 5 into both equations\n\n4. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Subtract g(5) from f(5)\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes sense geometrically\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit. The acting agent will need to use a calculator for precise calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by determining the equations of both lines f(x) and g(x). Let's focus on f(x) first:\n\n1. For f(x), we have two points: (0, 0) and (10, 20).\n2. We can use the point-slope form of a line: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope.\n3. The slope m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (20 - 0) / (10 - 0) = 2.\n4. Using the point (0, 0), we can write the equation: y - 0 = 2(x - 0)\n5. Simplifying, we get: y = 2x or f(x) = 2x\n\nNow we have the equation for f(x). The acting agent should verify this equation using a calculator if needed, and then we can proceed to find the equation for g(x) in the next step.\n",
