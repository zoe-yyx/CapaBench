    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the structure:\n   - We have two binomial expressions being multiplied, then another set of binomials being multiplied, and these two products are being subtracted.\n\n2. Expand the first product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (2x + 6)(x - 4)\n\n3. Expand the second product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (x + 3)(2x - 6)\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   - After expanding both products, we'll have several terms. Identify and group like terms.\n\n5. Simplify:\n   - Perform the subtraction and combine like terms to get the final simplified expression.\n\n6. Check:\n   - Verify that no further simplification is possible.\n\nNote: No complex calculations are required, so a calculator shouldn't be necessary. The main focus is on algebraic manipulation and simplification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions taken, we have expanded both products using the FOIL method. The next logical step in our simplification process is to combine the expanded terms and perform the subtraction operation as indicated in the original expression.\n\nAt this point, we should have two expanded expressions:\n1. The result of (2x + 6)(x - 4)\n2. The result of (x + 3)(2x - 6)\n\nOur next step should be to subtract these expanded expressions from each other. This will involve:\n\n1. Writing out all terms from both expansions\n2. Changing the signs of all terms from the second expansion (due to subtraction)\n3. Combining like terms\n\nThis step will allow us to progress to the final stages of simplification, aligning with steps 4 and 5 of our planning strategy. After this, we'll be in a position to check if any further simplification is possible.\n",
