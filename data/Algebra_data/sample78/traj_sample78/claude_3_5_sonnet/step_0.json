Recognize the structure:\n   - We have two binomial expressions being multiplied, then another set of binomials being multiplied, and these two products are being subtracted.\n\n2. Expand the first product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (2x + 6)(x - 4)\n\n3. Expand the second product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (x + 3)(2x - 6)\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   - After expanding both products, we'll have several terms. Identify and group like terms.\n\n5. Simplify:\n   - Perform the subtraction and combine like terms to get the final simplified expression.\n\n6. Check:\n   - Verify that no further simplification is possible.\n\nNote: No complex calculations are required, so a calculator shouldn't be necessary. The main focus is on algebraic manipulation and simplification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the problem, we should begin by expanding the first product (2x + 6)(x - 4). This is a critical first step in simplifying the overall expression.\n\nTo do this, we'll use the FOIL method or distributive property:\n\n1. First terms: 2x * x = 2x^2\n2. Outer terms: 2x * (-4) = -8x\n3. Inner terms: 6 * x = 6x\n4. Last terms: 6 * (-4) = -24\n\nNow, we need to combine these terms:\n\n(2x + 6)(x - 4) = 2x^2 - 8x + 6x - 24 = 2x^2 - 2x - 24\n\nThis expansion is the first crucial step in simplifying the entire expression. The acting agent should focus on performing this expansion accurately, as it will be used in subsequent steps of the simplification process.\n",
