    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the structure:\n   - We have two binomial expressions being multiplied, then another set of binomials being multiplied, and these two products are being subtracted.\n\n2. Expand the first product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (2x + 6)(x - 4)\n\n3. Expand the second product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (x + 3)(2x - 6)\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   - After expanding both products, we'll have several terms. Identify and group like terms.\n\n5. Simplify:\n   - Perform the subtraction and combine like terms to get the final simplified expression.\n\n6. Check:\n   - Verify that no further simplification is possible.\n\nNote: No complex calculations are required, so a calculator shouldn't be necessary. The main focus is on algebraic manipulation and simplification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we have expanded the first product (2x + 6)(x - 4), our next logical step is to expand the second product (x + 3)(2x - 6). This aligns with our planning strategy, specifically step 3.\n\nExpanding the second product will give us all the terms we need to proceed with the subsequent steps of combining like terms and simplifying the expression.\n\nAfter expanding both products, we'll be in a position to perform the subtraction indicated in the original problem and combine like terms to arrive at the simplified expression.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should focus on expanding (x + 3)(2x - 6) using the FOIL method or distributive property. This will set us up for the final steps of simplification.\n",
