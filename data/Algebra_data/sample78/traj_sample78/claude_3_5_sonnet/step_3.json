    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the structure:\n   - We have two binomial expressions being multiplied, then another set of binomials being multiplied, and these two products are being subtracted.\n\n2. Expand the first product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (2x + 6)(x - 4)\n\n3. Expand the second product:\n   - Use the FOIL method or distributive property to multiply (x + 3)(2x - 6)\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   - After expanding both products, we'll have several terms. Identify and group like terms.\n\n5. Simplify:\n   - Perform the subtraction and combine like terms to get the final simplified expression.\n\n6. Check:\n   - Verify that no further simplification is possible.\n\nNote: No complex calculations are required, so a calculator shouldn't be necessary. The main focus is on algebraic manipulation and simplification.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and historical actions, it appears that we have completed the main steps of expanding both products and subtracting them. The next logical step in our reasoning process should be to focus on simplifying the resulting expression.\n\nAt this point, we should have an expression with various terms, some of which are likely to be like terms. Our reasoning should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Identify like terms in the resulting expression.\n2. Combine these like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients.\n3. Arrange the final terms in descending order of degree (typically with x^2 terms first, then x terms, and finally constant terms).\n\nThis process will lead us to the fully simplified expression, which is the goal of the original problem. After this simplification, we should be in a position to verify that no further simplification is possible, completing the final step of our plan.\n",
