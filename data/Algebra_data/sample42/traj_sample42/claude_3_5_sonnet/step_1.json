    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Sequence Sum Problem:\n\n1. Identify the sequence:\n   - First term: 45\n   - Common difference: 45\n   - Number of terms: 5\n\n2. Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n   S = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   Where:\n   S = sum of the sequence\n   n = number of terms\n   a1 = first term\n   an = last term\n\n3. Calculate the last term (5th term):\n   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Where d is the common difference\n\n4. Apply the sum formula:\n   - Substitute known values\n   - Perform the calculation\n\n5. Interpret the result:\n   - The sum will represent the total time spent playing games\n   - Ensure the units are clear (likely in minutes)\n\n6. Optional: Convert the result to hours if the sum is large\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Quick check: Is the answer reasonable given the first term and number of terms?\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 3-4 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
