    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\n2. Recall the relationship between roots and coefficients:\n   - For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a\n\n3. Compare our equation to the standard form:\n   a = 1, b = -6, c = 8\n\n4. Apply the formula for the product of roots:\n   Product of roots = c/a = 8/1 = 8\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using the quadratic formula to find the actual roots\n   - Multiply the roots to confirm the product\n\n6. Prepare the final answer: The product of the roots is 8\n\n7. If time allows, reflect on the efficiency of using the coefficient relationship versus solving for individual roots\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our comprehensive problem-solving process, we have successfully verified all aspects of the solution. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We initially used the coefficient method, which stated that for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the product of roots is c/a. In our case, c = 8 and a = 1, giving us 8 as the product of roots.\n\n2. We then used the quadratic formula to find the actual roots:\n   x1 = 4\n   x2 = 2\n\n3. We verified that both 4 and 2 are indeed roots of the original equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 by substituting them back into the equation:\n   For x = 4: 4^2 - 6(4) + 8 = 0\n   For x = 2: 2^2 - 6(2) + 8 = 0\n\n4. Finally, we calculated the product of these roots:\n   4 * 2 = 8\n\nThis final calculation confirms our initial result from the coefficient method. We have now verified the solution through two different approaches:\na) The coefficient method (theoretical)\nb) Direct calculation of roots and their product (computational)\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, providing a robust and verified solution to the original question. We can confidently conclude that the product of the roots of the equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 is 8.\n\nNo further calculations or verifications are needed. The problem has been solved completely and accurately.\n",
