    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\n2. Recall the relationship between roots and coefficients:\n   - For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a\n\n3. Compare our equation to the standard form:\n   a = 1, b = -6, c = 8\n\n4. Apply the formula for the product of roots:\n   Product of roots = c/a = 8/1 = 8\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using the quadratic formula to find the actual roots\n   - Multiply the roots to confirm the product\n\n6. Prepare the final answer: The product of the roots is 8\n\n7. If time allows, reflect on the efficiency of using the coefficient relationship versus solving for individual roots\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress so far, we have:\n\n1. Used the relationship between roots and coefficients to determine that the product of roots should be 8.\n2. Verified that b^2 - 4ac = 4 for our quadratic equation.\n3. Calculated \u221a4 = 2 as part of solving the quadratic formula.\n\nNow, we need to complete the calculation of the roots using the quadratic formula. We have:\n\nx = [6 \u00b1 \u221a4] / (2 * 1)\nx = (6 \u00b1 2) / 2\n\nThis gives us two equations:\nx1 = (6 + 2) / 2\nx2 = (6 - 2) / 2\n\nThe next logical steps are:\n\n1. Calculate x1 by adding 6 and 2, then dividing by 2.\n2. Calculate x2 by subtracting 2 from 6, then dividing by 2.\n3. Multiply x1 and x2 to verify that their product is indeed 8.\n\nThese calculations will confirm our initial result obtained through the coefficient method and provide a thorough verification of our answer.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations in sequence.\n",
