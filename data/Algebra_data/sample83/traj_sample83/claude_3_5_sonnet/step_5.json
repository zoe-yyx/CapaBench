    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\n2. Recall the relationship between roots and coefficients:\n   - For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a\n\n3. Compare our equation to the standard form:\n   a = 1, b = -6, c = 8\n\n4. Apply the formula for the product of roots:\n   Product of roots = c/a = 8/1 = 8\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using the quadratic formula to find the actual roots\n   - Multiply the roots to confirm the product\n\n6. Prepare the final answer: The product of the roots is 8\n\n7. If time allows, reflect on the efficiency of using the coefficient relationship versus solving for individual roots\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully calculated both roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 using the quadratic formula:\n\nx1 = (6 + 2) / 2 = 4\nx2 = (6 - 2) / 2 = 2\n\nNow, we need to verify two things:\n\n1. That these are indeed the roots of the original equation.\n2. That their product equals 8, as we initially calculated using the coefficient method.\n\nTo verify that 4 and 2 are the roots, we should substitute each of them back into the original equation:\n\nFor x = 4: 4^2 - 6(4) + 8 should equal 0\nFor x = 2: 2^2 - 6(2) + 8 should equal 0\n\nTo verify the product, we simply need to multiply 4 and 2, which should equal 8.\n\nThese calculations will provide a comprehensive verification of our solution, confirming both the roots themselves and their product. This will demonstrate the consistency between the coefficient method and the direct calculation of roots.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these verifications.\n",
