    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\n2. Recall the relationship between roots and coefficients:\n   - For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a\n\n3. Compare our equation to the standard form:\n   a = 1, b = -6, c = 8\n\n4. Apply the formula for the product of roots:\n   Product of roots = c/a = 8/1 = 8\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using the quadratic formula to find the actual roots\n   - Multiply the roots to confirm the product\n\n6. Prepare the final answer: The product of the roots is 8\n\n7. If time allows, reflect on the efficiency of using the coefficient relationship versus solving for individual roots\n",

We initially used the coefficient method to determine that the product of roots should be 8.\n\n2. Using the quadratic formula, we calculated the two roots:\n   x1 = 4\n   x2 = 2\n\n3. We have verified that both x1 = 4 and x2 = 2 are indeed roots of the original equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0:\n   For x1 = 4: 4^2 - 6(4) + 8 = 0\n   For x2 = 2: 2^2 - 6(2) + 8 = 0\n\nThe final step is to calculate the product of these roots to confirm our initial result:\n\n4 * 2 = 8\n\nThis calculation will provide the final verification that the product of the roots is indeed 8, as we initially determined using the coefficient method.\n\nAfter this final calculation, we will have thoroughly solved the problem using both the coefficient method and direct root calculation, providing a robust and verified solution to the original question.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this final multiplication to complete our solution.\n",
