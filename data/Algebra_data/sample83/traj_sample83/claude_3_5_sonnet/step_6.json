    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\n2. Recall the relationship between roots and coefficients:\n   - For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a\n\n3. Compare our equation to the standard form:\n   a = 1, b = -6, c = 8\n\n4. Apply the formula for the product of roots:\n   Product of roots = c/a = 8/1 = 8\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using the quadratic formula to find the actual roots\n   - Multiply the roots to confirm the product\n\n6. Prepare the final answer: The product of the roots is 8\n\n7. If time allows, reflect on the efficiency of using the coefficient relationship versus solving for individual roots\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and verifications, we have successfully found and confirmed the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0. Let's summarize our findings and determine the final steps:\n\n1. We initially used the coefficient method to determine that the product of roots should be 8.\n2. Using the quadratic formula, we calculated the two roots:\n   x1 = 4\n   x2 = 2\n3. We've just verified that x1 = 4 is indeed a root by substituting it into the original equation: 4^2 - 6(4) + 8 = 0\n\nOur next steps should be:\n\n1. Verify that x2 = 2 is also a root by substituting it into the original equation.\n2. Calculate the product of the roots (4 * 2) to confirm it equals 8.\n\nThese final calculations will complete our verification process and allow us to confidently state the product of the roots. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform these last two calculations.\n\nAfter these calculations, we will have thoroughly solved the problem using both the coefficient method and direct root calculation, providing a robust solution to the original question.\n",
