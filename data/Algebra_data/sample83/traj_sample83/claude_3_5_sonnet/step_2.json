    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\n2. Recall the relationship between roots and coefficients:\n   - For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a\n\n3. Compare our equation to the standard form:\n   a = 1, b = -6, c = 8\n\n4. Apply the formula for the product of roots:\n   Product of roots = c/a = 8/1 = 8\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using the quadratic formula to find the actual roots\n   - Multiply the roots to confirm the product\n\n6. Prepare the final answer: The product of the roots is 8\n\n7. If time allows, reflect on the efficiency of using the coefficient relationship versus solving for individual roots\n",

Calculate \u221a4\n2. Add and subtract this result from 6\n3. Divide the results by 2\n\nThis will give us the two roots of the equation. After obtaining these roots, we should multiply them to verify that their product is indeed 8, as we calculated earlier using the coefficient method.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations step by step.\n",
