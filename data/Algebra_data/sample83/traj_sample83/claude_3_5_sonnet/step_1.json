    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n\n2. Recall the relationship between roots and coefficients:\n   - For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a\n\n3. Compare our equation to the standard form:\n   a = 1, b = -6, c = 8\n\n4. Apply the formula for the product of roots:\n   Product of roots = c/a = 8/1 = 8\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Consider using the quadratic formula to find the actual roots\n   - Multiply the roots to confirm the product\n\n6. Prepare the final answer: The product of the roots is 8\n\n7. If time allows, reflect on the efficiency of using the coefficient relationship versus solving for individual roots\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we've already calculated the product of the roots using the relationship between roots and coefficients, and verified it with a calculator, our reasoning is sound. The product of the roots is indeed 8.\n\nTo further solidify our confidence in this result, we could take an additional step to verify it by finding the actual roots of the equation and multiplying them. This would serve as a thorough check of our answer.\n\nTo do this, we should use the quadratic formula to find the individual roots. The quadratic formula for an equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nFor our equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0:\na = 1\nb = -6\nc = 8\n\nLet's suggest that the acting agent use a calculator to solve this formula and find the two roots. Once we have the roots, we can multiply them to confirm that their product is indeed 8.\n",
