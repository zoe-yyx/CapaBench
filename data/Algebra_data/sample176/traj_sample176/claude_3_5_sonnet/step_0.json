    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving $(2x^3 - x + 4)(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: This is a multiplication of two polynomial expressions.\n\n2. Outline the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method for multiplying polynomials:\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial to each term of the second polynomial.\n   - Use the distributive property: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$\n\n3. Break down the multiplication into steps:\n   a. Multiply $2x^3$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   b. Multiply $-x$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   c. Multiply $4$ by each term in the second polynomial\n\n4. Combine like terms after multiplication:\n   - Group terms with the same exponent of x\n   - Add or subtract coefficients of like terms\n\n5. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Arrange terms in descending order of exponents\n   - Combine any remaining like terms\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure all terms are correctly combined\n   - Verify that the result is in standard polynomial form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct product and simplified expression within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may use a calculator for multiplying coefficients if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by applying the FOIL method to multiply these two polynomials. The first step is to distribute the first term of the first polynomial $(2x^3)$ to each term of the second polynomial $(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this multiplication:\n\n1. Multiply $2x^3$ by $3x^2$\n2. Multiply $2x^3$ by $-2x$\n3. Multiply $2x^3$ by $-5$\n\nThis will give us the first three terms of our final expression. The acting agent should use a calculator if needed to multiply the coefficients, and then combine the variables by adding their exponents.\n\nAfter this step, we'll have the first part of our expanded expression, which will form the highest degree terms in our final polynomial.\n",
