    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving $(2x^3 - x + 4)(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: This is a multiplication of two polynomial expressions.\n\n2. Outline the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method for multiplying polynomials:\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial to each term of the second polynomial.\n   - Use the distributive property: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$\n\n3. Break down the multiplication into steps:\n   a. Multiply $2x^3$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   b. Multiply $-x$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   c. Multiply $4$ by each term in the second polynomial\n\n4. Combine like terms after multiplication:\n   - Group terms with the same exponent of x\n   - Add or subtract coefficients of like terms\n\n5. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Arrange terms in descending order of exponents\n   - Combine any remaining like terms\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure all terms are correctly combined\n   - Verify that the result is in standard polynomial form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct product and simplified expression within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may use a calculator for multiplying coefficients if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the planning strategy, we've successfully distributed the first term (2x^3) and are in the process of distributing the second term (-x) of the first polynomial. We've completed two parts of this distribution:\n\n1. -x * 3x^2 = -3x^3\n2. -x * -2x = 2x^2\n\nNow, we need to complete the distribution of -x by multiplying it with the last term of the second polynomial (-5). After this, we'll have all the terms from distributing the first two terms of the first polynomial.\n\nThe next logical step is:\n\n3. Multiply -x by -5\n\nThis involves multiplying the coefficients (-1 and -5) and maintaining the exponent of x (1).\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this multiplication:\n\nCalculate -1 * -5. This will give us the coefficient for the term resulting from -x * -5.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll combine it with x^1, completing the distribution of -x to all terms of the second polynomial.\n\nOnce this is done, we'll be ready to move on to distributing the last term of the first polynomial (4) to each term of the second polynomial, which will complete our FOIL method application.\n",
