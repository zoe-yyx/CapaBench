    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving $(2x^3 - x + 4)(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: This is a multiplication of two polynomial expressions.\n\n2. Outline the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method for multiplying polynomials:\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial to each term of the second polynomial.\n   - Use the distributive property: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$\n\n3. Break down the multiplication into steps:\n   a. Multiply $2x^3$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   b. Multiply $-x$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   c. Multiply $4$ by each term in the second polynomial\n\n4. Combine like terms after multiplication:\n   - Group terms with the same exponent of x\n   - Add or subtract coefficients of like terms\n\n5. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Arrange terms in descending order of exponents\n   - Combine any remaining like terms\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure all terms are correctly combined\n   - Verify that the result is in standard polynomial form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct product and simplified expression within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may use a calculator for multiplying coefficients if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the planning strategy, we have almost completed the distribution of all terms in the first polynomial to all terms in the second polynomial. Let's summarize our current terms:\n\nFrom 2x^3 distribution:\n1. 6x^5\n2. -4x^4\n3. -10x^3\n\nFrom -x distribution:\n4. -3x^3\n5. 2x^2\n6. 5x\n\nFrom 4 distribution (so far):\n7. 12x^2\n8. -8x\n\nWe have one last multiplication to complete the FOIL method:\n\n9. Multiply 4 by -5\n\nThis will give us the constant term in our final expression. After this, we will have all the terms resulting from the multiplication of the two polynomials.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this final multiplication:\n\nCalculate 4 * (-5). This will give us the constant term in our expanded expression.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have all the terms from our FOIL method application. The next phase will involve combining like terms and simplifying the resulting polynomial. We should be prepared to guide the acting agent through the process of identifying like terms and adding their coefficients in the next steps.\n",
