    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving $(2x^3 - x + 4)(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: This is a multiplication of two polynomial expressions.\n\n2. Outline the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method for multiplying polynomials:\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial to each term of the second polynomial.\n   - Use the distributive property: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$\n\n3. Break down the multiplication into steps:\n   a. Multiply $2x^3$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   b. Multiply $-x$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   c. Multiply $4$ by each term in the second polynomial\n\n4. Combine like terms after multiplication:\n   - Group terms with the same exponent of x\n   - Add or subtract coefficients of like terms\n\n5. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Arrange terms in descending order of exponents\n   - Combine any remaining like terms\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure all terms are correctly combined\n   - Verify that the result is in standard polynomial form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct product and simplified expression within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may use a calculator for multiplying coefficients if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the planning strategy, we have successfully distributed the first two terms of the first polynomial and have begun distributing the last term (4). We've just calculated 4 * 3, which gives us 12 as the coefficient for the term 12x^2.\n\nNow, we need to continue with the distribution of the constant term 4. The next steps should be:\n\n1. Complete the multiplication of 4 by 3x^2:\n   We have 12 as the coefficient, and we maintain the x^2.\n   This gives us 12x^2.\n\n2. Proceed with multiplying 4 by -2x:\n   This involves multiplying 4 by -2 and maintaining the x.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the multiplication of 4 and -2:\n\nCalculate 4 * (-2). This will give us the coefficient for the term resulting from 4 * (-2x).\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll combine it with x, and then move on to the last part of distributing 4, which will be multiplying 4 by -5.\n\nOnce we complete these steps, we will have all the terms from our FOIL method application. The next phase will involve combining like terms and simplifying the resulting polynomial.\n",
