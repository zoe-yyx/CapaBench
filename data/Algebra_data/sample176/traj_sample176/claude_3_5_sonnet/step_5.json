    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving $(2x^3 - x + 4)(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: This is a multiplication of two polynomial expressions.\n\n2. Outline the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method for multiplying polynomials:\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial to each term of the second polynomial.\n   - Use the distributive property: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$\n\n3. Break down the multiplication into steps:\n   a. Multiply $2x^3$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   b. Multiply $-x$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   c. Multiply $4$ by each term in the second polynomial\n\n4. Combine like terms after multiplication:\n   - Group terms with the same exponent of x\n   - Add or subtract coefficients of like terms\n\n5. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Arrange terms in descending order of exponents\n   - Combine any remaining like terms\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure all terms are correctly combined\n   - Verify that the result is in standard polynomial form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct product and simplified expression within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may use a calculator for multiplying coefficients if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and current progress, we have completed the distribution of the first term (2x^3) and started the distribution of the second term (-x) of the first polynomial. We have just calculated -1 * 3 for the first part of distributing -x to 3x^2.\n\nNow, we need to continue with the multiplication process. The next steps should be:\n\n1. Complete the multiplication of -x by 3x^2:\n   We have -3 as the coefficient, and we need to add the exponents (1 + 2 = 3).\n   This gives us -3x^3.\n\n2. Proceed with multiplying -x by -2x:\n   This involves multiplying the coefficients (-1 and -2) and adding the exponents of x (1 and 1).\n   \nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the multiplication of the coefficients for -x * -2x:\n\nCalculate -1 * -2. This will give us the coefficient for the term resulting from -x * -2x.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll combine it with x^2 (since 1 + 1 = 2 for the exponents), and then move on to the last part of distributing -x.\n",
