    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving $(2x^3 - x + 4)(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: This is a multiplication of two polynomial expressions.\n\n2. Outline the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method for multiplying polynomials:\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial to each term of the second polynomial.\n   - Use the distributive property: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$\n\n3. Break down the multiplication into steps:\n   a. Multiply $2x^3$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   b. Multiply $-x$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   c. Multiply $4$ by each term in the second polynomial\n\n4. Combine like terms after multiplication:\n   - Group terms with the same exponent of x\n   - Add or subtract coefficients of like terms\n\n5. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Arrange terms in descending order of exponents\n   - Combine any remaining like terms\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure all terms are correctly combined\n   - Verify that the result is in standard polynomial form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct product and simplified expression within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may use a calculator for multiplying coefficients if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we have successfully completed the first part of the multiplication process. We've multiplied the first term of the first polynomial $(2x^3)$ by the first term of the second polynomial $(3x^2)$, resulting in $6x^5$.\n\nNow, we need to continue with the FOIL method by multiplying $2x^3$ by the remaining terms of the second polynomial. Our next steps should be:\n\n1. Multiply $2x^3$ by $-2x$\n2. Multiply $2x^3$ by $-5$\n\nThese calculations will complete the distribution of the first term $(2x^3)$ to all terms in the second polynomial. \n\nAfter these steps, we'll have the first three terms of our expanded expression. Once we have these terms, we can move on to distributing the second term of the first polynomial $(-x)$ to each term of the second polynomial.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the next multiplication:\n\nCalculate $2x^3 \\times (-2x)$. This involves multiplying the coefficients (2 and -2) and adding the exponents of x (3 and 1).\n",
