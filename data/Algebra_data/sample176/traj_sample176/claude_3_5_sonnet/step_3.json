    "planning_context": "\nPlan for solving $(2x^3 - x + 4)(3x^2 - 2x - 5)$:\n\n1. Identify the problem: This is a multiplication of two polynomial expressions.\n\n2. Outline the FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) method for multiplying polynomials:\n   - Distribute each term of the first polynomial to each term of the second polynomial.\n   - Use the distributive property: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$\n\n3. Break down the multiplication into steps:\n   a. Multiply $2x^3$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   b. Multiply $-x$ by each term in the second polynomial\n   c. Multiply $4$ by each term in the second polynomial\n\n4. Combine like terms after multiplication:\n   - Group terms with the same exponent of x\n   - Add or subtract coefficients of like terms\n\n5. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Arrange terms in descending order of exponents\n   - Combine any remaining like terms\n\n6. Final check:\n   - Ensure all terms are correctly combined\n   - Verify that the result is in standard polynomial form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct product and simplified expression within the 10-round limit. The acting agent may use a calculator for multiplying coefficients if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully completed the multiplication of the first term of the first polynomial (2x^3) with the first two terms of the second polynomial (3x^2 and -2x). We now have 6x^5 and -4x^4 as the first two terms of our expanded expression.\n\nThe next logical step is to complete the distribution of 2x^3 by multiplying it with the last term of the second polynomial (-5). This will finalize the first part of the FOIL method.\n\nAfter this, we'll move on to distributing the second term of the first polynomial (-x) to each term of the second polynomial (3x^2 - 2x - 5).\n\nFor now, let's guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Multiply 2x^3 by -5\n2. This involves multiplying the coefficients (2 and -5) and maintaining the exponent of x (3)\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to multiply 2 and -5, and then combine the result with x^3.\n",
