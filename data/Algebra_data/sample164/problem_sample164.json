    "solution": "Let $P$ be the initial amount the student deposits. After 10 years, with a compound interest rate of 5% per year, the total amount will be $P \\cdot 1.05^{10}$. To reach her goal of $50000, $P$ must satisfy \\[P = \\frac{50000}{1.05^{10}} = \\boxed{30695.66},\\] rounded to the nearest dollar.",
