Consider possible cases:\n   - Case 1: Both terms positive\n   - Case 2: First term positive, second term negative\n   - Case 3: First term negative, second term positive\n   - Case 4: Both terms negative\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting equation\n   - This will likely involve algebraic manipulation and possibly quadratic equations\n\n4. Verify solutions:\n   - Check each solution in the original equation to ensure it's valid\n   - Discard any solutions that don't satisfy the original equation\n\n5. Sum the valid solutions:\n   - Add up all the real values of x that were found and verified\n\n6. Final answer:\n   - Present the sum of all real values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nNote: We may need to use a calculator for more complex arithmetic or algebraic simplifications. If we encounter any unfamiliar mathematical concepts or techniques, we can use a search engine to look them up.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this equation, we need to consider the different cases mentioned in the planning strategy. Let's start with Case 1, where both terms are positive.\n\nCase 1: Both terms positive\nThis means:\n3x - 6 \u2265 0 and x + 2 \u2265 0\n\nWe can rewrite the equation without absolute value signs:\n(3x - 6) - (x + 2) = 12\n\nNow we should solve this equation:\n3x - 6 - x - 2 = 12\n2x - 8 = 12\n2x = 20\nx = 10\n\nWe need to verify if x = 10 satisfies both initial inequalities:\n3(10) - 6 \u2265 0 : 24 \u2265 0 (true)\n10 + 2 \u2265 0 : 12 \u2265 0 (true)\n\nSo x = 10 is a valid solution for Case 1.\n\nNext, we should proceed to analyze Case 2, where the first term is positive and the second term is negative. This will help us find all possible solutions before we can sum them up.\n",
