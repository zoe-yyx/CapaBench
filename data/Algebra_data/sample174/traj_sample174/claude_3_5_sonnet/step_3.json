    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation:\n   - Identify the two absolute value terms: |3x - 6| and |x + 2|\n   - Note that these are separated by subtraction and equal to 12\n\n2. Consider possible cases:\n   - Case 1: Both terms positive\n   - Case 2: First term positive, second term negative\n   - Case 3: First term negative, second term positive\n   - Case 4: Both terms negative\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting equation\n   - This will likely involve algebraic manipulation and possibly quadratic equations\n\n4. Verify solutions:\n   - Check each solution in the original equation to ensure it's valid\n   - Discard any solutions that don't satisfy the original equation\n\n5. Sum the valid solutions:\n   - Add up all the real values of x that were found and verified\n\n6. Final answer:\n   - Present the sum of all real values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nNote: We may need to use a calculator for more complex arithmetic or algebraic simplifications. If we encounter any unfamiliar mathematical concepts or techniques, we can use a search engine to look them up.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we've already analyzed Cases 2 and 3, and started solving Case 1. Let's continue with solving Case 1 and then move on to Case 4.\n\nFor Case 1 (both terms positive):\n1. Remove the absolute value signs: (3x - 6) - (x + 2) = 12\n2. Simplify: 2x - 8 = 12\n3. Solve for x: 2x = 20, x = 10\n\nNow, we need to verify if this solution satisfies the original equation:\n|3(10) - 6| - |10 + 2| = |24| - |12| = 24 - 12 = 12\n\nThis solution is valid for Case 1.\n\nNext, we should proceed with Case 4 (both terms negative):\n1. Remove the absolute value signs and change the signs: -(3x - 6) - -(x + 2) = 12\n2. Simplify: -3x + 6 + x + 2 = 12\n3. Combine like terms: -2x + 8 = 12\n4. Solve for x: -2x = 4, x = -2\n\nWe should verify this solution as well:\n|3(-2) - 6| - |(-2) + 2| = |-6 - 6| - |0| = 12 - 0 = 12\n\nThis solution is also valid.\n\nAfter solving all cases, we have found two valid solutions: x = 10 and x = -2.\n\nThe final step is to sum these solutions: 10 + (-2) = 8\n\nTherefore, the sum of all real values of x that satisfy the equation is 8.\n",
