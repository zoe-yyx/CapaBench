Consider possible cases:\n   - Case 1: Both terms positive\n   - Case 2: First term positive, second term negative\n   - Case 3: First term negative, second term positive\n   - Case 4: Both terms negative\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting equation\n   - This will likely involve algebraic manipulation and possibly quadratic equations\n\n4. Verify solutions:\n   - Check each solution in the original equation to ensure it's valid\n   - Discard any solutions that don't satisfy the original equation\n\n5. Sum the valid solutions:\n   - Add up all the real values of x that were found and verified\n\n6. Final answer:\n   - Present the sum of all real values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nNote: We may need to use a calculator for more complex arithmetic or algebraic simplifications. If we encounter any unfamiliar mathematical concepts or techniques, we can use a search engine to look them up.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we should now focus on Case 2 where the first term is positive and the second term is negative. Let's reason through this case:\n\n1. For Case 2, we assume:\n   3x - 6 \u2265 0 and x + 2 < 0\n\n2. Under these conditions, our equation becomes:\n   (3x - 6) - (-(x + 2)) = 12\n\n3. Let's simplify this:\n   (3x - 6) + (x + 2) = 12\n   4x - 4 = 12\n   4x = 16\n   x = 4\n\n4. Now we need to verify if x = 4 satisfies our initial assumptions:\n   - For 3x - 6 \u2265 0: 3(4) - 6 = 6 \u2265 0 (True)\n   - For x + 2 < 0: 4 + 2 = 6 < 0 (False)\n\n5. Since x = 4 doesn't satisfy both conditions, it's not a valid solution for Case 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Case 2 doesn't yield any valid solutions. We should move on to analyze the next case, which is Case 3 where the first term is negative and the second term is positive.\n",
