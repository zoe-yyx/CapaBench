    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the equation:\n   - Identify the two absolute value terms: |3x - 6| and |x + 2|\n   - Note that these are separated by subtraction and equal to 12\n\n2. Consider possible cases:\n   - Case 1: Both terms positive\n   - Case 2: First term positive, second term negative\n   - Case 3: First term negative, second term positive\n   - Case 4: Both terms negative\n\n3. Solve each case:\n   - For each case, remove the absolute value signs and solve the resulting equation\n   - This will likely involve algebraic manipulation and possibly quadratic equations\n\n4. Verify solutions:\n   - Check each solution in the original equation to ensure it's valid\n   - Discard any solutions that don't satisfy the original equation\n\n5. Sum the valid solutions:\n   - Add up all the real values of x that were found and verified\n\n6. Final answer:\n   - Present the sum of all real values of x that satisfy the equation\n\nNote: We may need to use a calculator for more complex arithmetic or algebraic simplifications. If we encounter any unfamiliar mathematical concepts or techniques, we can use a search engine to look them up.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have analyzed Cases 2 and 3, where one term is positive and the other is negative. To complete our analysis, we should now focus on the remaining cases:\n\n1. Case 1: Both terms positive\n2. Case 4: Both terms negative\n\nLet's start with Case 1, where both terms are positive. This means:\n\n|3x - 6| - |x + 2| = 12\n(3x - 6) - (x + 2) = 12\n\nThis case will give us a linear equation to solve. After solving, we'll need to verify if the solution satisfies the conditions for this case (both terms being positive).\n\nAfter analyzing Case 1, we'll move on to Case 4, where both terms are negative. This will complete our case analysis.\n\nOnce all cases are analyzed, we can collect all valid solutions, verify them in the original equation, and then sum them to get our final answer.\n",
