    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - We have a line segment with two endpoints: (-3, 2) and (5, 8)\n   - We need to find the midpoint of this line segment\n   - We then need to sum the coordinates of the midpoint\n\n2. Recall the midpoint formula:\n   - The midpoint formula is: ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n   - Where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the endpoints\n\n3. Apply the midpoint formula:\n   - Calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint: (-3 + 5) / 2\n   - Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint: (2 + 8) / 2\n\n4. Perform the calculations:\n   - Use a calculator if needed for precise results\n\n5. Identify the midpoint coordinates\n\n6. Sum the coordinates of the midpoint:\n   - Add the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the midpoint\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of the coordinates of the midpoint\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by applying the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the midpoint. Let's guide the acting agent to calculate the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the midpoint separately.\n\nFor the x-coordinate:\nWe need to add the x-coordinates of the two endpoints (-3 and 5) and divide by 2.\nThe calculation would be: (-3 + 5) / 2\n\nFor the y-coordinate:\nWe need to add the y-coordinates of the two endpoints (2 and 8) and divide by 2.\nThe calculation would be: (2 + 8) / 2\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform these calculations using a calculator to ensure accuracy. Once we have the midpoint coordinates, we can proceed to sum them in the next step.\n",
