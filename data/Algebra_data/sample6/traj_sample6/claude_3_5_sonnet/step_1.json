    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - We have a line segment with two endpoints: (-3, 2) and (5, 8)\n   - We need to find the midpoint of this line segment\n   - We then need to sum the coordinates of the midpoint\n\n2. Recall the midpoint formula:\n   - The midpoint formula is: ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n   - Where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the endpoints\n\n3. Apply the midpoint formula:\n   - Calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint: (-3 + 5) / 2\n   - Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint: (2 + 8) / 2\n\n4. Perform the calculations:\n   - Use a calculator if needed for precise results\n\n5. Identify the midpoint coordinates\n\n6. Sum the coordinates of the midpoint:\n   - Add the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the midpoint\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - The sum of the coordinates of the midpoint\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the planning strategy, we have successfully calculated the x-coordinate of the midpoint, which is 1. Now, we need to proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint using the formula (y1 + y2) / 2.\n2. Once we have both coordinates of the midpoint, we can sum them to get our final answer.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint. We need to use the calculator to compute (2 + 8) / 2, as these are the y-coordinates of the given endpoints.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have both coordinates of the midpoint, allowing us to move to the final step of summing these coordinates in the next action.\n",
