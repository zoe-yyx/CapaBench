    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving $9^{y-1} = 81^2$:\n\n1. Simplify the right side of the equation:\n   - Calculate 81^2 using the calculator\n\n2. Recognize the relationship between 9 and 81:\n   - Note that 81 = 9^2\n\n3. Rewrite the equation using the same base:\n   - Express both sides with base 9\n\n4. Apply the laws of exponents:\n   - Use the property (a^m)^n = a^(m*n)\n\n5. Simplify the exponents:\n   - Combine like terms on both sides of the equation\n\n6. Solve for y:\n   - Isolate y on one side of the equation\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of y back into the original equation\n\n8. Round the answer if necessary:\n   - Check if the solution needs to be expressed in a specific format\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for computations and focusing on the properties of exponents to simplify and solve the equation efficiently.\n",
