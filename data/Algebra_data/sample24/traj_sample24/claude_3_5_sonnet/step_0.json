    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |x - 5| \u2265 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality: |x - 5| \u2265 9\n   - We need to find the larger endpoint of the solution set\n\n2. Recall the absolute value inequality properties:\n   - For |a| \u2265 b (where b is non-negative), the solution is a \u2265 b or a \u2264 -b\n\n3. Apply the property to our inequality:\n   - Rewrite as two separate inequalities:\n     (x - 5) \u2265 9 or (x - 5) \u2264 -9\n\n4. Solve each inequality:\n   - For (x - 5) \u2265 9:\n     Add 5 to both sides: x \u2265 14\n   - For (x - 5) \u2264 -9:\n     Add 5 to both sides: x \u2264 -4\n\n5. Identify the solution set:\n   - The solution is x \u2264 -4 or x \u2265 14\n\n6. Determine the larger endpoint:\n   - Compare -4 and 14\n   - The larger value is 14\n\n7. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if 14 satisfies the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The larger endpoint value in the solution set is 14\n\nThis plan should allow the following agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by applying the absolute value inequality property to our given inequality |x - 5| \u2265 9. This is a crucial step in solving the problem.\n\nThe absolute value inequality |a| \u2265 b (where b is non-negative) can be rewritten as two separate inequalities: a \u2265 b or a \u2264 -b.\n\nIn our case, |x - 5| \u2265 9 can be rewritten as:\n(x - 5) \u2265 9 or (x - 5) \u2264 -9\n\nThis step allows us to remove the absolute value sign and work with standard inequalities. From here, we can solve each inequality separately to find the solution set.\n\nThe next logical step would be to solve these inequalities by isolating x on one side. This will give us the range of values that satisfy the original inequality.\n",
