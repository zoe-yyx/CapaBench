    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |x - 5| \u2265 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality: |x - 5| \u2265 9\n   - We need to find the larger endpoint of the solution set\n\n2. Recall the absolute value inequality properties:\n   - For |a| \u2265 b (where b is non-negative), the solution is a \u2265 b or a \u2264 -b\n\n3. Apply the property to our inequality:\n   - Rewrite as two separate inequalities:\n     (x - 5) \u2265 9 or (x - 5) \u2264 -9\n\n4. Solve each inequality:\n   - For (x - 5) \u2265 9:\n     Add 5 to both sides: x \u2265 14\n   - For (x - 5) \u2264 -9:\n     Add 5 to both sides: x \u2264 -4\n\n5. Identify the solution set:\n   - The solution is x \u2264 -4 or x \u2265 14\n\n6. Determine the larger endpoint:\n   - Compare -4 and 14\n   - The larger value is 14\n\n7. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if 14 satisfies the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The larger endpoint value in the solution set is 14\n\nThis plan should allow the following agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the previous action of solving the inequalities, we should now focus on interpreting the results of those solved inequalities. The next logical step in our reasoning process is:\n\n1. Interpret the solutions of the inequalities:\n   - For (x - 5) \u2265 9, we should have obtained x \u2265 14\n   - For (x - 5) \u2264 -9, we should have obtained x \u2264 -4\n\n2. Combine these results to form the complete solution set:\n   The solution set is x \u2264 -4 or x \u2265 14\n\n3. Identify the endpoints of this solution set:\n   The two endpoints are -4 and 14\n\n4. Compare the endpoints to determine the larger one:\n   14 is clearly larger than -4\n\nTherefore, our reasoning leads us to conclude that 14 is the larger endpoint value in the solution set. The next action should be to verify this result by checking if 14 satisfies the original inequality |x - 5| \u2265 9.\n",
