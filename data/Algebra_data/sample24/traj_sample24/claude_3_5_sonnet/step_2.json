    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Inequality |x - 5| \u2265 9\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We're dealing with an absolute value inequality: |x - 5| \u2265 9\n   - We need to find the larger endpoint of the solution set\n\n2. Recall the absolute value inequality properties:\n   - For |a| \u2265 b (where b is non-negative), the solution is a \u2265 b or a \u2264 -b\n\n3. Apply the property to our inequality:\n   - Rewrite as two separate inequalities:\n     (x - 5) \u2265 9 or (x - 5) \u2264 -9\n\n4. Solve each inequality:\n   - For (x - 5) \u2265 9:\n     Add 5 to both sides: x \u2265 14\n   - For (x - 5) \u2264 -9:\n     Add 5 to both sides: x \u2264 -4\n\n5. Identify the solution set:\n   - The solution is x \u2264 -4 or x \u2265 14\n\n6. Determine the larger endpoint:\n   - Compare -4 and 14\n   - The larger value is 14\n\n7. Verify the answer:\n   - Check if 14 satisfies the original inequality\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The larger endpoint value in the solution set is 14\n\nThis plan should allow the following agents to solve the problem efficiently within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe've successfully solved the inequalities, identified the solution set, and determined that 14 is the larger endpoint. We've also verified that 14 satisfies the original inequality |x - 5| \u2265 9 using a calculator.\n\nAt this point, we have effectively completed all the necessary steps to solve the problem. The larger endpoint value in the solution set has been identified as 14, and this result has been verified.\n\nGiven that we have reached our goal, the next logical step would be to formulate a concise final answer that directly addresses the original question. This will ensure that we have a clear and definitive response to the problem statement.\n",
