    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Principal (P) = $8000\n   - Annual interest rate (r) = 8% = 0.08\n   - Time (t) = 8 years\n   - Compounding frequency = annually\n\n2. Recall the compound interest formula:\n   A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where A is the final amount\n\n3. Substitute the known values into the formula:\n   A = 8000(1 + 0.08)^8\n\n4. Calculate the result:\n   a. Calculate (1 + 0.08)^8 using a calculator\n   b. Multiply the result by 8000\n\n5. Round the final answer to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Present the answer in the format: $X,XXX.XX\n\n7. Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy\n\n8. Reflect on the result to ensure it makes sense given the initial investment and interest rate\n",
