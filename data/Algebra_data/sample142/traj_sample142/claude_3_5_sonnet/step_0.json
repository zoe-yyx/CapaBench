    "observation": "Leona invested $\\$8000$ in a savings account that compounds annually at a rate of $8\\%$. How much total money will she have after 8 years? Give the answer in decimal and round to 2 decimal places",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Principal (P) = $8000\n   - Annual interest rate (r) = 8% = 0.08\n   - Time (t) = 8 years\n   - Compounding frequency = annually\n\n2. Recall the compound interest formula:\n   A = P(1 + r)^t\n   Where A is the final amount\n\n3. Substitute the known values into the formula:\n   A = 8000(1 + 0.08)^8\n\n4. Calculate the result:\n   a. Calculate (1 + 0.08)^8 using a calculator\n   b. Multiply the result by 8000\n\n5. Round the final answer to 2 decimal places\n\n6. Present the answer in the format: $X,XXX.XX\n\n7. Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy\n\n8. Reflect on the result to ensure it makes sense given the initial investment and interest rate\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the given problem, our next step is to begin the calculation process. We need to use the compound interest formula A = P(1 + r)^t, where we have all the necessary values:\n\nP = $8000 (principal)\nr = 0.08 (8% annual interest rate)\nt = 8 years\n\nThe first critical calculation we need to perform is (1 + 0.08)^8. This will give us the growth factor over the 8-year period. Once we have this result, we can multiply it by the principal to get the final amount.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use a calculator to compute (1 + 0.08)^8. This calculation is crucial as it forms the basis for determining the total growth of Leona's investment over the 8-year period.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be ready to multiply the result by the principal amount to get the final value of the investment.\n",
