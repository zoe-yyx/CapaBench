    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem type:\n   This is a partial fraction decomposition problem.\n\n2. Understand the given equation:\n   Left side: (3x-6) / (x^2-7x+12)\n   Right side: C/(x-3) + D/(x-4)\n\n3. Recognize the form of the denominator:\n   x^2-7x+12 = (x-3)(x-4)\n\n4. Plan the solution approach:\n   a) Find a common denominator on the right side\n   b) Multiply both sides by (x-3)(x-4)\n   c) Simplify and equate coefficients\n\n5. Solve for C and D:\n   a) Set up a system of equations\n   b) Solve the system\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   Substitute the found values back into the original equation\n\n7. Present the answer:\n   Express the solution as an ordered pair (C, D)\n\nNote: The acting agent may need to use a calculator for arithmetic operations and equation solving.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by finding a common denominator on the right side of the equation. The common denominator will be (x-3)(x-4), which is already the denominator of the left side.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply both sides of the equation by (x-3)(x-4):\n\n   (3x-6) = C(x-4) + D(x-3)\n\n2. Expand the right side:\n\n   (3x-6) = Cx - 4C + Dx - 3D\n\n3. Combine like terms on the right side:\n\n   (3x-6) = (C+D)x - 4C - 3D\n\n4. Now, we can equate the coefficients of x and the constant terms on both sides:\n\n   Coefficient of x: 3 = C + D\n   Constant term: -6 = -4C - 3D\n\nThese two equations will allow us to solve for C and D. The acting agent should set up this system of equations and solve it, possibly using a calculator if needed.\n",
