    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem type:\n   This is a partial fraction decomposition problem.\n\n2. Understand the given equation:\n   Left side: (3x-6) / (x^2-7x+12)\n   Right side: C/(x-3) + D/(x-4)\n\n3. Recognize the form of the denominator:\n   x^2-7x+12 = (x-3)(x-4)\n\n4. Plan the solution approach:\n   a) Find a common denominator on the right side\n   b) Multiply both sides by (x-3)(x-4)\n   c) Simplify and equate coefficients\n\n5. Solve for C and D:\n   a) Set up a system of equations\n   b) Solve the system\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   Substitute the found values back into the original equation\n\n7. Present the answer:\n   Express the solution as an ordered pair (C, D)\n\nNote: The acting agent may need to use a calculator for arithmetic operations and equation solving.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we should proceed with setting up and solving the system of equations to find C and D. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to multiply both sides of the original equation by (x-3)(x-4) to eliminate the denominators.\n\n2. After multiplication, the left side will become 3x-6, and the right side will be C(x-4) + D(x-3).\n\n3. Expanding the right side, we get: Cx - 4C + Dx - 3D = 3x - 6\n\n4. Collecting like terms: (C+D)x - 4C - 3D = 3x - 6\n\n5. For this equation to be true for all x, the coefficients of x on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must also be equal. This gives us two equations:\n\n   C + D = 3\n   -4C - 3D = -6\n\n6. These two equations form our system of equations that we need to solve to find C and D.\n\nThe acting agent should now proceed to solve this system of equations, either by substitution, elimination, or using a calculator if needed.\n",
