    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have combined like terms in the polynomial p(x), we need to analyze the coefficients of each degree. This will help us set up the equations necessary to determine the value of c.\n\nLet's break down the polynomial after combining like terms:\n\np(x) = (2x\u00b3 + 3x\u00b2 - cx + 7) + (cx\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3 + 5x - 3)\n     = (2x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b3) + (3x\u00b2 + cx\u00b2) + (-cx + 5x) + (7 - 3)\n     = 0x\u00b3 + (3+c)x\u00b2 + (5-c)x + 4\n\nFor p(x) to have a degree of 1, the coefficients of x\u00b3 and x\u00b2 must be zero. We can see that the x\u00b3 term is already zero, so we need to focus on the x\u00b2 term.\n\nThe coefficient of x\u00b2 is (3+c), and this must equal zero for p(x) to have a degree of 1.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to set up the equation:\n\n3 + c = 0\n\nThis equation will allow us to solve for c and determine its value that makes the polynomial have a degree of 1.\n",
