    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have substituted c = -3 into the original polynomial, we need to simplify it to verify that the resulting polynomial indeed has a degree of 1. This step is crucial to confirm our solution.\n\nLet's break down the substitution and simplification process:\n\n1. In the first part of the polynomial: (2x\u00b3 + 3x\u00b2 - cx + 7)\n   Substituting c = -3, we get: (2x\u00b3 + 3x\u00b2 - (-3)x + 7) = (2x\u00b3 + 3x\u00b2 + 3x + 7)\n\n2. In the second part of the polynomial: (cx\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3 + 5x - 3)\n   Substituting c = -3, we get: (-3x\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3 + 5x - 3)\n\n3. Now we need to combine these parts and simplify:\n   (2x\u00b3 + 3x\u00b2 + 3x + 7) + (-3x\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3 + 5x - 3)\n\n   Grouping like terms:\n   (2x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b3) + (3x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2) + (3x + 5x) + (7 - 3)\n\n   Simplifying:\n   0x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 + 8x + 4\n\nThe next logical step is to confirm that this simplified polynomial has a degree of 1. We should instruct the acting agent to verify this final form of the polynomial.\n",
