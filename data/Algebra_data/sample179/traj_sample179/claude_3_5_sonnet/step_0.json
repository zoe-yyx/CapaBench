    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, our first step should be to analyze the given polynomial by combining like terms. This will help us identify the coefficients of each degree, which is crucial for determining the condition that will make the polynomial have a degree of 1.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to combine like terms in the polynomial p(x) = (2x^3 + 3x^2 - cx + 7) + (cx^2 - 2x^3 + 5x - 3).\n\nWe should focus on:\n1. Combining the x\u00b3 terms: 2x^3 and -2x^3\n2. Combining the x\u00b2 terms: 3x^2 and cx^2\n3. Combining the x terms: -cx and 5x\n4. Combining the constant terms: 7 and -3\n\nThis operation will give us a simplified form of the polynomial, which will make it easier to set up the equations needed to solve for c in the next steps.\n",
