    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress, we have successfully combined like terms and identified the equation that will determine the value of c. The next logical step in our reasoning process is to solve this equation for c.\n\nFrom the previous action, we have the equation:\n\n3 + c = 0\n\nTo solve for c, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:\n\nc = -3\n\nThis value of c should make the coefficient of x\u00b2 equal to zero, which is what we need for the polynomial to have a degree of 1.\n\nOur next step should be to verify this solution by substituting c = -3 back into the original polynomial. This will allow us to confirm that the resulting polynomial indeed has a degree of 1.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should substitute c = -3 into the original polynomial:\n\np(x) = (2x\u00b3 + 3x\u00b2 - cx + 7) + (cx\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3 + 5x - 3)\n\nand simplify it to check if all terms with degree higher than 1 cancel out.\n",
