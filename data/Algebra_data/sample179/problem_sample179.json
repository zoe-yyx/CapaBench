    "problem": "Determine the value of $c$ so that the polynomial $p(x) = (2x^3 + 3x^2 - cx + 7) + (cx^2 - 2x^3 + 5x - 3)$ has a degree of 1.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Combining like terms, the polynomial $p(x)$ simplifies to $(2x^3 - 2x^3) + (3x^2 + cx^2) - cx + (5x) + (7 - 3)$. Simplifying further, we get $(3+c)x^2 + (5-c)x + 4$. For $p(x)$ to have a degree of 1, the $x^2$ term must cancel out, meaning $3+c=0$. Thus, $c = -3$. Therefore, $p(x) = 2x + 4$, confirming that the degree is indeed 1. The correct value of $c$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",
