    "reasoning": "\nTo begin simplifying this complex nested radical expression, we should start from the innermost radical and work our way outward. Let's analyze the structure:\n\n$\\root 4 \\of {x \\root 4 \\of {x \\root 4 \\of {x \\root 4 \\of {x}}}}$\n\n1. The innermost radical is $\\root 4 \\of {x}$. This can be written as $x^{1/4}$.\n\n2. Moving outward, the next layer becomes $\\root 4 \\of {x \\cdot x^{1/4}}$, which is equivalent to $\\root 4 \\of {x^{1+1/4}}$ or $\\root 4 \\of {x^{5/4}}$.\n\n3. We can simplify this using the property $\\root n \\of {a^m} = a^{m/n}$. So, $\\root 4 \\of {x^{5/4}} = x^{(5/4)/4} = x^{5/16}$.\n\n4. Continuing this process for the next layer, we'll have $\\root 4 \\of {x \\cdot x^{5/16}}$, which is $\\root 4 \\of {x^{1+5/16}} = \\root 4 \\of {x^{21/16}}$.\n\n5. Again, simplifying: $\\root 4 \\of {x^{21/16}} = x^{(21/16)/4} = x^{21/64}$.\n\n6. For the final, outermost layer: $\\root 4 \\of {x \\cdot x^{21/64}}$, which is $\\root 4 \\of {x^{1+21/64}} = \\root 4 \\of {x^{85/64}}$.\n\n7. The final simplification: $\\root 4 \\of {x^{85/64}} = x^{(85/64)/4} = x^{85/256}$.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to calculate these exponents and simplify the expression layer by layer as described above.\n",
