    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the problem:\n   - We have the equation of a circle in general form: x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 6y + 9 = 0\n   - We need to find the radius of this circle\n\n2. Recall the standard form of a circle equation:\n   - (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n   - Where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius\n\n3. Convert the given equation to standard form:\n   - Group x terms, y terms, and constants\n   - Complete the square for both x and y\n\n4. Identify the center and radius:\n   - After completing the square, the equation will be in the form:\n     (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n   - The center will be (h, k)\n   - The right side of the equation will give us r^2\n\n5. Calculate the radius:\n   - Take the square root of r^2\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Substitute the center coordinates and radius back into the original equation to check\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the radius of the circle\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by converting the given equation to standard form. This involves grouping the terms and completing the square for both x and y. Let's guide the acting agent through this process:\n\n1. First, we need to group the x terms, y terms, and constants:\n   (x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 + 6y) + 9 = 0\n\n2. Now, we need to complete the square for both x and y terms. To do this, we need to:\n   a) Halve the coefficient of x and y\n   b) Square these halved coefficients\n   c) Add and subtract these squared terms to maintain equality\n\n   For x: half of -4 is -2, and (-2)^2 = 4\n   For y: half of 6 is 3, and 3^2 = 9\n\n3. The next step would be to rewrite the equation as:\n   (x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) + 9 - 4 - 9 = 0\n\n4. This can be factored as:\n   (x - 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 4\n\nNow we have the equation in standard form (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where:\n- The center is (h, k) = (2, -3)\n- r^2 = 4\n\nTo find the radius, we need to take the square root of 4.\n\nThe acting agent should now use a calculator to compute the square root of 4 to find the radius.\n",
