    "problem": "Given the equation of a circle $x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 6y + 9 = 0$, find the radius of the circle.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we complete the square for both $x$ and $y$. Rewriting, we have $x^2 - 4x + y^2 + 6y = -9$. Completing the square gives $(x-2)^2 - 4 + (y+3)^2 - 9 = -9$. Simplifying, we find $(x-2)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 4$, which is a circle with center $(2, -3)$ and radius $\\boxed{2}$.",
