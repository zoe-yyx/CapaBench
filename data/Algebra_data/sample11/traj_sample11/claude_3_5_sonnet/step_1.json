Express 8 as a power of 2:\n   - Recall that $8 = 2^3$\n\n4. Rewrite the equation using the result from step 3:\n   - Replace 8 with $2^3$\n\n5. Apply the laws of exponents:\n   - Use the rule $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$\n\n6. Simplify the left side of the new equation\n\n7. Compare the exponents on both sides:\n   - The exponents should be equal\n\n8. Solve for x:\n   - The equation should now be in the form $2^y = 2^x$, where y is a number\n\n9. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if $2^x$ equals the original left side $(8^3)$\n\n10. Present the final answer for x\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated 8^3 = 512, we can move forward with our solution strategy. The next crucial step is to express 8 as a power of 2. We know that 8 = 2^3.\n\nWith this information, we can rewrite our original equation:\n\n(8^3) = 2^x\n(2^3)^3 = 2^x\n\nNow we need to apply the laws of exponents, specifically the rule (a^b)^c = a^(bc). This will allow us to simplify the left side of the equation further.\n\nAfter applying this rule, we'll have:\n\n2^(3*3) = 2^x\n2^9 = 2^x\n\nAt this point, we've successfully expressed both sides of the equation as powers of 2. The next logical step would be to compare the exponents on both sides.\n\nThe reasoning suggests that our next operation should be to recognize that since the bases (2) are the same on both sides, the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true. This means we can conclude that:\n\n9 = x\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to state that we have found the solution: x = 9.\n",
