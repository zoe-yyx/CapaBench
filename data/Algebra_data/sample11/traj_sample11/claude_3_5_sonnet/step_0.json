    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the given equation:\n   $(8^3) = 2^x$\n\n2. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   - Calculate $8^3$ using a calculator\n\n3. Express 8 as a power of 2:\n   - Recall that $8 = 2^3$\n\n4. Rewrite the equation using the result from step 3:\n   - Replace 8 with $2^3$\n\n5. Apply the laws of exponents:\n   - Use the rule $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$\n\n6. Simplify the left side of the new equation\n\n7. Compare the exponents on both sides:\n   - The exponents should be equal\n\n8. Solve for x:\n   - The equation should now be in the form $2^y = 2^x$, where y is a number\n\n9. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if $2^x$ equals the original left side $(8^3)$\n\n10. Present the final answer for x\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on the left side of the equation: $(8^3) = 2^x$\n\nThe first step is to simplify $8^3$. This will give us a concrete number to work with on the left side of the equation. We should use a calculator to perform this calculation accurately.\n\nAfter that, we'll need to express 8 as a power of 2. This is a crucial step because it will allow us to rewrite the entire left side of the equation in terms of 2, which will make it easier to compare with the right side.\n\nSo, the next operations should be:\n\n1. Calculate $8^3$ using a calculator.\n2. Recall or determine that $8 = 2^3$.\n\nThese steps will set us up to rewrite the equation in a form where we can more easily solve for x.\n",
