Break down the nested function:\n   f(g(f(g(2))))\n   This means we need to evaluate from the innermost function outward.\n\n3. Evaluate g(2):\n   - Apply g(x) to 2\n   - Calculate the result\n\n4. Evaluate f(result from step 3):\n   - Apply f(x) to the result from step 3\n   - Calculate the result\n\n5. Evaluate g(result from step 4):\n   - Apply g(x) to the result from step 4\n   - Calculate the result\n\n6. Final evaluation:\n   - Apply f(x) to the result from step 5\n   - Calculate the final result\n\n7. Double-check the calculations and ensure all steps are correctly followed.\n\n8. Present the final answer.\n\nNote: Each calculation step can be performed using a calculator for accuracy.\n",

We've done this calculation before, but it's good practice to do it again to ensure accuracy and avoid potential errors.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to calculate f(2):\n\nf(x) = 3x - 4\nf(2) = 3(2) - 4\n\nThis calculation will give us our final result. We should instruct the acting agent to use a calculator to perform this operation accurately.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have completed all steps of our plan and arrived at the final answer for f(g(f(g(2)))).\n",
