Evaluate f(result from step 3):\n   - Apply f(x) to the result from step 3\n   - Calculate the result\n\n5.

    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The reasoning process was correct, but the final calculation step was overlooked, leading to an incorrect final answer.\n\nImprovement: After confirming all intermediate steps, the final step of calculating f(2) should have been explicitly performed and its result (which is 2) should have been substituted back into the original function f(x) = 3x - 4 to get the correct final answer of 2.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that while the step-by-step process was largely correct, the final crucial calculation was missed. The agents correctly evaluated g(2) = 2, then f(2) = 2, then g(2) = 2 again, and finally f(2) = 2. However, they stopped at this point, forgetting that this last result of 2 needed to be input back into the function f(x) one more time.\n\nTo improve in future problems:\n\n1. Always double-check that the final step in a multi-step problem has been completed.\n2. When dealing with nested functions, ensure that the outermost function is applied to the final intermediate result.\n3. Clearly distinguish between intermediate results and the final answer.\n4. Implement a final verification step where the obtained answer is plugged back into the original problem to check its validity.\n\nBy following these improvements, the agents should be able to avoid similar oversights in future problem-solving tasks.",
