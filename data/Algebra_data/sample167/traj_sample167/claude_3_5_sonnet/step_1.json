Break down the nested function:\n   f(g(f(g(2))))\n   This means we need to evaluate from the innermost function outward.\n\n3. Evaluate g(2):\n   - Apply g(x) to 2\n   - Calculate the result\n\n4. Evaluate f(result from step 3):\n   - Apply f(x) to the result from step 3\n   - Calculate the result\n\n5. Evaluate g(result from step 4):\n   - Apply g(x) to the result from step 4\n   - Calculate the result\n\n6. Final evaluation:\n   - Apply f(x) to the result from step 5\n   - Calculate the final result\n\n7. Double-check the calculations and ensure all steps are correctly followed.\n\n8.
