Break down the nested function:\n   f(g(f(g(2))))\n   This means we need to evaluate from the innermost function outward.\n\n3. Evaluate g(2):\n   - Apply g(x) to 2\n   - Calculate the result\n\n4. Evaluate f(result from step 3):\n   - Apply f(x) to the result from step 3\n   - Calculate the result\n\n5. Evaluate g(result from step 4):\n   - Apply g(x) to the result from step 4\n   - Calculate the result\n\n6. Final evaluation:\n   - Apply f(x) to the result from step 5\n   - Calculate the final result\n\n7. Double-check the calculations and ensure all steps are correctly followed.\n\n8.

Let's reason through the final step:\n\n1. We need to evaluate f(2) one last time.\n2. Recall that f(x) = 3x - 4\n3. So, we need to calculate f(2) = 3(2) - 4\n\nThis final calculation will give us the correct answer to f(g(f(g(2)))).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we should guide the acting agent to use a calculator for this final computation. After this calculation, we'll have our final, correct answer.\n\nOnce we have this result, we should:\n1. Clearly state the final answer.\n2. Verify that we've completed all steps in our original plan.\n3. Double-check our work by plugging the final answer back into the original nested function to ensure it's correct.\n\nThis process will help us avoid similar oversights in the future and provide a more robust problem-solving approach.\n",
