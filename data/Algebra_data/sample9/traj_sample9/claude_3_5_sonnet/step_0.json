    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - Bob starts at point (5, 0) on the x-axis\n   - He sprints at a speed of 8 m/s\n   - He sprints for 10 seconds\n\n2. Identify the key concept:\n   - This is a one-dimensional motion problem along the x-axis\n   - We need to find the displacement in the x-direction\n\n3. Outline the solution steps:\n   a) Calculate the distance Bob travels:\n      - Use the formula: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   b) Add the traveled distance to Bob's initial x-coordinate:\n      - Final x-coordinate = Initial x-coordinate + Distance traveled\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Use a calculator to multiply speed by time\n   - Add the result to the initial x-coordinate\n\n5. Present the final answer:\n   - State Bob's x-coordinate when he stops\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the units are correct (should be in meters)\n   - Ensure the calculation makes sense given the initial position and direction of motion\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the outlined steps in the planning strategy. Let's start with calculating the distance Bob travels during his sprint.\n\nWe know that:\n- Bob's speed is 8 m/s\n- He sprints for 10 seconds\n\nUsing the formula Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time, we can calculate the distance Bob travels. This will be our first calculation.\n\nAfter we determine the distance, we'll need to add it to Bob's initial x-coordinate (5) to find his final position.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use a calculator to multiply 8 m/s by 10 seconds to find the distance Bob travels. This calculation will give us the displacement along the x-axis, which we'll then use to determine Bob's final x-coordinate.\n",
