    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To find Bob's final position, use the formula $x = v \\cdot t$, where $v$ is the speed and $t$ is the time. Given that $v = 8\\ \\text{m/s}$ and $t = 10\\ \\text{s}$, the distance he covered is $x = 8 \\cdot 10 = 80\\ \\text{m}$. Starting from $(5, 0)$ on the x-axis, his final x-coordinate is $5 + 80 = \\boxed{85}$.",
