    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equations:\n   - Equation 1: xy = 10\n   - Equation 2: x + y = 9\n\n2. Recognize that we need to find |x-y|, which is the absolute difference between x and y.\n\n3. Approach:\n   a) Use the given equations to solve for x and y.\n   b) Once we have x and y, calculate x-y and take its absolute value.\n\n4. Steps to solve:\n   a) Square both sides of Equation 2: (x+y)^2 = 9^2\n   b) Expand: x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 81\n   c) Substitute xy = 10 from Equation 1: x^2 + 20 + y^2 = 81\n   d) Simplify: x^2 + y^2 = 61\n   e) Use the difference of squares formula: (x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy\n   f) Substitute known values to solve for (x-y)^2\n   g) Take the square root to find |x-y|\n\n5. Calculations needed:\n   - Square 9\n   - Subtract 20 from 81\n   - Use the difference of squares formula\n   - Calculate square root\n\n6. Expected outcome:\n   After following these steps, we should be able to determine the exact value of |x-y|.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the reflection on the previous error, let's refocus our reasoning to provide a more mathematically precise answer:\n\n1. We correctly derived that (x-y)^2 = 41 from our previous steps.\n\n2. To find |x-y|, we need to take the square root of both sides of this equation.\n\n3. The square root of 41 is not a perfect square, so it cannot be simplified further.\n\n4. Therefore, the exact value of |x-y| is \u221a41.\n\n5. We should maintain this answer in its exact form rather than approximating it with a decimal.\n\n6. This expression, \u221a41, is the most precise way to represent the absolute difference between x and y given the information in the problem.\n\nOur reasoning leads us to conclude that the correct answer should be stated as |x-y| = \u221a41. This maintains the mathematical precision of the solution without introducing any rounding errors or approximations.\n\nWe should guide the acting agent to confirm this exact form as the final answer, rather than calculating a decimal approximation.\n",
