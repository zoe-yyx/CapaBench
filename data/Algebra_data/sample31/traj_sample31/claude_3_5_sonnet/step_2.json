    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equations:\n   - Equation 1: xy = 10\n   - Equation 2: x + y = 9\n\n2. Recognize that we need to find |x-y|, which is the absolute difference between x and y.\n\n3. Approach:\n   a) Use the given equations to solve for x and y.\n   b) Once we have x and y, calculate x-y and take its absolute value.\n\n4. Steps to solve:\n   a) Square both sides of Equation 2: (x+y)^2 = 9^2\n   b) Expand: x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 81\n   c) Substitute xy = 10 from Equation 1: x^2 + 20 + y^2 = 81\n   d) Simplify: x^2 + y^2 = 61\n   e) Use the difference of squares formula: (x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy\n   f) Substitute known values to solve for (x-y)^2\n   g) Take the square root to find |x-y|\n\n5. Calculations needed:\n   - Square 9\n   - Subtract 20 from 81\n   - Use the difference of squares formula\n   - Calculate square root\n\n6. Expected outcome:\n   After following these steps, we should be able to determine the exact value of |x-y|.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress so far, we have successfully calculated that x^2 + y^2 = 61. This is a crucial step in our solution process. Now, we need to use this information along with the difference of squares formula to find |x-y|.\n\nLet's recall the difference of squares formula:\n(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy\n\nWe know that:\n- (x+y)^2 = 81 (from our first calculation)\n- xy = 10 (given in the original problem)\n- x^2 + y^2 = 61 (from our last calculation)\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the difference of squares formula:\n\n81 - (x-y)^2 = 4(10)\n81 - (x-y)^2 = 40\n\nTo isolate (x-y)^2, we need to subtract 40 from both sides:\n\n(x-y)^2 = 81 - 40 = 41\n\nThis gives us (x-y)^2 = 41. To find |x-y|, we need to take the square root of 41.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to calculate the square root of 41. This will give us the final answer to |x-y|.\n",
