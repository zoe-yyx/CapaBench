    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equations:\n   - Equation 1: xy = 10\n   - Equation 2: x + y = 9\n\n2. Recognize that we need to find |x-y|, which is the absolute difference between x and y.\n\n3. Approach:\n   a) Use the given equations to solve for x and y.\n   b) Once we have x and y, calculate x-y and take its absolute value.\n\n4. Steps to solve:\n   a) Square both sides of Equation 2: (x+y)^2 = 9^2\n   b) Expand: x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 81\n   c) Substitute xy = 10 from Equation 1: x^2 + 20 + y^2 = 81\n   d) Simplify: x^2 + y^2 = 61\n   e) Use the difference of squares formula: (x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy\n   f) Substitute known values to solve for (x-y)^2\n   g) Take the square root to find |x-y|\n\n5. Calculations needed:\n   - Square 9\n   - Subtract 20 from 81\n   - Use the difference of squares formula\n   - Calculate square root\n\n6. Expected outcome:\n   After following these steps, we should be able to determine the exact value of |x-y|.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated 9^2 = 81, we can proceed with the next steps in our problem-solving strategy:\n\n1. We know that (x+y)^2 = 81\n2. Expanding this, we get: x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 81\n3. We are given that xy = 10, so we can substitute this:\n   x^2 + 2(10) + y^2 = 81\n   x^2 + 20 + y^2 = 81\n\nOur next step is to isolate x^2 + y^2. To do this, we need to subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 81 - 20\n\nThis subtraction will give us the value for x^2 + y^2, which is a crucial step in our solution process. Once we have this value, we can move on to using the difference of squares formula to find (x-y)^2.\n\nTherefore, our next calculation should be to subtract 20 from 81.\n",
