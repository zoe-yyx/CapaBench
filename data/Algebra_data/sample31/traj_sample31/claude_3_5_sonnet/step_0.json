    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given equations:\n   - Equation 1: xy = 10\n   - Equation 2: x + y = 9\n\n2. Recognize that we need to find |x-y|, which is the absolute difference between x and y.\n\n3. Approach:\n   a) Use the given equations to solve for x and y.\n   b) Once we have x and y, calculate x-y and take its absolute value.\n\n4. Steps to solve:\n   a) Square both sides of Equation 2: (x+y)^2 = 9^2\n   b) Expand: x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 81\n   c) Substitute xy = 10 from Equation 1: x^2 + 20 + y^2 = 81\n   d) Simplify: x^2 + y^2 = 61\n   e) Use the difference of squares formula: (x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = 4xy\n   f) Substitute known values to solve for (x-y)^2\n   g) Take the square root to find |x-y|\n\n5. Calculations needed:\n   - Square 9\n   - Subtract 20 from 81\n   - Use the difference of squares formula\n   - Calculate square root\n\n6. Expected outcome:\n   After following these steps, we should be able to determine the exact value of |x-y|.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the planning strategy. Let's start with squaring both sides of the equation x + y = 9.\n\n1. We need to calculate 9^2, which will give us the right side of the equation (x + y)^2 = 9^2.\n\n2. After that, we'll expand (x + y)^2 and substitute xy = 10 into the expanded form.\n\n3. These steps will allow us to set up the equation x^2 + y^2 = 61, which is crucial for using the difference of squares formula later.\n\nTherefore, the first calculation we need to perform is 9^2. This will set the foundation for the subsequent steps in our problem-solving process.\n",
