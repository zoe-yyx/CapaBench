Substitute y in Equation 1:\n   3x^2 + 4(2x - 3) = 16\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   3x^2 + 8x - 12 = 16\n   3x^2 + 8x - 28 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 3, b = 8, and c = -28\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the original problem, we need to adjust our approach to solve this problem more accurately. Let's revise our reasoning:\n\n1. We correctly derived the quadratic equation: 3x^2 + 8x - 28 = 0\n\n2. Instead of using decimal approximations, we should solve this equation exactly:\n   Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   Where a = 3, b = 8, and c = -28\n\n   x = [-8 \u00b1 \u221a(64 + 336)] / 6\n   x = [-8 \u00b1 \u221a400] / 6\n   x = [-8 \u00b1 20] / 6\n\n3. This gives us two exact solutions:\n   x\u2081 = (-8 + 20) / 6 = 12 / 6 = 2\n   x\u2082 = (-8 - 20) / 6 = -28 / 6 = -14/3\n\n4. For each x, we can calculate y using y = 2x - 3:\n   For x\u2081 = 2: y\u2081 = 2(2) - 3 = 1\n   For x\u2082 = -14/3: y\u2082 = 2(-14/3) - 3 = -28/3 - 3 = -37/3\n\n5. Now, we need to calculate 4x + 3y for each pair:\n   For (x\u2081, y\u2081): 4(2) + 3(1) = 8 + 3 = 11\n   For (x\u2082, y\u2082): 4(-14/3) + 3(-37/3) = -56/3 - 37 = -167/3\n\n6. The final step is to sum these exact values:\n   11 + (-167/3) = 33/3 - 167/3 = -134/3\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to perform these calculations using exact values, and present the final answer as the fraction -134/3, without any decimal approximation.\n",
