Substitute y in Equation 1:\n   3x^2 + 4(2x - 3) = 16\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   3x^2 + 8x - 12 = 16\n   3x^2 + 8x - 28 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 3, b = 8, and c = -28\n\n6. Calculate the values of x:\n   - There should be two solutions for x\n\n7. For each value of x:\n   - Calculate the corresponding y using Equation 2: y = 2x - 3\n\n8. For each pair of (x, y):\n   - Calculate 4x + 3y\n\n9. Sum up the results of 4x + 3y for all solutions\n\n10.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions, we've made significant progress. We've simplified the system of equations to a quadratic equation and solved for one of the x values using the quadratic formula. Let's continue our reasoning:\n\n1. We've found one value of x: x = 2\n\n2. We need to find the other value of x using the negative part of the quadratic formula:\n   x = (-8 - \u221a(8^2 - 4*3*(-28))) / (2*3)\n\n3. Once we have both x values, we need to calculate the corresponding y values using y = 2x - 3\n\n4. For each (x, y) pair, we need to calculate 4x + 3y\n\n5. Finally, we'll sum the results of 4x + 3y for both pairs\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate the second x value and then proceed with finding the y values and computing 4x + 3y for both solutions.\n\nI suggest the acting agent use a calculator to:\n1. Calculate the second x value using (-8 - \u221a(8^2 - 4*3*(-28))) / (2*3)\n2. For both x values (2 and the newly calculated one), compute y using y = 2x - 3\n3.
