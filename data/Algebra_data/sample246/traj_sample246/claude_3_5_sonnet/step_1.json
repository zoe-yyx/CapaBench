Substitute y in Equation 1:\n   3x^2 + 4(2x - 3) = 16\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   3x^2 + 8x - 12 = 16\n   3x^2 + 8x - 28 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 3, b = 8, and c = -28\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical action, we've successfully simplified our system of equations into a single quadratic equation: 3x^2 + 8x - 28 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation to find the possible values of x.
