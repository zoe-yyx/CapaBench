    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the given system of equations:\n   - Equation 1: 3x^2 + 4y = 16\n   - Equation 2: 2x - y = 3\n\n2. Isolate y in Equation 2:\n   y = 2x - 3\n\n3. Substitute y in Equation 1:\n   3x^2 + 4(2x - 3) = 16\n\n4. Simplify the resulting equation:\n   3x^2 + 8x - 12 = 16\n   3x^2 + 8x - 28 = 0\n\n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 3, b = 8, and c = -28\n\n6. Calculate the values of x:\n   - There should be two solutions for x\n\n7. For each value of x:\n   - Calculate the corresponding y using Equation 2: y = 2x - 3\n\n8. For each pair of (x, y):\n   - Calculate 4x + 3y\n\n9. Sum up the results of 4x + 3y for all solutions\n\n10. Present the final sum as the answer\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for complex calculations, especially when solving the quadratic equation and calculating the final sum.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by focusing on steps 2 and 3 to simplify our system of equations. \n\nLet's begin by isolating y in the second equation: 2x - y = 3\nRearranging this, we get: y = 2x - 3\n\nNow, we need to substitute this expression for y into the first equation: 3x^2 + 4y = 16\n\nBy substituting y = 2x - 3 into this equation, we'll get:\n3x^2 + 4(2x - 3) = 16\n\nThis substitution will allow us to create a single equation in terms of x, which is a crucial step in solving this system of equations. \n\nThe next logical step would be to expand and simplify this equation, which will lead us to a quadratic equation in x. Solving this quadratic equation will give us the possible values of x, from which we can then determine the corresponding y values and ultimately calculate 4x + 3y for each solution pair.\n\nI suggest the acting agent use a calculator to expand the equation 3x^2 + 4(2x - 3) = 16 and simplify it to standard quadratic form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. This will prepare us for solving the quadratic equation in the subsequent steps.\n",
