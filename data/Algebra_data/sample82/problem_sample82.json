    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, simplify the equation to $x^2 - 8x + 16 = 36$, which further simplifies to $x^2 - 8x - 20 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x - 10)(x + 2) = 0$. The solutions are $x = 10$ and $x = -2$. The product of the solutions is $10 \\times (-2) = \\boxed{-20}$.",
