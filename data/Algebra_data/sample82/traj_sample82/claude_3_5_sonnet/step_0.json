    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the original problem, we should start by solving the equation $(x-4)^2 = 36$. Let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. The equation is in the form $(x-a)^2 = b$, where $a = 4$ and $b = 36$.\n\n2. To solve this, we need to take the square root of both sides. Remember, when we take the square root, we need to consider both the positive and negative roots.\n\n3. This gives us:\n   $x - 4 = \\pm \\sqrt{36}$\n\n4. We know that $\\sqrt{36} = 6$, so our equation becomes:\n   $x - 4 = \\pm 6$\n\n5. Now we can solve for x:\n   $x = 4 \\pm 6$\n\n6. This means we have two solutions:\n   $x = 4 + 6 = 10$ or $x = 4 - 6 = -2$\n\n7. To find the product of all solutions, we need to multiply these two values.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to calculate the product of 10 and -2. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this multiplication.\n",
