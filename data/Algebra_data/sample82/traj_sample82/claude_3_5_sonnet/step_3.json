Simplify the equation:\n   - The equation is already in its simplest form\n\n3. Solve for x:\n   - Take the square root of both sides\n   - Remember to consider both positive and negative roots\n\n4. Calculate the solutions:\n   - Use the calculator to perform any necessary arithmetic\n\n5. Find the product of solutions:\n   - Multiply the two solutions obtained in step 4\n\n6. Verify the answer:\n   - Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to check\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - Clearly state the product of all solutions\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, as it involves straightforward algebraic steps and simple calculations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, we have successfully completed all the necessary steps to solve the problem. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We solved the equation $(x-4)^2 = 36$ and found two solutions: x = 10 and x = -2.\n\n2. We calculated the product of these solutions: 10 * (-2) = -20.\n\n3. We verified both solutions:\n   - For x = 10: (10-4)^2 - 36 = 0, which confirms it's correct.\n   - For x = -2: (-2-4)^2 - 36 = 0, which also confirms it's correct.\n\n4. Both solutions satisfy the original equation, validating our work.\n\n5. We have completed all steps in the planning strategy, including solving, calculating the product, and verifying the solutions.\n\nGiven that we have finished all necessary calculations and verifications, our next step should be to present the final answer. The acting agent should formulate a clear and concise statement that summarizes our findings, specifically stating that the product of all solutions to the equation $(x-4)^2 = 36$ is -20.\n",
