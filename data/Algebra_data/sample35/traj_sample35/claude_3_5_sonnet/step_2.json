    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - This is a difference of squares problem: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = 700 and b = 300\n\n2. Recall the algebraic formula:\n   - For difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute a = 700 and b = 300 into (a+b)(a-b)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate (700 + 300) and (700 - 300)\n   - Multiply the results\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to compute 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and subtract\n   - Compare this result with the one obtained from the formula method\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the progress so far, we have successfully calculated both parts of the difference of squares formula: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n1. We have (a+b) = 700 + 300 = 1000\n2. We now have (a-b) = 700 - 300 = 400\n\nThe next logical step in our problem-solving process is to multiply these two results together. This multiplication will give us the final answer to our original problem: 700\u00b2 - 300\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to use the calculator to multiply 1000 by 400. This operation will complete our calculation using the difference of squares formula and provide us with the final result.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have our answer, and we can optionally verify it by calculating 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and then subtracting, as mentioned in step 5 of our original plan.\n",
