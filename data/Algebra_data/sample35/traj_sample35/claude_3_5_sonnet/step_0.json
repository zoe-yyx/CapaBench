    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - This is a difference of squares problem: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = 700 and b = 300\n\n2. Recall the algebraic formula:\n   - For difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute a = 700 and b = 300 into (a+b)(a-b)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate (700 + 300) and (700 - 300)\n   - Multiply the results\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to compute 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and subtract\n   - Compare this result with the one obtained from the formula method\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the nature of the problem, we should guide the acting agent to apply the difference of squares formula. This approach will simplify the calculation and make it more manageable. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. We have identified that this problem fits the difference of squares formula: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n2. In this case, a = 700 and b = 300\n\n3. The next logical step is to calculate (a+b) and (a-b) separately:\n   - (a+b) = (700 + 300)\n   - (a-b) = (700 - 300)\n\n4. Once these calculations are done, we'll need to multiply the results\n\nTherefore, we should instruct the acting agent to perform these calculations using a calculator:\n\nStep 1: Calculate (700 + 300)\nStep 2: Calculate (700 - 300)\nStep 3: Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2\n\nThis approach will give us the final answer efficiently and accurately.\n",
