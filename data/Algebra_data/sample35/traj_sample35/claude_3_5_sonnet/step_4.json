    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - This is a difference of squares problem: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = 700 and b = 300\n\n2. Recall the algebraic formula:\n   - For difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute a = 700 and b = 300 into (a+b)(a-b)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate (700 + 300) and (700 - 300)\n   - Multiply the results\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to compute 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and subtract\n   - Compare this result with the one obtained from the formula method\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the planning strategy, we have successfully calculated 700\u00b2 as part of our verification process. The result is 490,000. To complete the verification, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate 300\u00b2\n2. Subtract 300\u00b2 from 700\u00b2\n3. Compare this result with our previous answer of 400,000\n\nThis verification will ensure the accuracy of our initial calculation using the difference of squares formula and provide a cross-check for our solution.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to calculate 300\u00b2. Once we have this result, we can perform the subtraction and compare it with our original answer.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to use the calculator to compute 300\u00b2.\n",
