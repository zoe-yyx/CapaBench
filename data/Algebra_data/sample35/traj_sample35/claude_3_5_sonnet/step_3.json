    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - This is a difference of squares problem: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = 700 and b = 300\n\n2. Recall the algebraic formula:\n   - For difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute a = 700 and b = 300 into (a+b)(a-b)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate (700 + 300) and (700 - 300)\n   - Multiply the results\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to compute 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and subtract\n   - Compare this result with the one obtained from the formula method\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, historical actions, and the current progress, we have successfully applied the difference of squares formula: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b). Let's review our steps and determine the next action:\n\n1. We calculated (a+b) = 700 + 300 = 1000\n2. We calculated (a-b) = 700 - 300 = 400\n3. We multiplied these results: 1000 * 400 = 400,000\n\nAt this point, we have arrived at our final answer: 700\u00b2 - 300\u00b2 = 400,000.\n\nHowever, to ensure the accuracy of our result and to complete step 5 of our original plan, we should verify this answer using a different method. We can do this by:\n\n1. Calculating 700\u00b2 directly\n2. Calculating 300\u00b2 directly\n3. Subtracting the results\n\nThis verification step will provide additional confidence in our answer and demonstrate the equivalence of the two methods.\n\nTherefore, our next action should be to use the calculator to compute 700\u00b2.\n",
