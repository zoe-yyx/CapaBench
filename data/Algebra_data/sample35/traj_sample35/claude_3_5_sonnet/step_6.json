    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - This is a difference of squares problem: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = 700 and b = 300\n\n2. Recall the algebraic formula:\n   - For difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute a = 700 and b = 300 into (a+b)(a-b)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate (700 + 300) and (700 - 300)\n   - Multiply the results\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to compute 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and subtract\n   - Compare this result with the one obtained from the formula method\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our comprehensive problem-solving process and verification steps, we have successfully solved the problem and confirmed our answer. Let's summarize our findings:\n\n1. Using the difference of squares formula (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)):\n   We calculated 700\u00b2 - 300\u00b2 = (700 + 300)(700 - 300) = 1000 * 400 = 400,000\n\n2. Using direct calculation for verification:\n   700\u00b2 = 490,000\n   300\u00b2 = 90,000\n   490,000 - 90,000 = 400,000\n\nBoth methods have yielded the same result of 400,000, which confirms the accuracy of our solution. We have completed all steps in our planning strategy, including the verification process.\n\nAt this point, we have definitively solved the problem. The value of 700\u00b2 - 300\u00b2 is 400,000.\n\nThe next logical step would be to present this final answer and explain the methods used to arrive at it. We can highlight how the difference of squares formula provides an efficient way to solve such problems and how direct calculation can be used for verification.\n\nNo further calculations are needed. The acting agent should now focus on presenting the final answer and the problem-solving process used.\n",
