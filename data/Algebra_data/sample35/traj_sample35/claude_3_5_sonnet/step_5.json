    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - This is a difference of squares problem: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = 700 and b = 300\n\n2. Recall the algebraic formula:\n   - For difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute a = 700 and b = 300 into (a+b)(a-b)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate (700 + 300) and (700 - 300)\n   - Multiply the results\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to compute 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and subtract\n   - Compare this result with the one obtained from the formula method\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our progress and the verification process we've initiated, we now have the following information:\n\n1. Using the difference of squares formula: 700\u00b2 - 300\u00b2 = 400,000\n2. Direct calculation of 700\u00b2 = 490,000\n3. Direct calculation of 300\u00b2 = 90,000\n\nTo complete our verification, we need to subtract 300\u00b2 from 700\u00b2. This will allow us to confirm that our original answer using the difference of squares formula is correct.\n\nThe next logical step is to perform this subtraction: 490,000 - 90,000\n\nThis calculation will give us the final result of our direct method, which we can then compare to our initial answer of 400,000.\n\nTherefore, we should guide the acting agent to use the calculator to subtract 90,000 from 490,000. This will complete our verification process and allow us to confirm the accuracy of our solution using both methods.\n",
