    "planning_context": "\n1. Recognize the problem structure:\n   - This is a difference of squares problem: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 where a = 700 and b = 300\n\n2. Recall the algebraic formula:\n   - For difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b)\n\n3. Apply the formula:\n   - Substitute a = 700 and b = 300 into (a+b)(a-b)\n\n4. Perform calculations:\n   - Calculate (700 + 300) and (700 - 300)\n   - Multiply the results\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Optionally, use a calculator to compute 700\u00b2 and 300\u00b2 separately and subtract\n   - Compare this result with the one obtained from the formula method\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the progress so far, we have successfully completed the first step of our calculation using the difference of squares formula: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a+b)(a-b).\n\nWe've calculated (a+b), which is (700 + 300) = 1000.\n\nNow, we need to continue with the next steps of our plan:\n\n1. Calculate (a-b), which is (700 - 300)\n2. Multiply the result of (a+b) and (a-b)\n\nTherefore, our next logical step is to calculate (700 - 300). This will give us the second factor in our difference of squares formula.\n\nOnce we have this result, we'll be able to multiply it with the previously calculated sum (1000) to get our final answer.\n\nSo, we should guide the acting agent to use the calculator to perform the subtraction 700 - 300.\n",
