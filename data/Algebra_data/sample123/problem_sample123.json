    "problem": "If $C = -\\frac{1}{3}$ and $D = \\frac{2}{3}$, what is the absolute value of the sum of $24C$ and $24D$? ",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are looking for $|24C + 24D|$, which simplifies to $|24(C + D)| = 24|C + D|$. Since $C + D = -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$, we find $24|C + D| = 24\\cdot\\frac{1}{3} = 8$. Thus, the absolute value is $\\boxed{8}$.",
