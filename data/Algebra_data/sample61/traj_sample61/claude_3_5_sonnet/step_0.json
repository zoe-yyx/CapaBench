    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the components of the expression:\n   - Main operation: Division\n   - Left side: (3^4 \u00b7 3^-1)\n   - Right side: 3^2\n\n2. Simplify the left side of the division:\n   - Apply the rule of exponents for multiplication: a^m \u00b7 a^n = a^(m+n)\n   - Combine the exponents: 3^4 \u00b7 3^-1 = 3^(4-1) = 3^3\n\n3. Set up the simplified division:\n   3^3 \u00f7 3^2\n\n4. Apply the rule of exponents for division:\n   - Use the formula: a^m \u00f7 a^n = a^(m-n)\n\n5. Perform the final simplification:\n   - Subtract the exponents: 3^(3-2) = 3^1\n\n6. Express the result in terms of 3^x:\n   - Identify that the final result is already in the form 3^x, where x = 1\n\n7. State the final answer:\n   - The simplified expression is 3^1\n   - The value of x is 1\n\n8. Double-check the solution:\n   - Verify that all steps are correct and the final answer matches the original expression\n\nNote: This problem can be solved without using a calculator or search engine, as it primarily involves applying rules of exponents and basic arithmetic.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the expression $(3^4 \\cdot 3^{-1}) \\div 3^2$, we should focus on simplifying it step by step using the laws of exponents. \n\n1. Let's start by simplifying the left side of the division: $(3^4 \\cdot 3^{-1})$\n   - We can use the rule for multiplying powers with the same base: $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$\n   - So, $3^4 \\cdot 3^{-1} = 3^{4+(-1)} = 3^3$\n\n2. Now our expression looks like: $3^3 \\div 3^2$\n\n3. For the division, we can use the rule for dividing powers with the same base: $a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n}$\n   - So, $3^3 \\div 3^2 = 3^{3-2} = 3^1$\n\n4. We've now simplified the expression to $3^1$, which is already in the form $3^x$\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that $x = 1$\n\nThe acting agent should verify these steps and confirm the final result.
