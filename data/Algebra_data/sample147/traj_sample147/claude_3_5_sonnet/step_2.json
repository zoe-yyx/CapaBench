    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Painter Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 4 painters can paint 4 walls in 4 hours\n   - We need to find the time for 6 painters to paint 6 walls\n   - All painters work at the same rate\n\n2. Determine the key relationship:\n   - Identify the relationship between number of painters, walls, and time\n\n3. Calculate the rate of work:\n   - Find how many walls one painter can paint in one hour\n\n4. Apply the rate to the new scenario:\n   - Use the calculated rate to determine the time for 6 painters and 6 walls\n\n5. Formulate the equation:\n   - Set up an equation to solve for the unknown time\n\n6. Solve the equation:\n   - Perform the necessary calculations to find the final answer\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes logical sense given the original information\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the time it would take 6 painters to paint 6 walls\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations we've performed, we now have all the necessary information to conclude our problem-solving process. Let's summarize our findings and reasoning:\n\n1. We calculated that one painter can paint 0.25 walls per hour.\n2. With 6 painters, the combined rate is 1.5 walls per hour (6 * 0.25 = 1.5).\n3. We set up the equation: Time * 1.5 = 6\n4. Solving this equation, we found that Time = 6 / 1.5 = 4 hours\n\nThis result makes logical sense because:\n- In the original scenario, 4 painters painted 4 walls in 4 hours.\n- In our new scenario, we increased both the number of painters and walls by 1.5 times (from 4 to 6).\n- The time remained the same (4 hours) because the increase in painters compensated for the increase in walls.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that it would take 6 painters 4 hours to paint 6 walls, working at the same rate as in the original problem.\n\nThe next step for the acting agent should be to formulate and present this final answer clearly.\n",
