    "observation": "If four painters can paint four walls in four hours, how long would it take six painters to paint six walls, assuming all painters work at the same rate?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Painter Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 4 painters can paint 4 walls in 4 hours\n   - We need to find the time for 6 painters to paint 6 walls\n   - All painters work at the same rate\n\n2. Determine the key relationship:\n   - Identify the relationship between number of painters, walls, and time\n\n3. Calculate the rate of work:\n   - Find how many walls one painter can paint in one hour\n\n4. Apply the rate to the new scenario:\n   - Use the calculated rate to determine the time for 6 painters and 6 walls\n\n5. Formulate the equation:\n   - Set up an equation to solve for the unknown time\n\n6. Solve the equation:\n   - Perform the necessary calculations to find the final answer\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes logical sense given the original information\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the time it would take 6 painters to paint 6 walls\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to first understand the rate at which the painters work. Let's focus on determining how many walls one painter can paint in one hour.\n\nFrom the given information:\n4 painters can paint 4 walls in 4 hours\n\nTo find the rate, we need to calculate:\n(Number of walls) / (Number of painters * Number of hours)\n\nThis will give us the number of walls one painter can paint in one hour.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this calculation:\n4 / (4 * 4) = 0.25 walls per painter per hour\n\nThis rate will be crucial for solving the rest of the problem, as it remains constant regardless of the number of painters or walls.\n",
