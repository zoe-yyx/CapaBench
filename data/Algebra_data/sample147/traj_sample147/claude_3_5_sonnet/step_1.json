    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Painter Problem:\n\n1. Analyze the given information:\n   - 4 painters can paint 4 walls in 4 hours\n   - We need to find the time for 6 painters to paint 6 walls\n   - All painters work at the same rate\n\n2. Determine the key relationship:\n   - Identify the relationship between number of painters, walls, and time\n\n3. Calculate the rate of work:\n   - Find how many walls one painter can paint in one hour\n\n4. Apply the rate to the new scenario:\n   - Use the calculated rate to determine the time for 6 painters and 6 walls\n\n5. Formulate the equation:\n   - Set up an equation to solve for the unknown time\n\n6. Solve the equation:\n   - Perform the necessary calculations to find the final answer\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the answer makes logical sense given the original information\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State the time it would take 6 painters to paint 6 walls\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing basic arithmetic operations that can be performed using a calculator if needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have calculated the rate at which one painter can paint walls (0.25 walls per hour), we can use this information to solve for the time it would take 6 painters to paint 6 walls.\n\nLet's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that one painter can paint 0.25 walls per hour.\n2. With 6 painters, the combined rate would be 6 * 0.25 = 1.5 walls per hour.\n3. We need to find out how long it would take to paint 6 walls at this rate.\n\nTo do this, we can set up a simple equation:\nTime * Rate = Number of walls\n\nIn this case:\nTime * 1.5 = 6\n\nTo solve for Time, we need to divide both sides by 1.5:\nTime = 6 / 1.5\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this final calculation to get our answer.\n",
