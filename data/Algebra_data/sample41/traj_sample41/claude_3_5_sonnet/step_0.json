    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Geometric Sequence Problem:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - The first term (a\u2081) is 625\n   - The third term (a\u2083) is 25\n   - We need to find the fifth term (a\u2085)\n\n2. Determine the common ratio (r):\n   - Use the formula: a\u2083 = a\u2081 * r\u00b2\n   - Substitute known values and solve for r\n\n3. Calculate the exact value of r:\n   - Use a calculator to find the square root\n\n4. Verify the sequence:\n   - Calculate a\u2082 using a\u2081 and r\n   - Confirm that a\u2083 is indeed 25\n\n5. Find the fifth term (a\u2085):\n   - Use the formula: a\u2085 = a\u2081 * r\u2074\n   - Substitute known values of a\u2081 and r\n\n6.

Divide both sides by 625\n2. Take the square root of the result\n\nThis will give us the value of r, which is crucial for finding the fifth term.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these operations:\n1.
