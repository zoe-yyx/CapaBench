    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The distances covered in each hour form an arithmetic series. The first hour, 2 miles are covered. The second hour, $2 + 0.5 = 2.5$ miles are covered, the third hour $2.5 + 0.5 = 3$ miles, and the fourth hour $3 + 0.5 = 3.5$ miles. The total distance is the sum of these, $2 + 2.5 + 3 + 3.5 = \\boxed{11}$ miles.",
