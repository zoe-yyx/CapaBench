    "planning_context": "\n1. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   - Calculate the square root of 225 using a calculator\n\n2. Isolate the square root term on one side:\n   - Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation\n\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n   - This will isolate x on one side\n\n4. Solve the resulting equation for x:\n   - Perform any necessary arithmetic operations\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Plug the found value of x back into the original equation to check\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that satisfies the equation\n\nThis plan should allow us to solve for x efficiently, using basic algebra and arithmetic operations. The acting agent can use a calculator for any complex calculations if needed.\n",
