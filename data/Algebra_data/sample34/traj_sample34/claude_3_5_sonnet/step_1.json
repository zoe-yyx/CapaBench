    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the action taken, we have successfully completed step 1 by calculating \u221a225 = 15. Now we can proceed with the next steps in our plan.\n\nReasoning for the next operation:\n\n1. We now have the simplified equation: 15 = 5 + \u221ax\n\n2. Following our plan, the next step is to isolate the square root term on one side of the equation.\n\n3. To do this, we need to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will isolate \u221ax on one side.\n\n4. This operation is a simple arithmetic calculation that the acting agent can perform without a calculator.\n\n5. Subtracting 5 from both sides will give us: 10 = \u221ax\n\nTherefore, the next logical operation for the acting agent is to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation 15 = 5 + \u221ax. This will move us to step 2 of our plan and bring us closer to solving for x.\n",
