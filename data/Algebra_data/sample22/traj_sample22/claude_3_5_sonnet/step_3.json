    "planning_context": "\nPlan to solve the equation 3|x - 2| = 15:\n\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - We have an absolute value expression |x - 2|\n   - This expression is multiplied by 3\n   - The result equals 15\n\n2. Isolate the absolute value term:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 3\n   - This will give us |x - 2| = 5\n\n3. Consider the two cases of absolute value:\n   a) x - 2 = 5 (when x - 2 is non-negative)\n   b) -(x - 2) = 5 (when x - 2 is negative)\n\n4. Solve each case:\n   a) For x - 2 = 5:\n      - Add 2 to both sides\n      - Solve for x\n   b) For -(x - 2) = 5:\n      - Multiply both sides by -1\n      - Solve for x\n\n5. Check both solutions:\n   - Verify which solution(s) satisfy the original equation\n\n6. Identify the smaller solution:\n   - Compare the two solutions (if both exist)\n   - Select the smaller value\n\n7. Verify the final answer:\n   - Plug the chosen x value back into the original equation\n   - Confirm that 3|x - 2| indeed equals 15\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct smaller solution for the equation 3|x - 2| = 15 within the 10-round limit.\n",
