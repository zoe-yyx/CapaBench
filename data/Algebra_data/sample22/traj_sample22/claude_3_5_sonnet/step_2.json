    "planning_context": "\nPlan to solve the equation 3|x - 2| = 15:\n\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - We have an absolute value expression |x - 2|\n   - This expression is multiplied by 3\n   - The result equals 15\n\n2. Isolate the absolute value term:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 3\n   - This will give us |x - 2| = 5\n\n3. Consider the two cases of absolute value:\n   a) x - 2 = 5 (when x - 2 is non-negative)\n   b) -(x - 2) = 5 (when x - 2 is negative)\n\n4. Solve each case:\n   a) For x - 2 = 5:\n      - Add 2 to both sides\n      - Solve for x\n   b) For -(x - 2) = 5:\n      - Multiply both sides by -1\n      - Solve for x\n\n5. Check both solutions:\n   - Verify which solution(s) satisfy the original equation\n\n6. Identify the smaller solution:\n   - Compare the two solutions (if both exist)\n   - Select the smaller value\n\n7. Verify the final answer:\n   - Plug the chosen x value back into the original equation\n   - Confirm that 3|x - 2| indeed equals 15\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct smaller solution for the equation 3|x - 2| = 15 within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully isolated the absolute value term and solved the first case of the absolute value equation. Now we need to focus on the second case to find the other possible solution.\n\nFor Case 2: -(x - 2) = 5\n\nLet's guide the acting agent through the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the equation -(x - 2) = 5\n2. Multiply both sides by -1 to remove the negative sign\n   This will give us: (x - 2) = -5\n3. Now, add 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate x\n   This will result in: x = -5 + 2\n\nBy solving this, we'll have the second possible solution for x. After this calculation, we'll have both solutions and can proceed to compare them to find the smaller one, as required by the original problem.\n",
