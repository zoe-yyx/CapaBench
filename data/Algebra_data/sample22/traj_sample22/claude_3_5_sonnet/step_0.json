    "planning_context": "\nPlan to solve the equation 3|x - 2| = 15:\n\n1. Understand the equation:\n   - We have an absolute value expression |x - 2|\n   - This expression is multiplied by 3\n   - The result equals 15\n\n2. Isolate the absolute value term:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 3\n   - This will give us |x - 2| = 5\n\n3. Consider the two cases of absolute value:\n   a) x - 2 = 5 (when x - 2 is non-negative)\n   b) -(x - 2) = 5 (when x - 2 is negative)\n\n4. Solve each case:\n   a) For x - 2 = 5:\n      - Add 2 to both sides\n      - Solve for x\n   b) For -(x - 2) = 5:\n      - Multiply both sides by -1\n      - Solve for x\n\n5. Check both solutions:\n   - Verify which solution(s) satisfy the original equation\n\n6. Identify the smaller solution:\n   - Compare the two solutions (if both exist)\n   - Select the smaller value\n\n7. Verify the final answer:\n   - Plug the chosen x value back into the original equation\n   - Confirm that 3|x - 2| indeed equals 15\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct smaller solution for the equation 3|x - 2| = 15 within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, our first step is to isolate the absolute value term. We need to divide both sides of the equation 3|x - 2| = 15 by 3. This will simplify our equation and make it easier to solve.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent to perform this division:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation 3|x - 2| = 15 by 3.\n2. This will result in |x - 2| = 15/3.\n3. We need to simplify 15/3.\n\nThis operation will give us a simpler equation to work with, isolating the absolute value term. Once we have this, we can proceed to consider the two cases of the absolute value as outlined in the planning strategy.\n",
