We correctly calculated 30% of 50, which also gave us 15.\n4. We appropriately added these two results together, obtaining 30 as our final answer.\n5. We verified our result by performing the entire calculation in one step: (0.25 * 60) + (0.30 * 50), which confirmed our answer of 30.\n\nOur step-by-step approach aligns perfectly with the original planning strategy, and our final verification ensures the accuracy of our solution. The ambiguity in the original problem regarding the term \"product\" was addressed by interpreting it as a simple calculation of 30% of 50, which is consistent with the problem's overall structure.\n\nAt this point, we have successfully solved the problem and double-checked our work. There are no further calculations or steps needed. The acting agent has completed all necessary actions, and we have a verified, correct answer of 30.\n\nThe next logical step would be to present this final answer and possibly explain the solution process if required.
