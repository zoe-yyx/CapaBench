For part (a):\n   - Convert 25% to a decimal (0.25)\n   - Multiply 0.25 by 60\n\n3. For part (b):\n   - Convert 30% to a decimal (0.30)\n   - Multiply 0.30 by 50\n\n4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3\n\n5. Double-check the calculations using a calculator if needed\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress so far, we have successfully calculated both parts of our problem:\n\n1. 25% of 60 = 15\n2. 30% of 50 = 15\n\nNow, according to our planning strategy, we need to add these two results together to get our final answer. The problem asks us to add 25% of 60 to the product of 30% of 50.\n\nHowever, there's a small ambiguity in the original problem. It asks for the \"product of 30% of 50\", but we've only calculated 30% of 50, not its product with anything else. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that the problem meant to say \"sum\" instead of \"product\", or that we should simply use the result we've calculated.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to add these two results:\n\n15 (from 25% of 60) + 15 (from 30% of 50)\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this addition: 15 + 15\n\nThis calculation will give us our final result, answering the original problem.\n",
