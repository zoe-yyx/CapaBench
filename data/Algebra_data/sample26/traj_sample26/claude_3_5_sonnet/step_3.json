For part (a):\n   - Convert 25% to a decimal (0.25)\n   - Multiply 0.25 by 60\n\n3. For part (b):\n   - Convert 30% to a decimal (0.30)\n   - Multiply 0.30 by 50\n\n4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3\n\n5. Double-check the calculations using a calculator if needed\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",

We calculated 25% of 60, which gave us 15.\n2. We calculated 30% of 50, which also gave us 15.\n3. We added these two results together, obtaining 30.\n\nThe final result of 30 answers the original question: \"Calculate 25% of 60 and add it to the product of 30% of 50.

The acting agent has performed all necessary calculations, and we have our result.\n\nTo ensure completeness and accuracy, we should instruct the acting agent to double-check our work by verifying the entire calculation in one step. This will serve as a final confirmation of our result.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this verification:\n(0.25 * 60) + (0.30 * 50)\n\nThis calculation should yield the same result of 30, confirming our step-by-step solution.\n",
