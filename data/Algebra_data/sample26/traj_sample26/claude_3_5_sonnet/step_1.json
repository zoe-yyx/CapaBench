For part (a):\n   - Convert 25% to a decimal (0.25)\n   - Multiply 0.25 by 60\n\n3. For part (b):\n   - Convert 30% to a decimal (0.30)\n   - Multiply 0.30 by 50\n\n4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3\n\n5. Double-check the calculations using a calculator if needed\n\n6. Present the final answer\n",

Calculate 30% of 50:\n   - We need to convert 30% to a decimal, which is 0.30\n   - Then, we need to multiply 0.30 by 50\n\nThis calculation will give us the second part of our solution. \n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this calculation: 0.30 * 50\n\nOnce we have this result, we'll be ready to add it to the result from the first part (15) to get our final answer.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll be able to proceed to the final step of adding the two results together.\n",
