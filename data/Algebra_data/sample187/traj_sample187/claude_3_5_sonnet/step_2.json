    "planning_context": "\nTo solve this problem and determine the minimum integer value of C, we'll follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Understand the condition for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function equals zero.\n\n2. Set up the equation for the denominator:\n   - x^2 - 3x + C = 0\n\n3. Analyze the discriminant:\n   - For no real roots (and thus no vertical asymptotes), the discriminant must be negative.\n   - Discriminant formula: b^2 - 4ac\n\n4. Form the inequality for the discriminant:\n   - b^2 - 4ac < 0\n\n5. Solve the inequality:\n   - Substitute known values and solve for C\n\n6. Determine the minimum integer value:\n   - Find the smallest integer C that satisfies the inequality\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the function indeed has no vertical asymptotes with the found C value\n\n8. Conclude and present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculations and mathematical reasoning at each step.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculations and reasoning so far, we have determined that C > 2.25 for the function to have no vertical asymptotes. Now, we need to find the minimum integer value of C that satisfies this condition.\n\nGiven that C must be greater than 2.25, and we're looking for an integer value, the minimum integer value of C would be 3.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n1. C = 3 satisfies the inequality C > 2.25\n2. 3 is the smallest integer greater than 2.25\n\nTo further confirm our solution, we should substitute C = 3 back into the original function and check if it indeed has no vertical asymptotes. \n\nThe function with C = 3 would be:\n\nf(x) = (3x-9) / (x^2 - 3x + 3)\n\nTo ensure there are no vertical asymptotes, we need to verify that the denominator never equals zero for any real value of x. This means the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x + 3 = 0 should have no real roots.\n\nWe can check this by calculating the discriminant of this quadratic equation. If the discriminant is negative, it confirms that there are no real roots, and thus no vertical asymptotes.\n\nThe discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac, where a = 1, b = -3, and c = 3.\n\nThe next step should be to calculate this discriminant to verify our solution.\n",
