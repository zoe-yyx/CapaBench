    "planning_context": "\nTo solve this problem and determine the minimum integer value of C, we'll follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Understand the condition for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function equals zero.\n\n2. Set up the equation for the denominator:\n   - x^2 - 3x + C = 0\n\n3. Analyze the discriminant:\n   - For no real roots (and thus no vertical asymptotes), the discriminant must be negative.\n   - Discriminant formula: b^2 - 4ac\n\n4. Form the inequality for the discriminant:\n   - b^2 - 4ac < 0\n\n5. Solve the inequality:\n   - Substitute known values and solve for C\n\n6. Determine the minimum integer value:\n   - Find the smallest integer C that satisfies the inequality\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the function indeed has no vertical asymptotes with the found C value\n\n8. Conclude and present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculations and mathematical reasoning at each step.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to focus on the denominator of the rational function, as that's where vertical asymptotes can occur. The denominator is x^2 - 3x + C.\n\nFor the function to have no vertical asymptotes, this quadratic expression should never equal zero for any real value of x. This means the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x + C = 0 should have no real roots.\n\nTo ensure no real roots, we need to make the discriminant of this quadratic equation negative. The discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in standard form (ax^2 + bx + c).\n\nIn our case:\na = 1\nb = -3\nc = C\n\nLet's set up the inequality for a negative discriminant:\n\nb^2 - 4ac < 0\n\nSubstituting our values:\n\n(-3)^2 - 4(1)(C) < 0\n\nThe next step should be to simplify this inequality and solve for C. This will involve basic algebra and potentially some numerical calculations.\n",
