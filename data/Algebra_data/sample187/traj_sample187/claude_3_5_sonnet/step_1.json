    "planning_context": "\nTo solve this problem and determine the minimum integer value of C, we'll follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Understand the condition for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function equals zero.\n\n2. Set up the equation for the denominator:\n   - x^2 - 3x + C = 0\n\n3. Analyze the discriminant:\n   - For no real roots (and thus no vertical asymptotes), the discriminant must be negative.\n   - Discriminant formula: b^2 - 4ac\n\n4. Form the inequality for the discriminant:\n   - b^2 - 4ac < 0\n\n5. Solve the inequality:\n   - Substitute known values and solve for C\n\n6. Determine the minimum integer value:\n   - Find the smallest integer C that satisfies the inequality\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the function indeed has no vertical asymptotes with the found C value\n\n8. Conclude and present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculations and mathematical reasoning at each step.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result from the previous step, we can now proceed with our reasoning:\n\n1. We have established that for no vertical asymptotes, we need the discriminant to be negative:\n   (-3)^2 - 4(1)(C) < 0\n\n2. We now know that (-3)^2 = 9, so we can substitute this value:\n   9 - 4(1)(C) < 0\n\n3. Our next step should be to simplify this inequality and solve for C. Let's break it down:\n\n   9 - 4C < 0\n   -4C < -9\n   4C > 9\n\n4. Dividing both sides by 4:\n   C > 9/4 = 2.25\n\n5. Since we're asked for the minimum integer value of C, we need to find the smallest integer greater than 2.25.\n\nTherefore, our next action should be to determine the smallest integer greater than 2.25. This will give us the minimum integer value of C that ensures no vertical asymptotes.\n",
