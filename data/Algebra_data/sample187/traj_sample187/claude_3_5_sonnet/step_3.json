    "planning_context": "\nTo solve this problem and determine the minimum integer value of C, we'll follow these strategic steps:\n\n1. Understand the condition for vertical asymptotes:\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function equals zero.\n\n2. Set up the equation for the denominator:\n   - x^2 - 3x + C = 0\n\n3. Analyze the discriminant:\n   - For no real roots (and thus no vertical asymptotes), the discriminant must be negative.\n   - Discriminant formula: b^2 - 4ac\n\n4. Form the inequality for the discriminant:\n   - b^2 - 4ac < 0\n\n5. Solve the inequality:\n   - Substitute known values and solve for C\n\n6. Determine the minimum integer value:\n   - Find the smallest integer C that satisfies the inequality\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the function indeed has no vertical asymptotes with the found C value\n\n8. Conclude and present the final answer\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing calculations and mathematical reasoning at each step.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the calculation result from the previous step, we can now confirm our solution:\n\n1. We calculated the discriminant for the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x + 3 = 0:\n   (-3)^2 - 4 * 1 * 3 = -3\n\n2. The discriminant is negative (-3), which confirms that the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x + 3 = 0 has no real roots.\n\n3. This means that when C = 3, the denominator of our original function f(x) = (3x-9) / (x^2 - 3x + C) never equals zero for any real value of x.\n\n4. Therefore, the function f(x) = (3x-9) / (x^2 - 3x + 3) has no vertical asymptotes.\n\n5. We have already established that 3 is the minimum integer value greater than 2.25, which was our original condition for C.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can confidently conclude that the minimum integer value of C such that the rational function f(x) = (3x-9) / (x^2 - 3x + C) has no vertical asymptotes is 3.\n\nNo further calculations or actions are needed. The acting agent can now present this as the final answer to the original problem.\n",
