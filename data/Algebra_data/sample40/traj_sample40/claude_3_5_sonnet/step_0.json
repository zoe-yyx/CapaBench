Simplify the numerator:\n   - Group positive and negative terms\n   - Calculate the sum\n\n3. Simplify the denominator:\n   - Group positive and negative terms\n   - Calculate the sum\n\n4. Check if the simplified fraction can be reduced:\n   - Determine if there are common factors in the numerator and denominator\n\n5. Write the final simplified fraction\n\n6. Double-check the result:\n   - Ensure all calculations are correct\n   - Verify that the simplified fraction is equivalent to the original expression\n",
