    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the concept:\n   - Recall that direct proportionality means the ratio between m and n is constant.\n\n2. Establish the relationship:\n   - Use the given information (m = 18 when n = 4) to find the constant of proportionality.\n\n3. Set up the equation:\n   - Express the relationship between m and n using the constant of proportionality.\n\n4. Solve for the unknown:\n   - Use the equation to find m when n = 16.\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the answer maintains the same ratio as the given information.\n\nExecution steps:\n1. Calculate the constant of proportionality (k) using m = 18 and n = 4.\n2. Write the general equation for the relationship between m and n.\n3. Substitute n = 16 into the equation and solve for m.\n4. Verify that the ratio of the new m and n values matches the original ratio.\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within 4-5 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to establish the relationship between m and n using the given information. We know that m and n are directly proportional, which means their ratio is constant. Let's call this constant k.\n\nWe're given that m = 18 when n = 4. We can use this to find the constant of proportionality k.\n\nThe next logical step is to calculate this constant k using the formula:\n\nk = m / n = 18 / 4\n\nThis calculation will give us the constant of proportionality, which is crucial for setting up the general equation that relates m and n. Once we have this constant, we can use it to find m for any given value of n, including when n = 16.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division: 18 \u00f7 4.\n",
