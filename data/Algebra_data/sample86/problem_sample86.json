    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By the definition of direct proportion, $m = kn$ for some constant $k$. Substituting the given values, we find $k$ as $k = \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{18}{4} = 4.5$. Using this $k$ value, we can solve for $m$ when $n=16$: \\[m = 4.5 \\cdot 16 = \\boxed{72}.\\]",
