    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 15\n   - 8th term (a8) = 40\n   - Need to find sum of first 10 terms\n\n2. Determine the common difference (d):\n   - Use the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Set up equation using 3rd and 8th terms\n   - Solve for d\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use the formula for 3rd term: a3 = a1 + 2d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for a1\n\n4. Calculate the 10th term (a10):\n   - Use the formula: a10 = a1 + 9d\n\n5. Apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula:\n   - Sn = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   - S10 = 10(a1 + a10) / 2\n\n6. Perform final calculation to get the sum of first 10 terms\n\n7. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for computations as needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our comprehensive calculations and verifications, we have confidently solved the problem and confirmed our solution. Let's summarize our reasoning process:\n\n1. We successfully determined the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence as 5.\n2. We calculated the first term (a1) as 5.\n3. We found the 10th term (a10) to be 50.\n4. We applied the arithmetic sequence sum formula: S10 = 10(5 + 50) / 2, which gave us 275.\n5. We verified our solution by calculating additional terms (2nd, 4th, and 5th) to confirm the pattern.\n6. Finally, we manually summed the first 10 terms of the sequence, which also resulted in 275.\n\nAll of these steps consistently support our solution that the sum of the first 10 terms of the given arithmetic sequence is 275. This answer satisfies all the conditions in the original problem:\n- The 3rd term is 15 (verified)\n- The 8th term is 40 (verified)\n- The sequence follows the arithmetic progression with a common difference of 5\n\nAt this point, we have exhaustively verified our solution from multiple angles. There are no further calculations or verifications needed. The problem has been solved completely and accurately.\n\nThe acting agent can now confidently present 275 as the final answer to the original problem: the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence with its 3rd term as 15 and its 8th term as 40.\n",
