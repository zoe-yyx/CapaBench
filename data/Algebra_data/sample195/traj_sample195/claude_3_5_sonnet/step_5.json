    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 15\n   - 8th term (a8) = 40\n   - Need to find sum of first 10 terms\n\n2. Determine the common difference (d):\n   - Use the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Set up equation using 3rd and 8th terms\n   - Solve for d\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use the formula for 3rd term: a3 = a1 + 2d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for a1\n\n4. Calculate the 10th term (a10):\n   - Use the formula: a10 = a1 + 9d\n\n5. Apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula:\n   - Sn = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   - S10 = 10(a1 + a10) / 2\n\n6. Perform final calculation to get the sum of first 10 terms\n\n7. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for computations as needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our previous calculations and the double-checking suggestion, we have confirmed that a2 = 10, which is consistent with our findings. Now, let's continue verifying the 4th and 5th terms as suggested:\n\n1. We've already calculated a2 = 10\n2. For a4: a4 = 5 + (4-1)*5 = 5 + 15 = 20\n3. For a5: a5 = 5 + (5-1)*5 = 5 + 20 = 25\n\nThese calculations further confirm the pattern of our arithmetic sequence. Let's analyze:\n\n- The common difference (5) is consistently added between each term.\n- a3 = 15 (as given in the original problem)\n- a4 = 20 (which we just calculated)\n- a5 = 25 (which we just calculated)\n- a8 = 40 (as given in the original problem)\n\nThis pattern is consistent with our solution and the original problem statement. \n\nNow that we have thoroughly verified our solution, we can confidently state that our answer of 275 for the sum of the first 10 terms is correct.\n\nTo provide a final, comprehensive verification, the acting agent should calculate the sum of these first 10 terms manually:\n5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 50\n\nThis manual calculation will serve as a final check to ensure our formula-based solution is accurate.\n",
