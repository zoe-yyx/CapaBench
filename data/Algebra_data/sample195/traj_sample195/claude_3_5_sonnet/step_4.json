    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 15\n   - 8th term (a8) = 40\n   - Need to find sum of first 10 terms\n\n2. Determine the common difference (d):\n   - Use the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Set up equation using 3rd and 8th terms\n   - Solve for d\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use the formula for 3rd term: a3 = a1 + 2d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for a1\n\n4. Calculate the 10th term (a10):\n   - Use the formula: a10 = a1 + 9d\n\n5. Apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula:\n   - Sn = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   - S10 = 10(a1 + a10) / 2\n\n6. Perform final calculation to get the sum of first 10 terms\n\n7. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for computations as needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nExcellent! We've successfully completed all the necessary calculations to solve the problem. Let's summarize our findings and confirm our solution:\n\n1. We found the common difference (d) = 5\n2. We calculated the first term (a1) = 5\n3. We determined the 10th term (a10) = 50\n4. We applied the arithmetic sequence sum formula: S10 = 10(5 + 50) / 2\n5. We calculated the sum of the first 10 terms: 275\n\nOur solution shows that the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence is 275. This answer satisfies all the conditions given in the original problem:\n- The 3rd term is 15 (which can be verified: a3 = 5 + 2*5 = 15)\n- The 8th term is 40 (which can be verified: a8 = 5 + 7*5 = 40)\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of our solution, we should double-check our work by calculating a few more terms of the sequence and verifying that they follow the pattern we've established. \n\nThe acting agent should calculate the 2nd, 4th, and 5th terms of the sequence using the formula an = a1 + (n-1)d:\n\n1. Calculate a2 = 5 + (2-1)*5\n2. Calculate a4 = 5 + (4-1)*5\n3. Calculate a5 = 5 + (5-1)*5\n\nThis will help us confirm that our solution is consistent with the given information and the properties of an arithmetic sequence.\n",
