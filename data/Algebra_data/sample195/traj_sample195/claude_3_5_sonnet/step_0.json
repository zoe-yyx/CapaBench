    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 15\n   - 8th term (a8) = 40\n   - Need to find sum of first 10 terms\n\n2. Determine the common difference (d):\n   - Use the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Set up equation using 3rd and 8th terms\n   - Solve for d\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use the formula for 3rd term: a3 = a1 + 2d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for a1\n\n4. Calculate the 10th term (a10):\n   - Use the formula: a10 = a1 + 9d\n\n5. Apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula:\n   - Sn = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   - S10 = 10(a1 + a10) / 2\n\n6. Perform final calculation to get the sum of first 10 terms\n\n7. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for computations as needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, our first step should be to determine the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence. We have two known terms: the 3rd term (a3) is 15 and the 8th term (a8) is 40.\n\nWe can use the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n\nFor the 3rd term: a3 = a1 + 2d\nFor the 8th term: a8 = a1 + 7d\n\nWe can set up an equation:\na8 - a3 = (a1 + 7d) - (a1 + 2d)\n40 - 15 = 5d\n25 = 5d\n\nTo solve for d, we need to divide 25 by 5. This will give us the common difference of the sequence.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division: 25 \u00f7 5\n",
