    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 15\n   - 8th term (a8) = 40\n   - Need to find sum of first 10 terms\n\n2. Determine the common difference (d):\n   - Use the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Set up equation using 3rd and 8th terms\n   - Solve for d\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use the formula for 3rd term: a3 = a1 + 2d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for a1\n\n4. Calculate the 10th term (a10):\n   - Use the formula: a10 = a1 + 9d\n\n5. Apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula:\n   - Sn = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   - S10 = 10(a1 + a10) / 2\n\n6. Perform final calculation to get the sum of first 10 terms\n\n7. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for computations as needed.\n",
