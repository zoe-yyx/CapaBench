    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify key information:\n   - 3rd term (a3) = 15\n   - 8th term (a8) = 40\n   - Need to find sum of first 10 terms\n\n2. Determine the common difference (d):\n   - Use the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d\n   - Set up equation using 3rd and 8th terms\n   - Solve for d\n\n3. Find the first term (a1):\n   - Use the formula for 3rd term: a3 = a1 + 2d\n   - Substitute known values and solve for a1\n\n4. Calculate the 10th term (a10):\n   - Use the formula: a10 = a1 + 9d\n\n5. Apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula:\n   - Sn = n(a1 + an) / 2\n   - S10 = 10(a1 + a10) / 2\n\n6. Perform final calculation to get the sum of first 10 terms\n\n7. Double-check the result for accuracy\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing the calculator for computations as needed.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nExcellent progress so far. We've successfully determined the common difference (d = 5), the first term (a1 = 5), and now we've calculated the 10th term (a10 = 50).\n\nWith these key pieces of information, we're now ready to apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula to find the sum of the first 10 terms.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is:\nSn = n(a1 + an) / 2\n\nWhere:\nn = number of terms (in this case, 10)\na1 = first term (which we found to be 5)\nan = last term in the sum (in this case, a10 = 50)\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n\nS10 = 10(5 + 50) / 2\n\nTo solve this, we need to:\n1. Add 5 and 50\n2. Multiply the result by 10\n3. Divide the final result by 2\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations in this order:\n1. Calculate 5 + 50\n2. Multiply the result by 10\n3. Divide the final result by 2\n\nThis will give us the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic sequence, which is our final answer to the problem.\n",
