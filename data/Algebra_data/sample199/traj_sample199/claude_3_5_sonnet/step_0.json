    "observation": "Three team members are planning to equally distribute a $140$-page report for proofreading. However, due to the expertise required, Member 1 takes twice as many pages as Member 2, and Member 3 takes five pages less than Member 1. How many pages does Member 3 proofread?",
    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Page Distribution Problem:\n\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - Total pages: 140\n   - Distribution is not equal\n   - Member 1 takes twice as many pages as Member 2\n   - Member 3 takes 5 pages less than Member 1\n\n2. Set up variables:\n   - Let x = number of pages Member 2 proofreads\n   - Then, 2x = number of pages Member 1 proofreads\n   - And, (2x - 5) = number of pages Member 3 proofreads\n\n3. Create an equation:\n   - Total pages = Member 1 + Member 2 + Member 3\n   - 140 = 2x + x + (2x - 5)\n\n4. Solve the equation:\n   - Simplify the right side of the equation\n   - Isolate x\n   - Calculate the value of x (pages for Member 2)\n\n5. Calculate pages for Member 1:\n   - Member 1's pages = 2x\n\n6. Calculate pages for Member 3:\n   - Member 3's pages = 2x - 5\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if Member 1's pages + Member 2's pages + Member 3's pages = 140\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - State how many pages Member 3 proofreads\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within the 10-round limit, utilizing algebraic reasoning and basic arithmetic operations.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin solving this problem, we need to set up and solve the equation as outlined in steps 3 and 4 of our plan. Let's start by writing out the equation:\n\n140 = 2x + x + (2x - 5)\n\nThis equation represents the total number of pages (140) being equal to the sum of pages read by all three members. We should now simplify the right side of the equation by combining like terms:\n\n140 = 2x + x + 2x - 5\n140 = 5x - 5\n\nThe next step would be to isolate x by adding 5 to both sides and then dividing by 5. This will give us the value of x, which represents the number of pages Member 2 proofreads. Once we have this, we can easily calculate the pages for Member 1 and Member 3.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these operations:\n1. Add 5 to both sides: 140 + 5 = 5x\n2. Divide both sides by 5: (145) \u00f7 5 = x\n\nThis will give us the value of x, which is crucial for determining the number of pages each member proofreads.\n",
