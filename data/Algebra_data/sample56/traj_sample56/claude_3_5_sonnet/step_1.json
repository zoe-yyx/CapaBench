Recall the midpoint formula:\n   The midpoint formula for two points (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082) is:\n   Midpoint = ((x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2, (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2)\n\n2. Identify the given points:\n   Point 1: (2, -5)\n   Point 2: (-4, 9)\n\n3. Apply the midpoint formula:\n   a. Calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint:\n      x = (x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2 = (2 + (-4))/2\n   \n   b. Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint:\n      y = (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2 = (-5 + 9)/2\n\n4. Perform the calculations:\n   Use a calculator if needed to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   Write the midpoint as an ordered pair (x, y).\n\n6. Double-check the result:\n   Verify that the midpoint is indeed equidistant from both given points.\n",
