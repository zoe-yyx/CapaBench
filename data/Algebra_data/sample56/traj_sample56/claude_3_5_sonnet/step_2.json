    "planning_context": "\n1. Recall the midpoint formula:\n   The midpoint formula for two points (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082) is:\n   Midpoint = ((x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2, (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2)\n\n2. Identify the given points:\n   Point 1: (2, -5)\n   Point 2: (-4, 9)\n\n3. Apply the midpoint formula:\n   a. Calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint:\n      x = (x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2 = (2 + (-4))/2\n   \n   b. Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint:\n      y = (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2 = (-5 + 9)/2\n\n4. Perform the calculations:\n   Use a calculator if needed to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. Express the final answer:\n   Write the midpoint as an ordered pair (x, y).\n\n6. Double-check the result:\n   Verify that the midpoint is indeed equidistant from both given points.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress so far, we have successfully calculated both coordinates of the midpoint:\n\n1. x-coordinate: (2 + (-4)) / 2 = -1\n2. y-coordinate: (-5 + 9) / 2 = 2\n\nNow that we have both coordinates, we can express the midpoint as an ordered pair. The midpoint formula has been correctly applied, and we have our result.\n\nThe next step is to present the final answer in the proper format. We should guide the acting agent to combine these coordinates into an ordered pair (x, y).\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial to verify that this point is indeed equidistant from both given points, (2, -5) and (-4, 9), as a way to double-check our result. This can be done by calculating the distance from the midpoint to each of the given points using the distance formula.\n\nLet's proceed with expressing the final answer and then suggest a verification step.\n",
