    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - The length is 14 feet more than twice the width\n   - The area is 240 square feet\n\n2. Define variables:\n   - Let w = width of the garden\n   - Let l = length of the garden\n\n3. Set up equations:\n   - Length equation: l = 2w + 14\n   - Area equation: l * w = 240\n\n4. Substitute the length equation into the area equation:\n   - (2w + 14) * w = 240\n\n5. Expand the equation:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w = 240\n\n6. Rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w - 240 = 0\n\n7. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: w = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 2, b = 14, and c = -240\n\n8. Calculate the width (w) using the quadratic formula\n\n9. Calculate the length (l) using the length equation: l = 2w + 14\n\n10. Determine which dimension (length or width) is larger and report it as the answer\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for steps 8 and 9 to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nExcellent progress so far. We've set up the quadratic equation and begun solving it using the quadratic formula. Let's continue with the next steps in our reasoning:\n\n1. We've calculated the value under the square root: 2116\n\n2. Now, we need to complete the quadratic formula:\n   w = [-14 \u00b1 \u221a2116] / (2*2)\n\n3. To solve this, we need to:\n   a) Calculate the square root of 2116\n   b) Add and subtract this value from -14\n   c) Divide the results by 4\n\n4. After finding the two possible values for w, we need to:\n   a) Determine which value of w is positive and realistic for a garden width\n   b) Calculate the corresponding length using l = 2w + 14\n\n5. Finally, we'll compare the length and width to determine the larger dimension\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations step by step, showing all work. They should start by calculating the square root of 2116, then proceed with the rest of the quadratic formula calculation.\n",
