    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - The length is 14 feet more than twice the width\n   - The area is 240 square feet\n\n2. Define variables:\n   - Let w = width of the garden\n   - Let l = length of the garden\n\n3. Set up equations:\n   - Length equation: l = 2w + 14\n   - Area equation: l * w = 240\n\n4. Substitute the length equation into the area equation:\n   - (2w + 14) * w = 240\n\n5. Expand the equation:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w = 240\n\n6. Rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w - 240 = 0\n\n7. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: w = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 2, b = 14, and c = -240\n\n8. Calculate the width (w) using the quadratic formula\n\n9. Calculate the length (l) using the length equation: l = 2w + 14\n\n10. Determine which dimension (length or width) is larger and report it as the answer\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for steps 8 and 9 to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGreat progress so far. We've calculated the value under the square root and its square root. Now let's continue with solving the quadratic equation:\n\n1. We have w = [-14 \u00b1 \u221a2116] / (2*2)\n   We know \u221a2116 = 46\n\n2. Let's substitute this value:\n   w = [-14 \u00b1 46] / 4\n\n3. This gives us two equations:\n   w = (-14 + 46) / 4  and  w = (-14 - 46) / 4\n\n4. We need to calculate both of these values to find the positive, realistic width for the garden.\n\n5. After finding w, we'll calculate l using l = 2w + 14\n\n6. Then we'll compare l and w to determine the larger dimension.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to:\na) Calculate (-14 + 46) / 4\nb) Calculate (-14 - 46) / 4\nc) Identify the positive result as the width\nd) Calculate the length using l = 2w + 14 with the positive width\n\nEach step should be shown clearly.\n",
