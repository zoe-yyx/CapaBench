    "observation": "A garden is being designed such that its length is 14 feet more than twice its width, and the area is 240 square feet. What are the larger dimension of the garden?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - The length is 14 feet more than twice the width\n   - The area is 240 square feet\n\n2. Define variables:\n   - Let w = width of the garden\n   - Let l = length of the garden\n\n3. Set up equations:\n   - Length equation: l = 2w + 14\n   - Area equation: l * w = 240\n\n4. Substitute the length equation into the area equation:\n   - (2w + 14) * w = 240\n\n5. Expand the equation:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w = 240\n\n6. Rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w - 240 = 0\n\n7. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: w = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 2, b = 14, and c = -240\n\n8. Calculate the width (w) using the quadratic formula\n\n9. Calculate the length (l) using the length equation: l = 2w + 14\n\n10. Determine which dimension (length or width) is larger and report it as the answer\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for steps 8 and 9 to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on our calculations so far, we have successfully determined both dimensions of the garden:\n\n1. Width (w) = 8 feet\n2. Length (l) = 2 * 8 + 14 = 30 feet\n\nNow, we can directly answer the question asked in the original problem. Let's reason through the final steps:\n\n1. We have calculated both dimensions of the garden:\n   - Width = 8 feet\n   - Length = 30 feet\n\n2. The question asks for the larger dimension of the garden.\n\n3. Comparing the two dimensions:\n   30 feet (length) is greater than 8 feet (width)\n\n4. Therefore, the length is the larger dimension of the garden.\n\nThe acting agent should now formulate the final answer, stating that the larger dimension of the garden is the length, which is 30 feet. This completes our problem-solving process, addressing all steps in the original planning strategy and directly answering the question posed in the problem.\n",
