    "observation": "A garden is being designed such that its length is 14 feet more than twice its width, and the area is 240 square feet. What are the larger dimension of the garden?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - The length is 14 feet more than twice the width\n   - The area is 240 square feet\n\n2. Define variables:\n   - Let w = width of the garden\n   - Let l = length of the garden\n\n3. Set up equations:\n   - Length equation: l = 2w + 14\n   - Area equation: l * w = 240\n\n4. Substitute the length equation into the area equation:\n   - (2w + 14) * w = 240\n\n5. Expand the equation:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w = 240\n\n6. Rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w - 240 = 0\n\n7. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: w = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 2, b = 14, and c = -240\n\n8. Calculate the width (w) using the quadratic formula\n\n9. Calculate the length (l) using the length equation: l = 2w + 14\n\n10. Determine which dimension (length or width) is larger and report it as the answer\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for steps 8 and 9 to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the progress so far, we've successfully solved for the width of the garden. Let's continue our reasoning:\n\n1. We've calculated (-14 + 46) / 4 = 8, which gives us the positive, realistic value for the width (w) of the garden.\n\n2. We don't need to calculate (-14 - 46) / 4 as it would give us a negative value, which is not realistic for a garden dimension.\n\n3. Now that we have the width (w = 8 feet), we need to calculate the length (l) using the equation: l = 2w + 14\n\n4. After calculating the length, we'll have both dimensions of the garden and can determine which one is larger.\n\n5. Remember, the question asks for the larger dimension of the garden.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to:\na) Calculate the length using l = 2(8) + 14\nb) Compare the calculated length with the width (8 feet) to determine which is larger\n\nThe acting agent should show the calculation for the length and clearly state which dimension is larger.\n",
