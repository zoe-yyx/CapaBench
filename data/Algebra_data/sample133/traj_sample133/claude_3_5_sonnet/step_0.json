    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key information:\n   - The length is 14 feet more than twice the width\n   - The area is 240 square feet\n\n2. Define variables:\n   - Let w = width of the garden\n   - Let l = length of the garden\n\n3. Set up equations:\n   - Length equation: l = 2w + 14\n   - Area equation: l * w = 240\n\n4. Substitute the length equation into the area equation:\n   - (2w + 14) * w = 240\n\n5. Expand the equation:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w = 240\n\n6. Rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n   - 2w^2 + 14w - 240 = 0\n\n7. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   - Use the quadratic formula: w = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   - Where a = 2, b = 14, and c = -240\n\n8. Calculate the width (w) using the quadratic formula\n\n9. Calculate the length (l) using the length equation: l = 2w + 14\n\n10. Determine which dimension (length or width) is larger and report it as the answer\n\nNote: The acting agent should use a calculator for steps 8 and 9 to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy, we should start by setting up and solving the quadratic equation. The key steps are:\n\n1. We have the quadratic equation: 2w^2 + 14w - 240 = 0\n\n2. We need to use the quadratic formula: w = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n   Where a = 2, b = 14, and c = -240\n\n3. To solve this, we need to calculate:\n   - b^2 = 14^2\n   - 4ac = 4 * 2 * (-240)\n   - \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)\n   - -b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)\n   - Finally, divide by 2a\n\n4. Once we have the value of w (width), we can calculate l (length) using l = 2w + 14\n\n5. After calculating both dimensions, we can determine which one is larger\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these calculations accurately. They should show each step of the calculation process, starting with the values inside the square root, then the full quadratic formula, and finally calculating the length.\n",
