    "observation": "In a football team, the number of defenders is twice the number of goalkeepers and the number of midfielders is 5 less than three times the number of goalkeepers. If the total number of defenders, goalkeepers, and midfielders is 25, how many midfielders are there in the team?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x = number of goalkeepers\n   - Defenders = 2x\n   - Midfielders = 3x - 5\n\n2. Set up an equation based on the total number of players:\n   x + 2x + (3x - 5) = 25\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   6x - 5 = 25\n\n4. Solve for x (number of goalkeepers):\n   6x = 30\n   x = 5\n\n5. Calculate the number of midfielders:\n   Midfielders = 3x - 5\n   Substitute x = 5 into this formula\n\n6. Perform the final calculation to get the number of midfielders\n\n7. Double-check the result by ensuring the total of goalkeepers, defenders, and midfielders equals 25\n\n8. Present the final answer: the number of midfielders in the team\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the planning strategy, we have successfully completed all the steps and verified our solution. Let's summarize our reasoning:\n\n1. We set up the equation: x + 2x + (3x - 5) = 25, where x represents the number of goalkeepers.\n2. We simplified the equation to 6x - 5 = 25.\n3. We solved for x and found that x = 5, meaning there are 5 goalkeepers.\n4. We calculated the number of midfielders using the formula 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10.\n5. We verified our answer by checking that the total number of players (goalkeepers + defenders + midfielders) equals 25:\n   5 (goalkeepers) + 10 (defenders) + 10 (midfielders) = 25\n\nOur reasoning and calculations are complete and verified. We have successfully solved the problem and can confidently state that there are 10 midfielders in the team.\n\nThe next logical step would be for the acting agent to present this final answer, as outlined in step 8 of our planning strategy. No further calculations or verifications are needed at this point.\n",
