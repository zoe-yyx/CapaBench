    "observation": "In a football team, the number of defenders is twice the number of goalkeepers and the number of midfielders is 5 less than three times the number of goalkeepers. If the total number of defenders, goalkeepers, and midfielders is 25, how many midfielders are there in the team?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x = number of goalkeepers\n   - Defenders = 2x\n   - Midfielders = 3x - 5\n\n2. Set up an equation based on the total number of players:\n   x + 2x + (3x - 5) = 25\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   6x - 5 = 25\n\n4. Solve for x (number of goalkeepers):\n   6x = 30\n   x = 5\n\n5. Calculate the number of midfielders:\n   Midfielders = 3x - 5\n   Substitute x = 5 into this formula\n\n6. Perform the final calculation to get the number of midfielders\n\n7. Double-check the result by ensuring the total of goalkeepers, defenders, and midfielders equals 25\n\n8. Present the final answer: the number of midfielders in the team\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the planning strategy, we have successfully calculated the number of midfielders in the team, which is 10. This is the answer to our original question. However, to ensure the accuracy of our solution, we should follow step 7 of our planning strategy and double-check the result.\n\nTo verify our answer, we need to ensure that the total number of goalkeepers, defenders, and midfielders equals 25, as stated in the original problem. Let's break this down:\n\n1. Goalkeepers: We found that x = 5, so there are 5 goalkeepers.\n2. Defenders: The number of defenders is twice the number of goalkeepers, so it's 2 * 5 = 10 defenders.\n3. Midfielders: We calculated this to be 10.\n\nNow, we need to sum these numbers to verify that they total 25. The acting agent should use a calculator to add:\n\n5 (goalkeepers) + 10 (defenders) + 10 (midfielders)\n\nIf this sum equals 25, our solution is correct and we can confidently present the final answer: there are 10 midfielders in the team.\n",
