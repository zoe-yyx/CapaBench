    "observation": "In a football team, the number of defenders is twice the number of goalkeepers and the number of midfielders is 5 less than three times the number of goalkeepers. If the total number of defenders, goalkeepers, and midfielders is 25, how many midfielders are there in the team?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x = number of goalkeepers\n   - Defenders = 2x\n   - Midfielders = 3x - 5\n\n2. Set up an equation based on the total number of players:\n   x + 2x + (3x - 5) = 25\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   6x - 5 = 25\n\n4. Solve for x (number of goalkeepers):\n   6x = 30\n   x = 5\n\n5. Calculate the number of midfielders:\n   Midfielders = 3x - 5\n   Substitute x = 5 into this formula\n\n6. Perform the final calculation to get the number of midfielders\n\n7. Double-check the result by ensuring the total of goalkeepers, defenders, and midfielders equals 25\n\n8. Present the final answer: the number of midfielders in the team\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the planning strategy, we have successfully set up and simplified the equation to 6x - 5 = 25. The next logical step is to solve this equation for x, which represents the number of goalkeepers.\n\nTo solve for x:\n1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 6x = 30\n2. Divide both sides by 6: x = 30 / 6\n\nOnce we have the value of x, we can use it to calculate the number of midfielders using the formula: Midfielders = 3x - 5\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should now:\n1. Use a calculator to divide 30 by 6 to find the value of x (number of goalkeepers).\n2. Once x is known, use the calculator again to compute 3x - 5 to find the number of midfielders.\n\nThese calculations will give us the final answer to the problem.\n",
