    "observation": "In a football team, the number of defenders is twice the number of goalkeepers and the number of midfielders is 5 less than three times the number of goalkeepers. If the total number of defenders, goalkeepers, and midfielders is 25, how many midfielders are there in the team?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x = number of goalkeepers\n   - Defenders = 2x\n   - Midfielders = 3x - 5\n\n2. Set up an equation based on the total number of players:\n   x + 2x + (3x - 5) = 25\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   6x - 5 = 25\n\n4. Solve for x (number of goalkeepers):\n   6x = 30\n   x = 5\n\n5. Calculate the number of midfielders:\n   Midfielders = 3x - 5\n   Substitute x = 5 into this formula\n\n6. Perform the final calculation to get the number of midfielders\n\n7. Double-check the result by ensuring the total of goalkeepers, defenders, and midfielders equals 25\n\n8. Present the final answer: the number of midfielders in the team\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the planning strategy, we have successfully solved for x, which represents the number of goalkeepers. We found that x = 5.\n\nNow, we need to use this value to calculate the number of midfielders. According to our original formula:\n\nMidfielders = 3x - 5\n\nWe can now substitute x = 5 into this formula:\n\nMidfielders = 3(5) - 5\n\nThe next logical step is to perform this calculation to find the final answer. The acting agent should use a calculator to:\n\n1. Multiply 3 by 5\n2. Subtract 5 from the result\n\nThis calculation will give us the number of midfielders in the team, which is the answer to our original question.\n\nAfter this calculation, we should also verify our answer by checking if the total number of players (goalkeepers + defenders + midfielders) equals 25, as stated in the original problem.\n",
