    "observation": "In a football team, the number of defenders is twice the number of goalkeepers and the number of midfielders is 5 less than three times the number of goalkeepers. If the total number of defenders, goalkeepers, and midfielders is 25, how many midfielders are there in the team?",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the key variables:\n   - Let x = number of goalkeepers\n   - Defenders = 2x\n   - Midfielders = 3x - 5\n\n2. Set up an equation based on the total number of players:\n   x + 2x + (3x - 5) = 25\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   6x - 5 = 25\n\n4. Solve for x (number of goalkeepers):\n   6x = 30\n   x = 5\n\n5. Calculate the number of midfielders:\n   Midfielders = 3x - 5\n   Substitute x = 5 into this formula\n\n6. Perform the final calculation to get the number of midfielders\n\n7. Double-check the result by ensuring the total of goalkeepers, defenders, and midfielders equals 25\n\n8. Present the final answer: the number of midfielders in the team\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by setting up the equation using the given information. The plan outlines that we need to use x as the number of goalkeepers, 2x as the number of defenders, and 3x - 5 as the number of midfielders.\n\nThe next logical step is to form the equation:\nx + 2x + (3x - 5) = 25\n\nThis equation represents the total number of players (25) as the sum of goalkeepers (x), defenders (2x), and midfielders (3x - 5).\n\nThe acting agent should now simplify this equation by combining like terms. This will lead us to the simplified form 6x - 5 = 25, as mentioned in step 3 of the planning strategy.\n\nAfter simplification, we'll be ready to solve for x, which represents the number of goalkeepers. This value will be crucial for determining the number of midfielders.\n",
