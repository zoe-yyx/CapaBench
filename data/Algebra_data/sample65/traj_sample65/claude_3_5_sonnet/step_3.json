    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the expression:\n   - Identify the base of the outer exponent (2)\n   - Identify the inner logarithm (log_4 64)\n\n2. Simplify the inner logarithm:\n   - Recognize that 64 is a power of 4 (4^3 = 64)\n   - Use the property of logarithms to simplify log_4 64\n\n3. Apply the properties of exponents:\n   - Use the result from step 2 to simplify the overall expression\n\n4. Calculate the final result:\n   - Perform any necessary calculations to obtain the numerical answer\n\n5. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if the result makes sense in the context of the original problem\n   - Confirm that 2 raised to the power of the simplified logarithm equals the final answer\n\nNote: This problem can likely be solved in fewer than 5 steps, but we've included verification as good mathematical practice.\n",
