We have our final answer: 2^(log_4 64) = 8.\n2. To verify this result, we should check if it satisfies the original equation.\n3. We can do this by calculating 4^3 (since log_4 64 = 3) and confirming it equals 64.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to verify our solution. We should instruct the acting agent to use a calculator to compute 4^3.
