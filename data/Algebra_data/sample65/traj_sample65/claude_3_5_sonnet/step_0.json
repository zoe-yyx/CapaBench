We need to focus on simplifying the inner logarithm first: log_4 64\n\n2. We can recognize that 64 is indeed a power of 4. Specifically, 4^3 = 64.\n\n3. Using the property of logarithms that states log_a (a^n) = n, we can simplify:\n   log_4 64 = log_4 (4^3) = 3\n\n4. Now our expression has been simplified to: 2^3\n\n5. This is a straightforward exponential calculation.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to calculate 2^3. We should instruct the acting agent to use a calculator to compute this value, although it's a simple enough calculation that most people could do it mentally.\n\nAfter this calculation, we'll have our final answer, which we can then verify against the original problem.\n",
