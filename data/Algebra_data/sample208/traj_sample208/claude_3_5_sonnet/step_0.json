    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Plan for Solving the Math Problem:\n\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - The line has a slope of 3/5\n   - The line passes through the point (2002, m)\n   - The y-intercept of the line is 6\n\n2. Recall the point-slope form of a line equation:\n   y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line\n\n3. Use the point-slope form to create an equation:\n   y - m = (3/5)(x - 2002)\n\n4. Convert the equation to slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n   - Expand the right side of the equation\n   - Solve for y\n\n5. Use the fact that the y-intercept is 6:\n   - Set x = 0 and y = 6 in the slope-intercept equation\n   - Solve for m\n\n6. Calculate the value of m:\n   - Use a calculator to perform the final calculation\n   - Round the result to 2 decimal places\n\n7. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of m back into the original equation\n   - Check if it satisfies all given conditions\n\n8. Present the final answer rounded to 2 decimal places\n\nThis plan should lead to the solution within the 10-round limit, focusing on efficient algebraic manipulation and precise calculation.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the planning strategy, let's start by implementing the first few steps to set up our equation:\n\n1. We know the line has a slope of 3/5 and passes through the point (2002, m).\n\n2. Using the point-slope form of a line equation:\n   y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n   We can write: y - m = (3/5)(x - 2002)\n\n3. Let's convert this to slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n   y = (3/5)x - (3/5)(2002) + m\n\n4. Now, we know the y-intercept is 6. This means when x = 0, y = 6.\n   Let's substitute these values:\n   6 = (3/5)(0) - (3/5)(2002) + m\n\n5. Simplify:\n   6 = -(3/5)(2002) + m\n\n6. Solve for m:\n   m = 6 + (3/5)(2002)\n\nThe next step would be to calculate this value of m. We should use a calculator to perform this calculation accurately.\n",
