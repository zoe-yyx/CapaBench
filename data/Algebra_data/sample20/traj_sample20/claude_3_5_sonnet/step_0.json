Identify the composition required:\n   - We need to calculate f(h(-2)), which means we first calculate h(-2) and then use that result as input for f(x).\n\n3. Calculate h(-2):\n   - Replace x with -2 in the function h(x) = x^2 - 1\n   - Calculate (-2)^2 - 1\n\n4. Use the result from step 3 as input for f(x):\n   - Take the result from h(-2) and replace x in f(x) = 5x + 3\n\n5. Perform the final calculation:\n   - Calculate the expression obtained in step 4\n\n6. Verify the result:\n   - Check if the final answer makes sense given the original functions\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 5-6 steps, well within the 10-round limit.\n",
