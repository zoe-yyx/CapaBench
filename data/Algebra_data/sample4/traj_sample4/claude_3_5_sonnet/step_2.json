    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the components:\n   - First complex number: (6 - 2i)\n   - Second complex number: (4 + 3i)\n   - Operation: subtraction\n\n2. Recall the rule for subtracting complex numbers:\n   - When subtracting complex numbers, we subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n   - Pay attention to the signs when subtracting the second complex number.\n\n3. Rearrange the expression:\n   - Rewrite it as (6 - 2i) + (-4 - 3i) to make the subtraction clearer.\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   - Add the real parts: 6 + (-4)\n   - Add the imaginary parts: -2i + (-3i)\n\n5. Simplify:\n   - Perform the addition of real parts\n   - Combine the coefficients of the imaginary parts\n\n6. Write the final result in the standard form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure no errors were made in the simplification process.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current progress and the result from the calculator, we've successfully simplified the real part of our expression. We now know that 6 + (-4) = 2, which will be the real part of our final simplified complex number.\n\nThe next step in our reasoning process is to focus on simplifying the imaginary part of the expression. We need to combine -2i and -3i.\n\nTo do this, we need to add the coefficients of i:\n-2i + (-3i) = (-2 - 3)i = -5i\n\nWe don't need a calculator for this simple addition, but if the acting agent prefers to use one for consistency and accuracy, they can calculate -2 + (-3).\n\nAfter this step, we will have both the real and imaginary parts simplified, allowing us to write the final result in the standard form a + bi.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with combining the imaginary parts, either mentally or using a calculator if preferred.\n",
