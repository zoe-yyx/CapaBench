    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the components:\n   - First complex number: (6 - 2i)\n   - Second complex number: (4 + 3i)\n   - Operation: subtraction\n\n2. Recall the rule for subtracting complex numbers:\n   - When subtracting complex numbers, we subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n   - Pay attention to the signs when subtracting the second complex number.\n\n3. Rearrange the expression:\n   - Rewrite it as (6 - 2i) + (-4 - 3i) to make the subtraction clearer.\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   - Add the real parts: 6 + (-4)\n   - Add the imaginary parts: -2i + (-3i)\n\n5. Simplify:\n   - Perform the addition of real parts\n   - Combine the coefficients of the imaginary parts\n\n6. Write the final result in the standard form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure no errors were made in the simplification process.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by rearranging the expression to make the subtraction clearer. This involves changing the subtraction of (4 + 3i) into addition of its negative.\n\nThe reasoning for this step is:\n1. The original expression is $(6 - 2i) - (4 + 3i)$\n2. Subtracting a complex number is equivalent to adding its negative\n3. The negative of (4 + 3i) is (-4 - 3i)\n4. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as $(6 - 2i) + (-4 - 3i)$\n\nThis rearrangement will make it easier to combine like terms in the next step. The acting agent should write out this rearranged expression.\n",
