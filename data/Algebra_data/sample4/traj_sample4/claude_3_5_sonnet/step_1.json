    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the components:\n   - First complex number: (6 - 2i)\n   - Second complex number: (4 + 3i)\n   - Operation: subtraction\n\n2. Recall the rule for subtracting complex numbers:\n   - When subtracting complex numbers, we subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n   - Pay attention to the signs when subtracting the second complex number.\n\n3. Rearrange the expression:\n   - Rewrite it as (6 - 2i) + (-4 - 3i) to make the subtraction clearer.\n\n4. Combine like terms:\n   - Add the real parts: 6 + (-4)\n   - Add the imaginary parts: -2i + (-3i)\n\n5. Simplify:\n   - Perform the addition of real parts\n   - Combine the coefficients of the imaginary parts\n\n6. Write the final result in the standard form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.\n\n7. Double-check the result to ensure no errors were made in the simplification process.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have rewritten the expression as (6 - 2i) + (-4 - 3i), we can proceed with combining like terms. This involves adding the real parts together and the imaginary parts together separately.\n\nFor the real parts:\nWe need to add 6 and -4.\n\nFor the imaginary parts:\nWe need to add -2i and -3i.\n\nThe next logical step is to perform these additions. This will simplify our expression further and bring us closer to the final result in the standard form a + bi.\n\nThe acting agent should use a calculator to perform these additions:\n1. Calculate 6 + (-4) for the real part\n2. Calculate -2 + (-3) for the coefficient of i in the imaginary part\n\nAfter these calculations, we'll be ready to write our simplified expression.\n",
