    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To find the value of $x$, start by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\\begin{align*} (\\sqrt{5x + 7})^2& =(3)^2\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 5x + 7& =9\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5x& =2\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad x& =\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}.\n\\end{align*}Testing $x = 0.4$ in the original equation shows that it satisfies the equation.",
