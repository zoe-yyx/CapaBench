    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have an equation with a square root on the left side and a constant on the right side.\n   - Our goal is to isolate x.\n\n2. Square both sides of the equation:\n   - This will eliminate the square root.\n   - Remember that (\u221aa)\u00b2 = a\n\n3. Simplify the squared equation:\n   - Expand the left side after squaring.\n\n4. Isolate the variable term:\n   - Move the constant term to the right side of the equation.\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - Divide both sides by the coefficient of x.\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equality.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that solves the equation.\n\nNote: Most steps will involve simple arithmetic that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator. No complex calculations or external information searches should be necessary for this problem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe acting agent has successfully squared both sides of the equation, calculated 3\u00b2 to be 9, and subtracted 7 from both sides of the equation. The current state of the equation should be:\n\n5x = 2\n\nNow, we need to focus on isolating the variable x. According to our planning strategy, the next logical step is to solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 5.\n\nThis operation will isolate x on the left side of the equation and give us our final solution. The acting agent should use a calculator to perform this division accurately, as it may result in a decimal number.\n\nAfter this calculation, we will have successfully solved for x, and the next step would be to verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation.\n",
