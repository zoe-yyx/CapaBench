    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have an equation with a square root on the left side and a constant on the right side.\n   - Our goal is to isolate x.\n\n2. Square both sides of the equation:\n   - This will eliminate the square root.\n   - Remember that (\u221aa)\u00b2 = a\n\n3. Simplify the squared equation:\n   - Expand the left side after squaring.\n\n4. Isolate the variable term:\n   - Move the constant term to the right side of the equation.\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - Divide both sides by the coefficient of x.\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equality.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that solves the equation.\n\nNote: Most steps will involve simple arithmetic that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator. No complex calculations or external information searches should be necessary for this problem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection information and the progress made so far, we need to adjust our approach for presenting the final answer. While we have correctly solved the equation and verified the solution, we should express our answer in a more mathematically precise form. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We have solved the equation and found that x = 0.4, which is correct but not in the best form for an algebraic solution.\n\n2. We should convert this decimal back to a fraction for a more exact representation. The fraction 2/5 is equivalent to 0.4 and is the preferred form for this solution.\n\n3. The acting agent should state the final answer as the fraction 2/5, without including the variable 'x' in the answer statement.\n\n4. No further calculations are needed, but we should emphasize the importance of presenting the solution in its simplest exact form.\n\nThe acting agent should now formulate a clear, concise statement that presents the final answer as a fraction, without repeating the variable name, and mentions that this solution has been verified.\n\nThis approach aligns with best practices in algebraic problem-solving and addresses the improvements suggested in the reflection.\n",
