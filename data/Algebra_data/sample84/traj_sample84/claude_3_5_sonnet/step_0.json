    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the current state of the problem (no actions taken yet), we should start with step 2 of the plan: squaring both sides of the equation. This is a crucial step to eliminate the square root and simplify the equation.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We start with the equation \u221a(5x + 7) = 3\n2. To remove the square root, we need to square both sides of the equation\n3. This operation will transform the equation into a simpler form without the square root\n4. Squaring both sides is a valid algebraic operation that maintains the equality\n\nThe next logical step is to square both sides of the equation. This will set us up for the subsequent steps in our solving process, allowing us to isolate the variable x.\n\nThe acting agent should perform the operation of squaring both sides of the equation \u221a(5x + 7) = 3.\n",
