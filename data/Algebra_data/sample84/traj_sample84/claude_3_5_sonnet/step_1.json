    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have an equation with a square root on the left side and a constant on the right side.\n   - Our goal is to isolate x.\n\n2. Square both sides of the equation:\n   - This will eliminate the square root.\n   - Remember that (\u221aa)\u00b2 = a\n\n3. Simplify the squared equation:\n   - Expand the left side after squaring.\n\n4. Isolate the variable term:\n   - Move the constant term to the right side of the equation.\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - Divide both sides by the coefficient of x.\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equality.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that solves the equation.\n\nNote: Most steps will involve simple arithmetic that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator. No complex calculations or external information searches should be necessary for this problem.\n",
