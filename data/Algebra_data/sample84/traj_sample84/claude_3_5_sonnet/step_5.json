    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have an equation with a square root on the left side and a constant on the right side.\n   - Our goal is to isolate x.\n\n2. Square both sides of the equation:\n   - This will eliminate the square root.\n   - Remember that (\u221aa)\u00b2 = a\n\n3. Simplify the squared equation:\n   - Expand the left side after squaring.\n\n4. Isolate the variable term:\n   - Move the constant term to the right side of the equation.\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - Divide both sides by the coefficient of x.\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equality.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that solves the equation.\n\nNote: Most steps will involve simple arithmetic that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator. No complex calculations or external information searches should be necessary for this problem.\n",

    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The acting agent provided the final answer as a decimal (0.4) instead of keeping it as a fraction (2/5), which is typically preferred for exact solutions in algebra problems.\n\nImprovement: The reasoning and acting agents should prioritize expressing final answers as fractions or in simplest radical form unless explicitly asked for decimal approximations, and avoid repeating variable names in the final answer statement.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights two key issues:\n\n1. Exact vs. Approximate Solutions: In algebraic problems, it's generally preferred to give exact solutions (like fractions or expressions with radicals) rather than decimal approximations. In this case, x = 2/5 would have been a more appropriate final answer than x = 0.4.\n\n2. Answer Format: The acting agent included the variable 'x' in the final answer statement. For many standardized math problems or automated checking systems, the answer should only include the value itself without repeating the variable name.\n\nTo improve in future rounds:\n\n1. The reasoning agent should explicitly state that the final answer should be expressed as a fraction (2/5 in this case) rather than a decimal.\n\n2. The acting agent should be instructed to present only the numerical value as the final answer, without including the variable name.\n\n3. All agents should be more aware of the importance of exact solutions in algebraic problems, preferring fractions and radical expressions over decimal approximations unless specifically requested otherwise.\n\n4. The planning agent could include a step in the initial strategy to \"express the final answer in its simplest exact form (fraction or radical expression) unless a decimal approximation is explicitly requested.\"\n\nThese adjustments should lead to more accurate and acceptable answers in future problem-solving scenarios.",
