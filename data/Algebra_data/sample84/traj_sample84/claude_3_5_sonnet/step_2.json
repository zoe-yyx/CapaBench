Square both sides of the equation:\n   - This will eliminate the square root.\n   - Remember that (\u221aa)\u00b2 = a\n\n3. Simplify the squared equation:\n   - Expand the left side after squaring.\n\n4. Isolate the variable term:\n   - Move the constant term to the right side of the equation.\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   - Divide both sides by the coefficient of x.\n\n6. Verify the solution:\n   - Substitute the found value of x back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equality.\n\n7. Present the final answer:\n   - State the value of x that solves the equation.\n\nNote: Most steps will involve simple arithmetic that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator. No complex calculations or external information searches should be necessary for this problem.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions taken, we have successfully squared both sides of the equation and calculated 3\u00b2 to be 9. Our current equation is:\n\n5x + 7 = 9\n\nNow, we need to focus on isolating the variable term x. To do this, we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x. This operation will move the constant 7 to the right side.\n\n2. After subtracting 7, we'll have a simplified equation with 5x on the left side and a constant on the right side.\n\n3. To solve for x, we'll need to divide both sides of the equation by 5.\n\nThese steps align with our original planning strategy, specifically steps 4 and 5. By following this reasoning, we'll be able to isolate x and solve the equation.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation as the next operation. This can be done using a basic calculator if needed, but it's a simple enough calculation that it might be performed mentally.\n",
