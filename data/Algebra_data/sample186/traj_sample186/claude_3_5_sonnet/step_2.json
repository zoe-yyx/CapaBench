    "reasoning": "\nNow that we have simplified the expression to (6 / \u221a5) + (8 / \u221a7), we need to find a common denominator. As suggested in the planning strategy, the common denominator will be \u221a5\u221a7.\n\nLet's guide the acting agent through this process:\n\n1. Multiply the first term (6 / \u221a5) by (\u221a7 / \u221a7) to get (6\u221a7 / (\u221a5\u221a7)).\n2. Multiply the second term (8 / \u221a7) by (\u221a5 / \u221a5) to get (8\u221a5 / (\u221a5\u221a7)).\n\nNow we can add these fractions:\n\n(6\u221a7 + 8\u221a5) / (\u221a5\u221a7)\n\nThis step aligns with points 2 and 3 of our planning strategy. The next logical step would be to rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \u221a5\u221a7. This will eliminate the radicals in the denominator and bring us closer to expressing the result in the required form.\n\nThe acting agent should perform this algebraic manipulation:\n\n[(6\u221a7 + 8\u221a5) / (\u221a5\u221a7)] * [(\u221a5\u221a7) / (\u221a5\u221a7)]\n\nThis will lead to a rationalized denominator and set us up for identifying p, q, and r in the subsequent steps.\n",
