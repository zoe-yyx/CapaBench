Simplify the expression:\n   - Combine the terms with \u221a5 and the terms with \u221a7 separately\n   - Use the identity (a + 1/a) = (a\u00b2 + 1)/a for each radical\n\n2. Find a common denominator:\n   - The common denominator will likely be \u221a5\u221a7\n\n3. Rationalize the denominator:\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a5\u221a7\n\n4. Simplify the resulting expression:\n   - Combine like terms in the numerator\n   - Simplify the denominator\n\n5. Identify p, q, and r:\n   - p will be the coefficient of \u221a5\n   - q will be the coefficient of \u221a7\n   - r will be the denominator\n\n6. Ensure p, q, and r are positive integers:\n   - If not, multiply both numerator and denominator by appropriate factors\n\n7. Verify that r is as small as possible:\n   - Check if p, q, and r have any common factors\n\n8. Calculate p + q + r\n\n9. Double-check the result:\n   - Substitute the values back into the original equation to verify\n\n10. Present the final answer\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and our current progress, we have successfully simplified the expression, rationalized the denominator, and identified the values of p, q, and r. Let's review our findings:\n\n1. We simplified the original expression to (42\u221a5 + 40\u221a7) / 35\n2. We identified that p = 42, q = 40, and r = 35\n3. We verified that the GCD of 42, 40, and 35 is 1, ensuring r is as small as possible\n4. We calculated p + q + r = 42 + 40 + 35 = 117\n\nThe final step in our planning strategy was to double-check the result by substituting the values back into the original equation. The acting agent has already performed this verification, calculating:\n\n(42\u221a5 + 40\u221a7) / 35 - (\u221a5 + 1/\u221a5 + \u221a7 + 1/\u221a7)\n\nThe result of this calculation was 0, which confirms that our simplified expression (42\u221a5 + 40\u221a7) / 35 is indeed equivalent to the original expression \u221a5 + 1/\u221a5 + \u221a7 + 1/\u221a7.\n\nGiven that all steps in our planning strategy have been completed and verified, we can confidently conclude that the final answer to the problem is 117.\n\nThe next logical step would be for the acting agent to present this final answer and summarize the solution process.\n",
