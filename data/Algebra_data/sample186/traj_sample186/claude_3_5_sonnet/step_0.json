Simplify the expression:\n   - Combine the terms with \u221a5 and the terms with \u221a7 separately\n   - Use the identity (a + 1/a) = (a\u00b2 + 1)/a for each radical\n\n2. Find a common denominator:\n   - The common denominator will likely be \u221a5\u221a7\n\n3. Rationalize the denominator:\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a5\u221a7\n\n4.
