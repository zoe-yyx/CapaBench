    "reasoning": "\nBased on the historical actions and the planning strategy, we have made progress in simplifying the expression. However, the calculator result of 5.70699735707357 is not in the form we need for the final answer. We need to continue with our algebraic manipulation to get the expression in the required form of (p\u221a5 + q\u221a7) / r.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps in our plan:\n\n1. Find a common denominator: Our current expression is (6 / \u221a5) + (8 / \u221a7). The common denominator should be \u221a5\u221a7.\n\n2. After finding the common denominator, we need to rationalize it. This involves multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \u221a5\u221a7.\n\n3. Once we've done that, we'll need to simplify the resulting expression, combining like terms in the numerator.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on these algebraic manipulations:\n\n1. Rewrite the expression with the common denominator \u221a5\u221a7:\n   (6\u221a7 / (\u221a5\u221a7)) + (8\u221a5 / (\u221a5\u221a7))\n\n2. Combine these fractions:\n   (6\u221a7 + 8\u221a5) / (\u221a5\u221a7)\n\n3. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by \u221a5\u221a7:\n   ((6\u221a7 + 8\u221a5) * (\u221a5\u221a7)) / ((\u221a5\u221a7) * (\u221a5\u221a7))\n\n4. Simplify the denominator: (\u221a5\u221a7) * (\u221a5\u221a7) = 5 * 7 = 35\n\n5. Expand the numerator: (6\u221a7 + 8\u221a5) * (\u221a5\u221a7) = 6*5 + 6\u221a35 + 8\u221a35 + 8*7 = 30 + 14\u221a35 + 56 = 86 + 14\u221a35\n\nTherefore, the expression should now be in the form: (86 + 14\u221a35) / 35\n\nThe acting agent should perform these algebraic steps to reach this form.\n",
