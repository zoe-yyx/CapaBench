    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy, we should start by breaking down the nested function and calculating each step one by one. Let's begin with the innermost function and work our way outwards.\n\n1. First, we need to calculate p(4):\n   p(x) = x - 2\n   p(4) = 4 - 2 = 2\n\n2. Next, we calculate q(p(4)):\n   q(x) = 3x + 1\n   q(p(4)) = q(2) = 3(2) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3. Now we need to find p^(-1)(q(p(4))):\n   p^(-1) is the inverse function of p(x) = x - 2\n   To find p^(-1)(x), we solve y = x - 2 for x:\n   x = y + 2\n   So, p^(-1)(x) = x + 2\n   p^(-1)(q(p(4))) = p^(-1)(7) = 7 + 2 = 9\n\n4. Next, we need to find q^(-1)(p^(-1)(q(p(4)))):\n   q^(-1) is the inverse function of q(x) = 3x + 1\n   To find q^(-1)(x), we solve y = 3x + 1 for x:\n   x = (y - 1) / 3\n   So, q^(-1)(x) = (x - 1) / 3\n   q^(-1)(p^(-1)(q(p(4)))) = q^(-1)(9) = (9 - 1) / 3 = 8 / 3\n\n5. Finally, we calculate p(q^(-1)(p^(-1)(q(p(4))))):\n   p(x) = x - 2\n   p(8/3) = 8/3 - 2 = 8/3 - 6/3 = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to use a calculator to verify these calculations, especially the final step involving fractions.\n",
