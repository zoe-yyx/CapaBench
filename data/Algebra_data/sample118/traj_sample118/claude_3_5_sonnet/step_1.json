Break down the nested function into steps:\n   a) Calculate p(4)\n   b) Calculate q(p(4))\n   c) Find p^(-1)(q(p(4)))\n   d) Find q^(-1)(p^(-1)(q(p(4))))\n   e) Finally, calculate p(q^(-1)(p^(-1)(q(p(4)))))\n\n3. For each step:\n   - Substitute the values\n   - Simplify expressions\n   - Solve equations when necessary\n\n4. Pay special attention to inverse functions:\n   - For p^(-1)(x), solve y = x - 2 for x\n   - For q^(-1)(x), solve y = 3x + 1 for x\n\n5. Use a calculator for any complex arithmetic\n\n6. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy\n\n7. Provide the final answer as a single numerical value\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the previous calculations and the result from the calculator, we can now confirm and finalize our solution. Let's summarize the steps and the final result:\n\n1. We calculated p(4) = 2\n2. Then q(p(4)) = q(2) = 7\n3. Next, p^(-1)(7) = 9\n4. Then q^(-1)(9) = 8/3\n5. Finally, p(8/3) = 8/3 - 2 = 2/3\n\nThe calculator confirmed that 8/3 - 2 \u2248 0.666666666666667, which is indeed equal to 2/3.\n\nTherefore, we have successfully solved the problem. The value of p(q^(-1)(p^(-1)(q(p(4))))) is 2/3.\n\nTo ensure completeness, we should express this result both as a fraction (2/3) and as a decimal (approximately 0.6666667). This dual representation can be helpful for clarity and for potential future calculations.\n\nThe next step should be to formally present this final answer, including both the fraction and decimal representations, and to verify that we have fully addressed the original problem statement.\n",
