    "observation": "Given two polynomials $f(x) = x^4 - 5x^3 + 6x - 2$ and $g(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 5$, find the leading coefficient of their product.",
    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We have two polynomials: f(x) and g(x)\n   - We need to find the product of these polynomials\n   - We only need the leading coefficient of the resulting product\n\n2. Identify the degrees of the polynomials:\n   - f(x) is of degree 4\n   - g(x) is of degree 3\n\n3. Determine the degree of the product:\n   - The degree of the product will be the sum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x)\n   - Degree of product = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n4. Focus on the terms that will contribute to the leading term:\n   - The leading term of f(x) is x^4\n   - The leading term of g(x) is 2x^3\n\n5. Multiply the leading terms:\n   - (x^4) * (2x^3) = 2x^7\n\n6. Identify the leading coefficient:\n   - The leading coefficient is the coefficient of x^7, which is 2\n\n7. Verify the result:\n   - Confirm that no other terms in the multiplication could contribute to x^7\n\n8. Present the final answer:\n   - The leading coefficient of the product polynomial is 2\n\nThis plan focuses on efficiently finding the leading coefficient without performing the entire polynomial multiplication, saving time and reducing the chance of errors.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the nature of the problem, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We don't need to perform the entire polynomial multiplication to find the leading coefficient of the product. This is because the leading coefficient of the product will only come from multiplying the leading terms of f(x) and g(x).\n\n2. The leading term of f(x) is x^4, with a coefficient of 1.\n   The leading term of g(x) is 2x^3.\n\n3. When we multiply these leading terms, we get:\n   x^4 * 2x^3 = 2x^7\n\n4. This will be the leading term of the product polynomial, as no other combination of terms from f(x) and g(x) can produce a term with a higher degree than 7.\n\n5. The coefficient of this leading term, 2x^7, is 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the leading coefficient of the product of f(x) and g(x) is 2. No further calculations or operations are necessary to solve this problem.\n",
