    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the polynomials:\n   - First polynomial: 2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5\n   - Second polynomial: x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1\n\n2. Prepare for subtraction:\n   - Recall that subtracting a polynomial is the same as adding its negative\n   - Change the signs of all terms in the second polynomial\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   - Align terms with the same degree (x^3, x^2, x, and constant terms)\n   - Add the coefficients of like terms\n\n4. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Combine all terms\n   - Ensure the polynomial is in standard form (descending order of exponents)\n\n5. Check the result:\n   - Verify that no like terms remain uncombined\n   - Confirm that the final polynomial is properly formatted\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the resulting polynomial in its simplest form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 rounds of action, requiring minimal calculations that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the first historical action, we have set up the problem for subtraction by changing the signs of the second polynomial. The next logical step is to actually perform this operation and combine like terms. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We need to rewrite the entire expression with the changed signs for the second polynomial.\n2. Then, we should align terms with the same degree (x^3, x^2, x, and constant terms).\n3. After alignment, we can add the coefficients of like terms.\n\nThis process will allow us to simplify the expression and move towards our final answer. The acting agent should write out the expression with changed signs and then combine like terms, which may require some basic calculations for the coefficients.\n",
