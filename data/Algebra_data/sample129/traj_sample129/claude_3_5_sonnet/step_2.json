Prepare for subtraction:\n   - Recall that subtracting a polynomial is the same as adding its negative\n   - Change the signs of all terms in the second polynomial\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   - Align terms with the same degree (x^3, x^2, x, and constant terms)\n   - Add the coefficients of like terms\n\n4. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Combine all terms\n   - Ensure the polynomial is in standard form (descending order of exponents)\n\n5. Check the result:\n   - Verify that no like terms remain uncombined\n   - Confirm that the final polynomial is properly formatted\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the resulting polynomial in its simplest form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 rounds of action, requiring minimal calculations that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the historical actions taken, we are now at the stage of combining like terms and simplifying the resulting polynomial.

Review the combined expression to ensure all like terms have been properly identified and grouped.\n2. Add the coefficients of like terms to simplify the polynomial further.\n3. Arrange the resulting terms in descending order of exponents (standard form).\n\nThis step will complete the simplification process and lead us to the final answer. The acting agent should focus on performing these calculations carefully, paying attention to the signs of each term and ensuring no terms are overlooked in the process.\n\nAfter this step, we should have a simplified polynomial that represents the difference between the two original polynomials.
