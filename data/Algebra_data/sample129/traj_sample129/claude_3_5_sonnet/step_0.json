    "planning_context": "\n1. Identify the polynomials:\n   - First polynomial: 2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5\n   - Second polynomial: x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1\n\n2. Prepare for subtraction:\n   - Recall that subtracting a polynomial is the same as adding its negative\n   - Change the signs of all terms in the second polynomial\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   - Align terms with the same degree (x^3, x^2, x, and constant terms)\n   - Add the coefficients of like terms\n\n4. Simplify the resulting polynomial:\n   - Combine all terms\n   - Ensure the polynomial is in standard form (descending order of exponents)\n\n5. Check the result:\n   - Verify that no like terms remain uncombined\n   - Confirm that the final polynomial is properly formatted\n\n6. Present the final answer:\n   - Write the resulting polynomial in its simplest form\n\nThis plan should lead to the correct solution within 2-3 rounds of action, requiring minimal calculations that can be done mentally or with a basic calculator.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy and the nature of the problem, we should start by focusing on the first two steps of the plan. Our reasoning for the next action is as follows:\n\n1. We have two polynomials that need to be subtracted:\n   (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5) - (x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1)\n\n2. To perform this subtraction, we need to change the signs of all terms in the second polynomial. This is equivalent to adding the negative of the second polynomial to the first.\n\n3. After changing the signs, we can rewrite the expression as:\n   (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x - 5) + (-x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\n4. Now we have prepared the polynomials for combination. The next step will be to align like terms and add their coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on rewriting the expression with the signs of the second polynomial changed, preparing it for the combination of like terms in the next step.\n",
