Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem aims to prove that P ∧ P ↔ P for any proposition P.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (↔), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Break down the proof into two parts:\n   a. Forward direction: P ∧ P → P\n   b. Backward direction: P → P ∧ P\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (P ∧ P → P):\n   - Use the and.left or and.right tactic to extract P from P ∧ P.\n   - This should be straightforward as P is directly available in the hypothesis.\n\n4. Prove the backward direction (P → P ∧ P):\n   - Given P, we need to construct P ∧ P.\n   - Use the and.intro tactic to create the conjunction.\n   - Both parts of the conjunction will be the same P from the hypothesis.\n\n5. Combine the two directions:\n   - Use the iff.intro tactic to combine the forward and backward proofs.\n\n6. Consider using the following tactics:\n   - intro\n   - apply\n   - exact\n   - constructor\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure that all parts of the theorem are addressed.\n   - Check that the proof is concise and clear.\n   - Verify that no unnecessary steps are included.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem andDup in Lean 4, breaking it down into manageable steps and suggesting relevant tactics to use.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for theorem andDup, our first step should be to set up the structure for proving a bidirectional implication (↔). The planning strategy suggests using the iff.intro tactic to combine the forward and backward proofs.\n\nHowever, in Lean 4, it's often more idiomatic to use the constructor tactic for ↔ proofs. This tactic will automatically set up both directions of the proof for us.\n\nAfter using the constructor tactic, we'll have two goals to prove:\n1. P ∧ P → P (the forward direction)\n2. P → P ∧ P (the backward direction)\n\nFor the first goal (P ∧ P → P), we should introduce the hypothesis and then use the and.left tactic to extract the left part of the conjunction, which will directly prove P.\n\nFor the second goal (P → P ∧ P), we should introduce the hypothesis P and then use the and.intro tactic to construct the conjunction P ∧ P using the same P twice.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the acting agent to start with the constructor tactic to set up the proof structure, and then proceed with proving each direction separately.\n",
