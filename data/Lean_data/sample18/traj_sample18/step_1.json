    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for shift_left1_func_plus:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1\n   - Note that func_plus combines two functions by adding their outputs\n   - shift_left1 shifts the input of a function by 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'funext' tactic to work with function equality\n   - This will introduce a variable, say 'x', representing an arbitrary integer input\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the left-hand side: shift_left1 (func_plus f g)\n   - Expand the right-hand side: func_plus (shift_left1 f) (shift_left1 g)\n\n4. Simplify expressions:\n   - Simplify the left-hand side using the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus\n   - Simplify the right-hand side using the same definitions\n\n5. Show equality:\n   - After simplification, both sides should have the form: f (x + 1) + g (x + 1)\n   - Use 'rfl' tactic to prove equality if the expressions are identical\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - If needed, use 'simp' or other simplification tactics to handle any remaining complexities\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n\nThis plan focuses on methodically expanding definitions and simplifying expressions to show that both sides of the equation are equivalent for all integer inputs.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof attempt was very close to being correct. The 'funext' and 'simp' tactics were applied correctly and did most of the work. The error occurred because the 'rfl' tactic was unnecessary after 'simp' had fully solved the goal.\n\nTo complete the proof successfully:\n\n1. Keep the 'funext x' tactic, which correctly introduces an arbitrary integer input 'x'.\n2. Retain the 'simp [shift_left1, func_plus]' tactic, which expands the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'func_plus', and then simplifies the expressions on both sides of the equation. This tactic is powerful enough to solve the entire goal in this case.\n3. Remove the 'rfl' tactic as it's not needed and causes an error when there are no goals left to solve.\n4. Optionally, add a 'done' tactic at the end to explicitly indicate that the proof is complete. This is not strictly necessary but can be a good practice for clarity.\n\nThe next action should be to modify the proof script by removing the 'rfl' tactic and optionally adding 'done' at the end. This adjustment should result in a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
