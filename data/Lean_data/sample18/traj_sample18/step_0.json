    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for shift_left1_func_plus:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of func_plus and shift_left1\n   - Note that func_plus combines two functions by adding their outputs\n   - shift_left1 shifts the input of a function by 1\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with 'funext' tactic to work with function equality\n   - This will introduce a variable, say 'x', representing an arbitrary integer input\n\n3. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the left-hand side: shift_left1 (func_plus f g)\n   - Expand the right-hand side: func_plus (shift_left1 f) (shift_left1 g)\n\n4. Simplify expressions:\n   - Simplify the left-hand side using the definitions of shift_left1 and func_plus\n   - Simplify the right-hand side using the same definitions\n\n5. Show equality:\n   - After simplification, both sides should have the form: f (x + 1) + g (x + 1)\n   - Use 'rfl' tactic to prove equality if the expressions are identical\n\n6. Finalize:\n   - If needed, use 'simp' or other simplification tactics to handle any remaining complexities\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n\nThis plan focuses on methodically expanding definitions and simplifying expressions to show that both sides of the equation are equivalent for all integer inputs.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the theorem statement and the definitions provided, our first step should be to set up the proof using function extensionality. This is because we're dealing with an equality between two functions, and we need to show that they produce the same output for all possible inputs.\n\nThe reasoning for the next steps is as follows:\n\n1. Use the 'funext' tactic to introduce an arbitrary input 'x'. This will allow us to prove that the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation are equal for any given input.\n\n2. After introducing 'x', we should focus on expanding the definitions on both sides of the equation. This will involve:\n   a) Expanding the definition of 'shift_left1' on the left-hand side\n   b) Expanding the definition of 'func_plus' inside the 'shift_left1' on the left-hand side\n   c) Expanding the definition of 'func_plus' on the right-hand side\n   d) Expanding the definition of 'shift_left1' for both 'f' and 'g' on the right-hand side\n\n3. Once the definitions are expanded, we should see that both sides of the equation reduce to the same expression: f (x + 1) + g (x + 1)\n\n4. If the expressions are identical after expansion, we can use the 'rfl' tactic to prove their equality.\n\nThis reasoning follows the plan by setting up the proof structure, expanding definitions, and preparing to show the equality of the resulting expressions.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because after applying 'simp', the goal was completely solved, leaving no goals for 'rfl' to address.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'rfl' tactic as it's unnecessary after 'simp' has fully solved the goal, and consider adding a final 'done' tactic to explicitly indicate the proof is complete.\n```\n\nThe proof attempt was very close to being correct. The 'funext' and 'simp' tactics were applied correctly and did most of the work. However, the 'rfl' tactic at the end was superfluous and caused an error because there were no more goals to solve after 'simp'.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. Keep the 'funext x' tactic to introduce the arbitrary input.\n2. Retain the 'simp [shift_left1, func_plus]' tactic, which expands the definitions and solves the goal.\n3. Remove the 'rfl' tactic as it's not needed.\n4. Optionally, add a 'done' tactic at the end to explicitly indicate that the proof is complete.\n\nThis adjustment should result in a successful proof of the theorem. The reasoning and action steps were largely correct, but the final step needed this small modification. In future proofs, it's important to pay attention to whether tactics like 'simp' fully solve the goal, eliminating the need for additional tactics like 'rfl'.",
