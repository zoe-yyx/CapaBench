    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an iff (↔) statement\n   - The left side is ¬ (P → Q)\n   - The right side is P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n2. Plan to prove both directions of the iff:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical logic (since we've opened Classical) to prove P\n   - Use the assumption to prove ¬ Q\n   - Combine these to form P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Show that this contradicts P → Q\n   - Conclude ¬ (P → Q)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce assumptions\n   - apply: to apply logical rules or previous theorems\n   - constructor: to prove conjunctions\n   - by_contradiction: for proof by contradiction\n   - cases: to destruct conjunctions or disjunctions\n   - exact: to provide direct proofs\n   - simp: to simplify expressions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling double negations\n   - Correctly applying classical logic principles\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Combine both directions to complete the iff proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. For the mp direction (¬(P → Q) → P ∧ ¬Q):\n   - Start with 'by_contra' to assume ¬(P ∧ ¬Q) and aim for a contradiction.\n   - Use classical reasoning to show that ¬(P ∧ ¬Q) implies (P → Q).\n   - This will directly contradict the assumption h : ¬(P → Q), completing this direction.\n\n2. For the mpr direction (P ∧ ¬Q → ¬(P → Q)):\n   - The current approach looks correct. We should keep this part as is.\n   - Introduce the assumption P ∧ ¬Q.\n   - Then, introduce the assumption (P → Q) and derive a contradiction.\n   - This will prove ¬(P → Q), completing the backward direction.\n\n3. General structure:\n   - Use proper indentation and the '·' symbol for nested tactics to improve readability.\n   - Ensure each direction of the iff is clearly separated and structured.\n\n4. Specific tactics to use:\n   - 'by_contra' for the contradiction proof in the mp direction.\n   - 'cases' to destruct the P ∧ ¬Q assumption in the mpr direction.\n   - 'apply' to use the assumptions effectively.\n   - 'exact' to provide direct proofs when possible.\n\nBy following this reasoning, the acting agent should be able to construct a correct and complete proof for the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete, with errors in both the mp and mpr directions, particularly in the mp direction where the 'by_contra' tactic is unrecognized.\n\nImprovement: Restructure the mp direction using classical reasoning without 'by_contra', and ensure the mpr direction is properly completed with explicit steps to derive the contradiction.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. For the mp direction (¬(P → Q) → P ∧ ¬Q):\n   - Instead of using 'by_contra', we should use classical reasoning to prove P and ¬Q separately.\n   - For P, we can use the law of excluded middle (P ∨ ¬P) and show that ¬P leads to a contradiction.\n   - For ¬Q, we can directly assume Q and show it contradicts with ¬(P → Q).\n\n2. For the mpr direction (P ∧ ¬Q → ¬(P → Q)):\n   - The current approach is correct, but it needs to be completed.\n   - After applying the contradiction to hnq, we should explicitly state that this proves ¬(P → Q).\n\n3. General improvements:\n   - Use more explicit naming for hypotheses to improve readability.\n   - Add comments to explain the reasoning behind each major step.\n\n4. Specific tactics to use:\n   - 'apply Classical.byCases' for the law of excluded middle in the mp direction.\n   - 'contradiction' tactic where appropriate to derive contradictions more succinctly.\n   - 'exact' to provide direct proofs when possible.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, the acting agent should be able to construct a correct and complete proof for the theorem without using 'sorry' or encountering errors.",
