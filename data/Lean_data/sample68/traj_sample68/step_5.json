Plan to prove both directions of the iff:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical logic (since we've opened Classical) to prove P\n   - Use the assumption to prove ¬ Q\n   - Combine these to form P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Show that this contradicts P → Q\n   - Conclude ¬ (P → Q)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce assumptions\n   - apply: to apply logical rules or previous theorems\n   - constructor: to prove conjunctions\n   - by_contradiction: for proof by contradiction\n   - cases: to destruct conjunctions or disjunctions\n   - exact: to provide direct proofs\n   - simp: to simplify expressions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling double negations\n   - Correctly applying classical logic principles\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Combine both directions to complete the iff proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. For the mp direction:\n   - Keep the 'constructor' tactic to split the conjunction.\n   - For the left conjunct (P):\n     * Use 'by_contra np' to start a proof by contradiction.\n     * Apply 'push_neg at h' to simplify the negation.\n     * Use 'cases h with p hpq' to extract the witness from the resulting existential statement.\n     * Use 'exact p' to prove P.\n   - For the right conjunct (¬Q):\n     * Use 'by_contra nq' to start another proof by contradiction.\n     * Apply 'absurd (h (λ hp => nq))' to derive a contradiction.\n     * This uses the fact that if Q were true, P → Q would hold, contradicting our assumption h.\n\n2. For the mpr direction:\n   - The current structure looks correct. Maintain it as is:\n     * Use 'intro h' to introduce the assumption.\n     * Use 'intro hpq' to introduce the implication we want to negate.\n     * Use 'cases h with hp hnq' to deconstruct the conjunction.\n     * Apply 'hnq' to the result of 'hpq hp' to derive the final contradiction.\n\n3. Ensure proper indentation and use of '·' for nested tactics to improve readability.\n\n4. Double-check that all goals are solved after these steps.\n\nThis approach should provide a complete and correct proof for both directions of the iff statement.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy for the mp direction is incorrect, particularly in handling the negation of the implication and deriving P and ¬Q separately.\n\nImprovement: Revise the mp direction by using 'by_contra' for the entire conjunction, then derive a contradiction using the assumption ¬(P → Q) and the principles of classical logic.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt has several issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. In the mp direction, the approach to prove P and ¬Q separately is not effective. The negation of an implication (¬(P → Q)) is equivalent to (P ∧ ¬Q), so we should leverage this fact.\n\n2. The use of 'by_contra' for each part of the conjunction is unnecessary and complicates the proof.\n\n3. The proof for ¬Q in the mp direction is incorrect. It attempts to use 'h' (which is ¬(P → Q)) directly with 'q', which doesn't follow logically.\n\n4. The mpr direction looks structurally correct, but it wasn't reached due to errors in the mp direction.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. For the mp direction, use 'by_contra' once for the entire conjunction (P ∧ ¬Q).\n\n2. Inside this contradiction proof, assume ¬(P ∧ ¬Q) and derive a contradiction with the given h : ¬(P → Q).\n\n3. Use classical reasoning to show that ¬(P ∧ ¬Q) implies (P → Q), which directly contradicts h.\n\n4. Keep the mpr direction as is, as it appears to be on the right track.\n\n5. Ensure proper indentation and use of '·' for nested tactics to improve readability.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to complete the proof successfully in the next iteration.",
