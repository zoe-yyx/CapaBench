    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the plan to prove both directions of the iff statement. The first step is to set up the structure for the bidirectional proof.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to prove an iff statement, so we should use the `constructor` tactic to split the proof into two parts: the forward direction (→) and the backward direction (←).\n\n2. For the forward direction (→):\n   - We should introduce the assumption ¬(P → Q) using the `intro` tactic.\n   - Then, we'll need to prove P ∧ ¬Q, which is a conjunction. We can use `constructor` again to split this into two subgoals: proving P and proving ¬Q.\n   - To prove P, we can use classical logic with `by_contradiction`, as direct proof might be challenging.\n   - For ¬Q, we can also use `by_contradiction` if a direct proof is not immediately apparent.\n\n3. For the backward direction (←):\n   - We should introduce the assumption P ∧ ¬Q using the `intro` tactic.\n   - Then, we need to prove ¬(P → Q), which can be done using `by_contradiction`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I suggest starting with the `constructor` tactic to set up the bidirectional proof structure. This will give us a clear framework to work with for both directions of the iff statement.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt used incorrect syntax for the `by_contradiction` tactic, leading to an \"unknown tactic\" error and leaving goals unsolved.\n\nImprovement: Correct the syntax of the `by_contradiction` tactic by using parentheses instead of a line break, and ensure that each subgoal is properly addressed with valid Lean 4 tactics.\n```\n\nBased on the current observation, there are several issues in the proof attempt that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The main error stems from the incorrect syntax used for the `by_contradiction` tactic. In Lean 4, `by_contradiction` should be followed by parentheses containing the contradiction assumption, not a line break.\n\n2. Some subgoals were left unsolved, indicating that the proof steps were incomplete or incorrect.\n\n3. The proof structure is generally correct, using `constructor` to split the iff statement and then addressing each direction. However, the implementation of the proof steps needs refinement.\n\nTo improve the proof attempt:\n\n1. Correct the syntax of `by_contradiction`. For example, change:\n   ```lean\n   · by_contradiction np\n     ...\n   ```\n   to:\n   ```lean\n   · by_contradiction (np)\n     ...\n   ```\n\n2. Ensure that each subgoal is properly addressed. After using `by_contradiction`, make sure to use the contradiction assumption to derive a contradiction and complete the proof of that subgoal.\n\n3. For the mpr (←) direction, the current approach looks correct, but make sure to complete the proof by deriving a contradiction from the assumptions.\n\n4. Double-check that all tactics used are valid in Lean 4, as there might be slight differences from Lean 3.\n\n5. Consider using more descriptive names for hypotheses to improve readability and reduce confusion.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, the proof attempt should be more likely to succeed in the next iteration.",
