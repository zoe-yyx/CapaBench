Plan to prove both directions of the iff:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical logic (since we've opened Classical) to prove P\n   - Use the assumption to prove ¬ Q\n   - Combine these to form P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Show that this contradicts P → Q\n   - Conclude ¬ (P → Q)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce assumptions\n   - apply: to apply logical rules or previous theorems\n   - constructor: to prove conjunctions\n   - by_contradiction: for proof by contradiction\n   - cases: to destruct conjunctions or disjunctions\n   - exact: to provide direct proofs\n   - simp: to simplify expressions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling double negations\n   - Correctly applying classical logic principles\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Combine both directions to complete the iff proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. For the mp (→) direction:\n   - The structure using 'constructor' is correct.\n   - For the left conjunct (P):\n     * Use 'by_contra np' correctly to start a proof by contradiction.\n     * Apply the assumption 'h' to derive a contradiction.\n   - For the right conjunct (¬Q):\n     * Use 'intro q' to assume Q.\n     * Apply 'h' to the implication P → Q to derive a contradiction.\n\n2. For the mpr (←) direction:\n   - The current structure is correct, but we can improve clarity.\n   - Use 'intro h' to introduce the assumption P ∧ ¬Q.\n   - Use 'intro hpq' to assume P → Q.\n   - Use 'cases h with | intro hp hnq =>' to destructure the conjunction.\n   - Apply 'hnq' to '(hpq hp)' to derive the contradiction.\n\n3. Throughout the proof:\n   - Ensure proper indentation and use of '·' for nested tactics.\n   - Use 'have' statements for intermediate steps to improve readability.\n\n4. General approach:\n   - Start with the overall structure using 'constructor' for the iff proof.\n   - For each direction, introduce assumptions, then prove the goal step by step.\n   - Use classical logic principles where necessary, especially for the left-to-right direction.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof contains logical errors and incorrect use of tactics, particularly in the left-to-right (mp) direction of the iff proof.\n\nImprovement: Restructure the mp direction by using 'by_contra' for both P and ¬Q, and utilize the 'absurd' tactic to derive contradictions more effectively.\n```\n\nReflection:\n\n1. The main issue lies in the mp direction of the proof. The approach for proving P and ¬Q is not correct, leading to unsolved goals.\n\n2. In the left conjunct (P) of the mp direction, the use of 'by_contra' is correct, but the subsequent steps do not effectively derive a contradiction.\n\n3. In the right conjunct (¬Q) of the mp direction, the proof structure is incorrect. We should use 'by_contra' here as well, instead of directly introducing q.\n\n4. The mpr direction seems structurally correct, but it wasn't reached due to errors in the mp direction.\n\n5. There's no use of 'sorry' in the proof, which is good. We need to maintain this rigorous approach.\n\nFor the next steps:\n\n1. In the mp direction, use 'by_contra' for both P and ¬Q.\n\n2. For proving P, after 'by_contra np', use 'push_neg' at h to get 'h : ∃ x, P ∧ ¬Q', then use 'cases' to extract the witness.\n\n3. For proving ¬Q, use 'by_contra nq', then use 'absurd' to derive a contradiction using the assumption h and the implication P → Q.\n\n4. Maintain the current structure for the mpr direction, as it appears to be on the right track.\n\n5. Ensure proper indentation and use of '·' for nested tactics to improve readability.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we should be able to complete the proof successfully in the next iteration.",
