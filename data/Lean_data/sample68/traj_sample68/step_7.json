Plan to prove both directions of the iff:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical logic (since we've opened Classical) to prove P\n   - Use the assumption to prove ¬ Q\n   - Combine these to form P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Show that this contradicts P → Q\n   - Conclude ¬ (P → Q)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce assumptions\n   - apply: to apply logical rules or previous theorems\n   - constructor: to prove conjunctions\n   - by_contradiction: for proof by contradiction\n   - cases: to destruct conjunctions or disjunctions\n   - exact: to provide direct proofs\n   - simp: to simplify expressions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling double negations\n   - Correctly applying classical logic principles\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Combine both directions to complete the iff proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. For the mp direction (¬(P → Q) → P ∧ ¬Q):\n   - We need to prove both P and ¬Q separately.\n   - For P:\n     a. Apply the law of excluded middle using 'apply Classical.byCases P'\n     b. For the case where P is true, it's trivial\n     c. For the case where P is false, show that it leads to a contradiction with the assumption ¬(P → Q)\n   - For ¬Q:\n     a. Use 'intro' to assume Q\n     b. Show that this assumption leads to a contradiction with ¬(P → Q)\n\n2. For the mpr direction (P ∧ ¬Q → ¬(P → Q)):\n   - The current approach is correct, but needs to be completed\n   - After applying the contradiction to hnq, explicitly state that this proves ¬(P → Q)\n\n3. Use more descriptive names for hypotheses, such as 'h_not_imply' instead of just 'h'\n\n4. Add comments to explain the reasoning behind each major step\n\nNext, let's focus on completing the mp direction, as it's currently incomplete. Here's a step-by-step guide for the acting agent:\n\n1. Replace the current 'constructor' and subsequent lines in the mp direction with:\n   constructor\n   · apply Classical.byCases P\n     · intro h_p\n       exact h_p\n     · intro h_not_p\n       -- Prove by contradiction\n       have h_contra : P → Q := by\n         intro h_p\n         contradiction\n       contradiction\n   · intro h_q\n     apply h\n     intro h_p\n     exact h_q\n\nThis structure should correctly prove both P and ¬Q, completing the mp direction of the proof.\n",
