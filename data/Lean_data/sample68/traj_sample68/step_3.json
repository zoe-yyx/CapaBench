Plan to prove both directions of the iff:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical logic (since we've opened Classical) to prove P\n   - Use the assumption to prove ¬ Q\n   - Combine these to form P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Show that this contradicts P → Q\n   - Conclude ¬ (P → Q)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce assumptions\n   - apply: to apply logical rules or previous theorems\n   - constructor: to prove conjunctions\n   - by_contradiction: for proof by contradiction\n   - cases: to destruct conjunctions or disjunctions\n   - exact: to provide direct proofs\n   - simp: to simplify expressions\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Handling double negations\n   - Correctly applying classical logic principles\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Combine both directions to complete the iff proof\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. The overall structure of the proof is correct, using 'constructor' to split the iff statement into two implications. We should maintain this structure.\n\n2. For the forward direction (mp case):\n   a. We need to prove P and ¬Q separately after the 'constructor' tactic.\n   b. To prove P, we should use 'by_contra' instead of 'byContradiction'.\n   c. For ¬Q, we can directly use 'intro' and 'apply' tactics.\n\n3. For the backward direction (mpr case):\n   The approach is correct, but we need to ensure proper use of 'intro' and 'apply' tactics.\n\n4. Specific guidance for the acting agent:\n   a. In the mp.left case, use 'by_contra' to prove P by contradiction.\n   b. In the mp.right case, use 'intro' to assume Q, then 'apply h' to reach a contradiction.\n   c. In the mpr case, use 'intro' to assume P ∧ ¬Q, then 'intro' again for P → Q, and finally use 'apply' and 'exact' to reach the contradiction.\n\n5. Remember to use proper Lean 4 syntax, including correct indentation and use of dots (·) for nested tactics.\n\n6. After each major step, consider using 'show' statements to clarify the current goal, especially in more complex reasoning steps.\n\nBy following this reasoning, the acting agent should be able to construct a valid Lean 4 proof for the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails due to incorrect use of Lean 4 syntax, particularly in the 'by_contra' tactic and the structure of nested tactics.\n\nImprovement: Restructure the proof using correct Lean 4 syntax, including proper indentation, use of 'have' statements for intermediate steps, and correct application of the 'by_contra' tactic.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt shows a good understanding of the logical structure needed to prove the theorem. However, it falters in the implementation due to syntax errors and improper use of Lean 4 tactics. Here are some specific points for improvement:\n\n1. The 'by_contra' tactic is causing an error. In Lean 4, we should use 'by_contra' followed by an identifier for the contradiction hypothesis, e.g., 'by_contra np'.\n\n2. The nested structure of tactics is not properly implemented. In Lean 4, we should use indentation and '·' for nested tactics.\n\n3. The proof of the right-hand side of the conjunction (¬Q) in the mp case is incomplete. We need to derive a contradiction using the assumption h.\n\n4. In the mpr case, the proof structure is correct, but we need to ensure proper use of 'intro' and 'apply' tactics.\n\n5. Consider using 'have' statements to break down complex steps and improve readability.\n\nFor the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing these improvements:\n\n1. Correctly use 'by_contra' in the mp.left case.\n2. Complete the proof for ¬Q in the mp.right case by deriving a contradiction.\n3. Use proper indentation and '·' for nested tactics throughout the proof.\n4. In the mpr case, use 'have' statements to clearly show the logical steps.\n\nBy addressing these issues, we should be able to construct a valid Lean 4 proof for the theorem in the next attempt.",
