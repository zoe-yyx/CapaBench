For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical logic (since we've opened Classical) to prove P\n   - Use the assumption to prove ¬ Q\n   - Combine these to form P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Show that this contradicts P → Q\n   - Conclude ¬ (P → Q)\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\n1. For the mp (→) direction:\n   a. We need to prove P and ¬Q separately after introducing the assumption ¬(P → Q).\n   b. For proving P:\n      - Use `by_contradiction (np)` to assume ¬P.\n      - Apply the assumption h : ¬(P → Q) to derive a contradiction.\n      - Show that assuming ¬P leads to P → Q, which contradicts h.\n   c. For proving ¬Q:\n      - Use `by_contradiction (q)` to assume Q.\n      - Apply the assumption h : ¬(P → Q) to derive a contradiction.\n      - Show that assuming Q leads to P → Q, which contradicts h.\n\n2. For the mpr (←) direction:\n   - The current approach is correct.\n   - After introducing the assumption P ∧ ¬Q and the hypothesis P → Q, use `cases` to split the conjunction.\n   - Apply the implication to P to derive Q, which contradicts ¬Q.\n\n3. General improvements:\n   - Ensure all tactic applications are followed by a comma or period to separate them.\n   - Use more descriptive names for hypotheses, e.g., `h_not_impl` instead of `h`.\n   - Consider using `exact` or `apply` tactics to provide explicit proof terms where possible.\n\n4. If any step is still unclear, consider breaking it down further using intermediate `have` statements to make the proof more explicit and easier to follow.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempts to use Lean 3 tactics in a Lean 4 environment, leading to errors and unsolved goals.\n\nImprovement: Adapt the proof to use Lean 4 syntax and tactics, particularly focusing on the correct application of `by_contradiction` and handling of implications.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is that the proof is written using Lean 3 syntax and tactics, but we're working in a Lean 4 environment. This mismatch is causing errors and preventing the proof from being completed. \n\nTo improve the situation, we need to update our approach:\n\n1. Use Lean 4 syntax for tactics. For example, `by_contradiction` in Lean 4 is typically used with a lambda function.\n\n2. Be more explicit in our reasoning steps. Lean 4 often requires more detailed proof steps compared to Lean 3.\n\n3. Make use of Lean 4's more powerful `apply` tactic, which can often replace sequences of `intro` and `exact` tactics.\n\n4. Utilize Lean 4's pattern matching capabilities, particularly when dealing with implications and contradictions.\n\n5. Consider using `show` statements to make the proof structure clearer.\n\n6. Make sure to properly close all proof branches, as Lean 4 is stricter about this.\n\nIn the next iteration, we should start by rewriting the proof from scratch using Lean 4 syntax and tactics. We should also break down complex steps into smaller, more manageable parts, possibly using `have` statements to introduce intermediate results. This approach will make the proof easier to construct and debug in the Lean 4 environment.",
