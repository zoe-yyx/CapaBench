    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orExample:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves three propositions: P, Q, and R\n   - The goal is to prove: (P → R) → (Q → R) → (P ∨ Q → R)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypotheses: (P → R) and (Q → R)\n   - Aim to prove: P ∨ Q → R\n\n3. Use implication introduction:\n   - Assume P ∨ Q\n   - Show that this assumption leads to R\n\n4. Apply or-elimination (case analysis):\n   - Consider two cases: P is true or Q is true\n   - For each case, show that R follows\n\n5. Case 1: P is true\n   - Use the hypothesis (P → R) to deduce R\n\n6. Case 2: Q is true\n   - Use the hypothesis (Q → R) to deduce R\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Since R is true in both cases, we have proven P ∨ Q → R\n   - This completes the proof of the original implication\n\n8. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro (for introducing hypotheses and implications)\n   - apply (for using hypotheses)\n   - cases (for or-elimination)\n   - exact (for concluding with a proven statement)\n\nThis plan outlines a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem using standard logical reasoning and Lean 4 tactics. The player should focus on properly setting up the proof structure and handling the disjunction using case analysis.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we've successfully introduced the hypotheses and are now at the critical point of proving R given P ∨ Q. The next logical step is to apply or-elimination (case analysis) on the hypothesis hPQ : P ∨ Q.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We have introduced all necessary hypotheses: hPR (P → R), hQR (Q → R), and hPQ (P ∨ Q).\n2. Our goal is to prove R.\n3. Since we have P ∨ Q, we need to consider both cases: when P is true and when Q is true.\n4. We can use the 'cases' tactic to perform this or-elimination.\n5. After applying 'cases', we'll need to prove R in both scenarios.\n6. For each case, we can use the corresponding hypothesis (hPR or hQR) to deduce R.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to apply the 'cases' tactic on hPQ. This will split our proof into two cases, allowing us to handle each disjunct separately and prove R in both scenarios.\n",
