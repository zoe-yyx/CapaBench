    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orExample:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves three propositions: P, Q, and R\n   - The goal is to prove: (P → R) → (Q → R) → (P ∨ Q → R)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypotheses: (P → R) and (Q → R)\n   - Aim to prove: P ∨ Q → R\n\n3. Use implication introduction:\n   - Assume P ∨ Q\n   - Show that this assumption leads to R\n\n4. Apply or-elimination (case analysis):\n   - Consider two cases: P is true or Q is true\n   - For each case, show that R follows\n\n5. Case 1: P is true\n   - Use the hypothesis (P → R) to deduce R\n\n6. Case 2: Q is true\n   - Use the hypothesis (Q → R) to deduce R\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Since R is true in both cases, we have proven P ∨ Q → R\n   - This completes the proof of the original implication\n\n8. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro (for introducing hypotheses and implications)\n   - apply (for using hypotheses)\n   - cases (for or-elimination)\n   - exact (for concluding with a proven statement)\n\nThis plan outlines a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem using standard logical reasoning and Lean 4 tactics. The player should focus on properly setting up the proof structure and handling the disjunction using case analysis.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to set up the structure of the proof according to the theorem statement. The theorem has the form of multiple implications, so we should use the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypotheses and set up the goal.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to introduce three hypotheses: two for the antecedents of the main implication, and one for the antecedent of the consequent.\n2. The first two introductions will be for (P → R) and (Q → R).\n3. The third introduction will be for (P ∨ Q).\n4. After these introductions, our goal will be to prove R.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the `intro` tactic three times to set up the proof structure. This will align with steps 2 and 3 of our strategic proving plan.\n\nThe next action should be to use `intro` three times, giving appropriate names to the introduced hypotheses for clarity. Suggested names could be:\n- `hPR` for (P → R)\n- `hQR` for (Q → R)\n- `hPQ` for (P ∨ Q)\n\nThis setup will prepare us for the case analysis on P ∨ Q in the subsequent steps.\n",
