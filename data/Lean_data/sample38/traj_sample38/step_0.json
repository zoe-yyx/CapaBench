    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We're working with an inductive type 'Tree' with two constructors: leaf and node.\n   - The theorem 'nodeInjValue' aims to prove that if two nodes are equal, their values must be equal.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use pattern matching on the equality of the nodes.\n   - Exploit the injectivity property of constructors in inductive types.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Start with an intro tactic to bring the hypothesis into the local context.\n   b. Use the injection tactic on the equality hypothesis to break it down into equalities of its components.\n   c. Focus on the equality of the values (v1 and v2).\n   d. Use the rfl (reflexivity) tactic to prove v1 = v2.\n\n4. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of the other components (l1, r1, l2, r2) that aren't directly relevant to the conclusion.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - This proof doesn't require induction since we're only dealing with the node constructor.\n   - The theorem can be useful for future proofs about Tree structures where node values are important.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, check that all goals are closed and the theorem is accepted by Lean.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem nodeInjValue, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin by introducing the hypothesis into the local context. This will give us an assumption to work with.\n\n2. Use the injection tactic on the equality hypothesis (node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2). This will break down the equality of the nodes into equalities of their components.\n\n3. After injection, we should have three new hypotheses: one for the equality of left subtrees (l1 = l2), one for the values (v1 = v2), and one for the right subtrees (r1 = r2).\n\n4. Since our goal is to prove v1 = v2, we can directly use the hypothesis generated from the injection that states v1 = v2.\n\n5. Use the rfl (reflexivity) tactic to prove v1 = v2, as we now have this equality as a hypothesis.\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, the acting agent should start with the intro tactic to bring the hypothesis into the local context. This will set up the groundwork for the subsequent steps in the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof was completed successfully, but the tactic 'exact' was unnecessary as the goal was already solved after the injection tactic.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'exact hv' line as it's redundant, and consider adding a final 'rfl' tactic to explicitly close the proof if desired for clarity.\n```\n\nThe current proof process was largely correct and achieved the desired result. The intro tactic correctly brought the hypothesis into the local context, and the injection tactic effectively broke down the equality of the nodes, providing us with the needed equality v1 = v2.\n\nHowever, after the injection tactic, the goal was already solved. The Lean 4 proof assistant recognized that the goal v1 = v2 matched exactly with one of the equalities generated by the injection, and automatically closed the proof. This is why we see the \"no goals to be solved\" error message.\n\nThe 'exact hv' line, while logically correct, was unnecessary because the proof was already complete. In future proofs, we should be more attentive to when goals are automatically solved by Lean.\n\nFor improved clarity and explicitness, we could consider adding a 'rfl' tactic at the end of the proof. While not strictly necessary in this case, it can serve as a clear indicator that the proof is complete and that the final equality holds by reflexivity.\n\nIn future proofs, we should:\n1. Pay closer attention to the state of the goal after each tactic.\n2. Avoid using unnecessary tactics when the goal is already solved.\n3. Consider using explicit closing tactics like 'rfl' when appropriate, even if the proof is already complete, for better readability and understanding.\n\nThese adjustments will lead to more efficient and cleaner proofs in the future.",
