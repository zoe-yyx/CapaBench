    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We're working with an inductive type 'Tree' with two constructors: leaf and node.\n   - The theorem 'nodeInjValue' aims to prove that if two nodes are equal, their values must be equal.\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use pattern matching on the equality of the nodes.\n   - Exploit the injectivity property of constructors in inductive types.\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Start with an intro tactic to bring the hypothesis into the local context.\n   b. Use the injection tactic on the equality hypothesis to break it down into equalities of its components.\n   c. Focus on the equality of the values (v1 and v2).\n   d. Use the rfl (reflexivity) tactic to prove v1 = v2.\n\n4. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of the other components (l1, r1, l2, r2) that aren't directly relevant to the conclusion.\n\n5. Additional considerations:\n   - This proof doesn't require induction since we're only dealing with the node constructor.\n   - The theorem can be useful for future proofs about Tree structures where node values are important.\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, check that all goals are closed and the theorem is accepted by Lean.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof is logically correct and successfully proves the theorem. However, we encountered an error due to an unnecessary tactic at the end. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. The proof is actually complete after the 'injection' tactic. The 'injection h with _ hv _' step not only broke down the equality of the nodes but also automatically solved the goal v1 = v2.\n\n2. The error occurred because we added an unnecessary 'rfl' tactic when there were no more goals to solve.\n\n3. To fix this, we should simply remove the 'rfl' tactic at the end of the proof.\n\n4. The complete and correct proof should only consist of two tactics:\n   - intro h\n   - injection h with _ hv _\n\n5. This simplified proof is not only correct but also more concise and efficient.\n\n6. For future proofs, it's important to check the proof state after each tactic, especially after powerful tactics like 'injection', as they might solve the goal automatically.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should modify the proof by removing the 'rfl' tactic, leaving only the 'intro' and 'injection' tactics. This will resolve the error and complete the proof correctly.\n",
