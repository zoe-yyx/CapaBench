    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for treeExample3TreeReverse:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that treeReverse treeExample3a equals treeExample3b.\n   - We need to use the definitions of treeExample3a, treeExample3b, and treeReverse.\n\n2. Expand Definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3a.\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Apply treeReverse to treeExample3a step by step.\n\n3. Apply treeReverse:\n   - Start with the outermost node of treeExample3a.\n   - Recursively apply treeReverse to the left and right subtrees.\n   - Pay attention to how the structure changes at each step.\n\n4. Compare Results:\n   - After fully applying treeReverse to treeExample3a, compare the result with treeExample3b.\n   - Ensure that the node values and structure match exactly.\n\n5. Use Simplification:\n   - Use Lean's simplification tactics to reduce complex expressions.\n   - This may involve expanding definitions and applying function definitions.\n\n6. Prove Equality:\n   - Once the structures are simplified, prove that they are equal.\n   - This might be done automatically by Lean's equality reasoning.\n\n7. Handle Nested Structures:\n   - Pay special attention to the nested treeExample2a and treeExample2b within the larger trees.\n   - Ensure that these nested structures are correctly reversed.\n\n8. Utilize Symmetry:\n   - If needed, use the symmetry of equality to rewrite the goal in a more convenient form.\n\n9. Reflect on the Proof:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof corresponds to the definition of treeReverse.\n   - Verify that the proof covers all aspects of the tree structure, including leaves and nodes at different levels.\n\nThis plan should guide the player through the process of proving the theorem by systematically applying the treeReverse function and comparing the resulting structures.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is progressing well, but we need to adjust our approach slightly. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've successfully expanded treeExample3a and applied treeReverse, which has given us a fully expanded left-hand side of the equation.\n\n2. The error occurred because we tried to unfold treeExample2a, which no longer exists in its original form after applying treeReverse.\n\n3. Instead of trying to further manipulate the left-hand side, we should now focus on the right-hand side of the equation (treeExample3b).\n\n4. Our next steps should be:\n   a. Unfold treeExample3b to expand its structure.\n   b. Within the expanded treeExample3b, unfold treeExample2b to fully expose its structure.\n\n5. After these steps, both sides of the equation should be fully expanded and in a form that can be directly compared.\n\n6. Once both sides are fully expanded, we can use reflexivity (rfl) to prove their equality, as the structures should match exactly.\n\nThis approach avoids the error we encountered and should lead to a successful completion of the proof. Remember, we're working with the result of treeReverse applied to treeExample3a on the left side, so we need to make the right side match this structure.\n",
