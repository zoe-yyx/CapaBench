    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for treeExample3TreeReverse:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that treeReverse treeExample3a equals treeExample3b.\n   - We need to use the definitions of treeExample3a, treeExample3b, and treeReverse.\n\n2. Expand Definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3a.\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Apply treeReverse to treeExample3a step by step.\n\n3. Apply treeReverse:\n   - Start with the outermost node of treeExample3a.\n   - Recursively apply treeReverse to the left and right subtrees.\n   - Pay attention to how the structure changes at each step.\n\n4. Compare Results:\n   - After fully applying treeReverse to treeExample3a, compare the result with treeExample3b.\n   - Ensure that the node values and structure match exactly.\n\n5. Use Simplification:\n   - Use Lean's simplification tactics to reduce complex expressions.\n   - This may involve expanding definitions and applying function definitions.\n\n6. Prove Equality:\n   - Once the structures are simplified, prove that they are equal.\n   - This might be done automatically by Lean's equality reasoning.\n\n7. Handle Nested Structures:\n   - Pay special attention to the nested treeExample2a and treeExample2b within the larger trees.\n   - Ensure that these nested structures are correctly reversed.\n\n8. Utilize Symmetry:\n   - If needed, use the symmetry of equality to rewrite the goal in a more convenient form.\n\n9. Reflect on the Proof:\n   - Ensure that each step of the proof corresponds to the definition of treeReverse.\n   - Verify that the proof covers all aspects of the tree structure, including leaves and nodes at different levels.\n\nThis plan should guide the player through the process of proving the theorem by systematically applying the treeReverse function and comparing the resulting structures.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem treeExample3TreeReverse, we need to start by expanding the definitions of treeExample3a and treeExample3b, and then apply the treeReverse function to treeExample3a. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Expand the definition of treeExample3a:\n   treeExample3a is defined as node (node leaf 3 leaf) 5 treeExample2a\n   We should expand this definition to see the full structure of the tree.\n\n2. Apply treeReverse to treeExample3a:\n   - For the outermost node, we'll reverse its left and right subtrees.\n   - The left subtree (node leaf 3 leaf) will become the right subtree.\n   - The right subtree (treeExample2a) will become the left subtree, but it needs to be reversed.\n\n3. Focus on reversing treeExample2a:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample2a.\n   - Apply treeReverse to each part of treeExample2a.\n\n4. Simplify the resulting expression:\n   - After applying treeReverse to all parts, simplify the expression.\n   - This should result in a structure that matches treeExample3b.\n\n5. Compare with treeExample3b:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Verify that the resulting structure from reversing treeExample3a matches treeExample3b.\n\nThe acting agent should start by expanding the definitions and applying treeReverse step by step, following the structure of the tree from the outermost node inward. Each step should be clearly stated and justified based on the definition of treeReverse.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because it tried to unfold 'treeExample2a' after it had already been simplified by the treeReverse function.\n\nImprovement: We should remove the unnecessary step of unfolding 'treeExample2a' and instead focus on unfolding 'treeExample3b' to match the already simplified left-hand side of the equation.\n```\n\nThe current proof strategy was on the right track, but it made an unnecessary step that led to an error. After applying treeReverse and simplifying, the left-hand side of the equation was fully expanded, and there was no need to unfold treeExample2a further.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Keep the steps of unfolding treeExample3a and applying treeReverse.\n2. Remove the step that tries to unfold treeExample2a.\n3. Focus on unfolding treeExample3b and treeExample2b on the right-hand side of the equation.\n4. After these steps, both sides of the equation should be fully expanded and match exactly.\n\nThis approach should lead to a successful proof without encountering the error we saw in this attempt. The acting agent should implement these changes in the next iteration of the proof.",
