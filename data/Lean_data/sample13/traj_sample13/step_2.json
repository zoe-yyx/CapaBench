Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem 'shift_left1_square'\n   - We need to show that shift_left1 square x = (x + 1) * (x + 1) for any integer x\n\n2. Analyze the definitions:\n   - Understand the 'square' function: square x = x * x\n   - Understand the 'shift_left1' function: shift_left1 f x = f (x + 1)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side: shift_left1 square x\n   b. Expand the definition of shift_left1\n   c. Apply the definition of square to the result\n   d. Simplify the expression\n   e. Show that the result equals the right-hand side: (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'rw' (rewrite) to expand definitions and substitute expressions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification if needed\n   - Use 'ring' for algebraic simplifications\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of parentheses when expanding definitions\n   - Be mindful of the order of operations in integer arithmetic\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After each step, ensure the goal state matches the expected intermediate result\n   - The final step should show that both sides of the equation are identical\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, but we need to fully expand the 'square' function to finish it. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We have successfully expanded the 'shift_left1' function, which was a good start.\n2. We've also applied the 'square' function once, but it needs to be expanded one more time.\n3. The current goal state is: ⊢ square (x + 1) = (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n4. To complete the proof, we should:\n   a. Apply 'rw [square]' one more time to expand the remaining 'square' function on the left-hand side.\n   b. After this expansion, both sides of the equation should be identical.\n   c. Once the sides are identical, we can use 'rfl' (reflexivity) to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach will fully expand all definitions and demonstrate that the left-hand side is indeed equal to the right-hand side, thus proving the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempted to rewrite the 'square' function twice, which is incorrect as it can only be expanded once.\n\nImprovement: Remove the redundant 'rw [square]' step and proceed directly to 'rfl' after the first expansion of the 'square' function.\n```\n\nThe current proof strategy was close but contained a small error. After expanding 'shift_left1' and 'square' once each, the goal became ⊢ square (x + 1) = (x + 1) * (x + 1). At this point, the left-hand side is already fully expanded according to the definition of 'square', so attempting to expand it again with another 'rw [square]' leads to an error.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n1. Keep the first two rewrite steps (rw [shift_left1] and rw [square]).\n2. Remove the redundant 'rw [square]' step.\n3. Use 'rfl' immediately after the first 'rw [square]' to complete the proof.\n\nThis adjustment will align the proof steps with the actual definitions and structure of the functions involved, leading to a successful proof of the theorem.",
