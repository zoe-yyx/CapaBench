Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem 'shift_left1_square'\n   - We need to show that shift_left1 square x = (x + 1) * (x + 1) for any integer x\n\n2. Analyze the definitions:\n   - Understand the 'square' function: square x = x * x\n   - Understand the 'shift_left1' function: shift_left1 f x = f (x + 1)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side: shift_left1 square x\n   b. Expand the definition of shift_left1\n   c. Apply the definition of square to the result\n   d. Simplify the expression\n   e. Show that the result equals the right-hand side: (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'rw' (rewrite) to expand definitions and substitute expressions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification if needed\n   - Use 'ring' for algebraic simplifications\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of parentheses when expanding definitions\n   - Be mindful of the order of operations in integer arithmetic\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After each step, ensure the goal state matches the expected intermediate result\n   - The final step should show that both sides of the equation are identical\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof for the theorem 'shift_left1_square' has been successfully completed, but there's an unnecessary tactic at the end. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. The proof was correct and complete after expanding the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'square' using the 'rw' tactic.\n\n2. The 'rfl' tactic at the end is unnecessary because Lean was able to recognize that both sides of the equation were identical after expanding 'square'.\n\n3. To improve the proof, we should remove the 'rfl' tactic and end the proof immediately after 'rw [square]'.\n\n4. It's important to note that Lean's simplification capabilities were sufficient to complete the proof without additional steps.\n\n5. For future proofs, we should be more attentive to Lean's output after each tactic to recognize when a proof is complete.\n\n6. The final proof should look like this:\n\n   theorem shift_left1_square (x : ℤ) : shift_left1 square x = (x + 1) * (x + 1) := by\n     rw [shift_left1]\n     rw [square]\n\nThis concise proof accurately demonstrates the equality without unnecessary steps.\n",
