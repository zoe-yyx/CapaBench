    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem 'shift_left1_square', we need to show that shift_left1 square x = (x + 1) * (x + 1) for any integer x. Let's start by breaking down the left-hand side of the equation.\n\n1. Begin with the term 'shift_left1 square x'.\n\n2. Expand the definition of 'shift_left1'. According to the definition, shift_left1 f x = f (x + 1). In our case, f is the 'square' function. So, we can rewrite this as:\n   shift_left1 square x = square (x + 1)\n\n3. Now, we need to expand the 'square' function. The definition of square is square x = x * x. Applying this to our current expression:\n   square (x + 1) = (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\n4. At this point, we've shown that:\n   shift_left1 square x = (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\n5. This is exactly what we needed to prove, as it matches the right-hand side of our theorem statement.\n\nTo implement this proof, the acting agent should use the following tactics:\n\na) Use 'rw' to expand the definition of 'shift_left1'.\nb) Use 'rw' again to expand the definition of 'square'.\nc) The resulting goal should already match the right-hand side of the theorem, so no further steps should be necessary.\n\nIf any simplification is needed after these steps, the 'simp' or 'ring' tactic can be used, but it's likely not necessary in this case.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof was correct up until the last step, but the use of 'rfl' tactic was inappropriate as the goal still required further simplification.\nImprovement: Replace the final 'rfl' tactic with 'rw [square]' to fully expand the definition of 'square' for the remaining (x + 1) term, which should complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe reasoning and action steps were mostly correct, following the planned approach. The definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'square' were correctly expanded using the 'rw' tactic. However, the final step using 'rfl' (reflexivity) was premature, as the goal still contained the 'square' function applied to (x + 1).\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Keep the first two 'rw' steps as they are correct and necessary.\n2. Replace the 'rfl' tactic with another application of 'rw [square]' to fully expand the definition of 'square' for the (x + 1) term.\n3. After this step, the goal should be in a form where 'rfl' can be successfully applied to complete the proof.\n\nThis adjustment should align perfectly with the theorem's statement and complete the proof rigorously without any need for 'sorry' or additional tactics.",
