Analyze the definitions:\n   - Understand the 'square' function: square x = x * x\n   - Understand the 'shift_left1' function: shift_left1 f x = f (x + 1)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side: shift_left1 square x\n   b. Expand the definition of shift_left1\n   c. Apply the definition of square to the result\n   d. Simplify the expression\n   e. Show that the result equals the right-hand side: (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'rw' (rewrite) to expand definitions and substitute expressions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification if needed\n   - Use 'ring' for algebraic simplifications\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of parentheses when expanding definitions\n   - Be mindful of the order of operations in integer arithmetic\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After each step, ensure the goal state matches the expected intermediate result\n   - The final step should show that both sides of the equation are identical\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is very close to completion. We have successfully expanded the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'square', which has brought us to the goal:\n\n⊢ square (x + 1) = (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\nAt this point, we can observe that the left-hand side 'square (x + 1)' is exactly the definition of the 'square' function applied to '(x + 1)'. The right-hand side '(x + 1) * (x + 1)' is already in its expanded form.\n\nGiven that the 'square' function is defined as 'square (x : ℤ) : ℤ := x * x', we can see that both sides of the equation are identical.\n\nTherefore, the next and final step should be to use the 'rfl' (reflexivity) tactic. This tactic will recognize that both sides of the equation are syntactically equal and complete the proof.\n\nNo further expansions or rewrites are necessary. The 'rfl' tactic is sufficient to finish the proof at this stage.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here is my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof was successfully completed before reaching the 'rfl' tactic, leaving no goals to be solved.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'rfl' tactic as it's unnecessary, and ensure the proof ends after the 'rw [square]' step.\n```\n\nThe proof process was correct up until the final step. The definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'square' were properly expanded, which brought the goal to its final form. However, it appears that the proof was already completed after these expansions, likely due to Lean's ability to recognize that both sides of the equation were identical after expanding 'square'.\n\nFor future proofs, we should:\n\n1. Be more attentive to when the proof is completed. In this case, the proof was done after expanding 'square'.\n2. Avoid adding unnecessary tactics. The 'rfl' tactic was not needed here as the proof was already complete.\n3. Consider using tactics like 'sorry' or 'admit' during the proving process to check intermediate states, but ensure they are removed in the final proof.\n4. Pay closer attention to Lean's output after each tactic to understand the current state of the proof.\n\nThese insights should help in crafting more efficient and clean proofs in future problems.",
