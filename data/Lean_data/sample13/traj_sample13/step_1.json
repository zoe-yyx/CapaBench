Analyze the definitions:\n   - Understand the 'square' function: square x = x * x\n   - Understand the 'shift_left1' function: shift_left1 f x = f (x + 1)\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side: shift_left1 square x\n   b. Expand the definition of shift_left1\n   c. Apply the definition of square to the result\n   d. Simplify the expression\n   e. Show that the result equals the right-hand side: (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'rw' (rewrite) to expand definitions and substitute expressions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification if needed\n   - Use 'ring' for algebraic simplifications\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of parentheses when expanding definitions\n   - Be mindful of the order of operations in integer arithmetic\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After each step, ensure the goal state matches the expected intermediate result\n   - The final step should show that both sides of the equation are identical\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, but we need to make one final expansion of the 'square' function. The current goal state is:\n\n⊢ square (x + 1) = (x + 1) * (x + 1)\n\nWe can see that the left-hand side still contains the 'square' function applied to (x + 1). To complete the proof, we need to:\n\n1. Expand the definition of 'square' on the left-hand side.\n2. This expansion will make both sides of the equation identical.\n3. Once the sides are identical, we can use reflexivity to conclude the proof.\n\nThe next step should be to use the 'rw' tactic one more time to expand the 'square' function, followed by the 'rfl' tactic to finish the proof. This approach will directly address the flaw identified in the reflection and complete the theorem without any gaps in reasoning.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof stopped short of fully expanding the 'square' function, leaving the goal unresolved.\n\nImprovement: Expand the 'square' function definition one more time using 'rw [square]' before applying 'rfl' to complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt made good progress but fell just short of completion. The key issue is that while the 'shift_left1' function was correctly expanded, the 'square' function was not fully expanded in the final step. This leaves us with a goal that still contains the 'square' function applied to (x + 1) on the left-hand side, while the right-hand side is already in its expanded form.\n\nTo improve the proof, we need to take one more step to expand the 'square' function. This can be done by applying the 'rw [square]' tactic one more time. After this expansion, both sides of the equation will be identical, allowing us to use 'rfl' to complete the proof.\n\nThe revised proof structure should look like this:\n1. Expand shift_left1 (already done)\n2. Expand square (needs to be done twice, once for the outer application and once for the inner)\n3. Apply reflexivity\n\nThis approach will ensure that all definitions are fully expanded, and the proof is completed rigorously without any remaining unexpanded terms.",
