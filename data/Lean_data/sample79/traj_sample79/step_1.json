    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named 'andAssoc2'\n   - It involves three propositions: P, Q, and R\n   - The goal is to prove: (P ∧ Q) ∧ R → P ∧ (Q ∧ R)\n\n2. Understand the logical structure:\n   - This is an implication (→)\n   - The left side is a nested conjunction: (P ∧ Q) ∧ R\n   - The right side is also a nested conjunction: P ∧ (Q ∧ R)\n   - We need to prove that the left side implies the right side\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis:\n      - Assume (P ∧ Q) ∧ R is true\n   \n   b. Break down the left side:\n      - Extract P ∧ Q from (P ∧ Q) ∧ R\n      - Extract R from (P ∧ Q) ∧ R\n      - Extract P and Q from P ∧ Q\n   \n   c. Construct the right side:\n      - Prove Q ∧ R using Q and R\n      - Prove P ∧ (Q ∧ R) using P and (Q ∧ R)\n\n4. Consider tactics to use:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - cases: to break down conjunctions\n   - constructor: to build new conjunctions\n   - exact: to use extracted propositions\n\n5. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of nested conjunctions\n   - Pay attention to the order of propositions when reconstructing\n\n6. Reflect on the proof structure:\n   - This proof primarily involves deconstructing and reconstructing conjunctions\n   - The key is to extract all individual propositions and then recombine them in the desired order\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current goal is to prove P ∧ Q ∧ R given the hypothesis h : (P ∧ Q) ∧ R. We need to deconstruct the hypothesis to access its components and then reconstruct the desired conjunction.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis h using the 'intro' tactic.\n2. Now, we need to break down the hypothesis h : (P ∧ Q) ∧ R into its components.\n3. We can use the 'cases' tactic to deconstruct the outer conjunction of h.\n4. After that, we'll have two new hypotheses: one for P ∧ Q and another for R.\n5. We'll need to further deconstruct P ∧ Q to get individual hypotheses for P and Q.\n6. Once we have separate hypotheses for P, Q, and R, we can reconstruct P ∧ Q ∧ R.\n7. To reconstruct, we'll use the 'constructor' tactic twice:\n   - First to prove P ∧ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Then to prove Q ∧ R within the previous construction\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to use the 'cases' tactic on h to start breaking down the hypothesis.\n",
