    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named 'andAssoc2'\n   - It involves three propositions: P, Q, and R\n   - The goal is to prove: (P ∧ Q) ∧ R → P ∧ (Q ∧ R)\n\n2. Understand the logical structure:\n   - This is an implication (→)\n   - The left side is a nested conjunction: (P ∧ Q) ∧ R\n   - The right side is also a nested conjunction: P ∧ (Q ∧ R)\n   - We need to prove that the left side implies the right side\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis:\n      - Assume (P ∧ Q) ∧ R is true\n   \n   b. Break down the left side:\n      - Extract P ∧ Q from (P ∧ Q) ∧ R\n      - Extract R from (P ∧ Q) ∧ R\n      - Extract P and Q from P ∧ Q\n   \n   c. Construct the right side:\n      - Prove Q ∧ R using Q and R\n      - Prove P ∧ (Q ∧ R) using P and (Q ∧ R)\n\n4. Consider tactics to use:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - cases: to break down conjunctions\n   - constructor: to build new conjunctions\n   - exact: to use extracted propositions\n\n5. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of nested conjunctions\n   - Pay attention to the order of propositions when reconstructing\n\n6. Reflect on the proof structure:\n   - This proof primarily involves deconstructing and reconstructing conjunctions\n   - The key is to extract all individual propositions and then recombine them in the desired order\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to introduce the hypothesis. The theorem statement is an implication, so we need to assume the left side of the implication and prove the right side.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We should start by introducing the hypothesis (P ∧ Q) ∧ R.\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we'll need to break it down to access its components.\n3. The introduction can be done using the 'intro' tactic, which is commonly used in Lean 4 to introduce hypotheses in implication proofs.\n4. After the introduction, we'll have a hypothesis in our context that represents (P ∧ Q) ∧ R, which we can then work with to prove P ∧ (Q ∧ R).\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to use the 'intro' tactic to bring the hypothesis into our proof context. This will set us up for the subsequent steps of breaking down the conjunction and reconstructing it in the desired form.\n",
