Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the square of any integer is non-negative.\n   - The theorem is named 'nonneg_square'.\n   - We're working with integers (ℤ).\n   - We have definitions for 'square' and 'nonneg'.\n\n2. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Expand the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'.\n   b. Use the property that the product of an integer with itself is always non-negative.\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Unfold the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'.\n   b. Rewrite the goal to show x * x ≥ 0.\n   c. Use a known theorem about the non-negativity of squares (if available in Mathlib).\n   d. If no such theorem is readily available, consider proving it directly:\n      - Case split on whether x is positive, negative, or zero.\n      - For each case, show that x * x ≥ 0.\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - unfold (for expanding definitions)\n   - rw (for rewriting)\n   - cases (if we need to consider different cases)\n   - have (for introducing intermediate steps)\n   - apply (to apply existing theorems)\n   - linarith (for linear arithmetic reasoning, which might be useful here)\n\n5. Reflection points:\n   - Consider if there's a more elegant way to prove this using existing theorems in Mathlib.\n   - Think about how this theorem might be used in future proofs involving squares or non-negative integers.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem nonneg_square, we should start by unfolding the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'. This will allow us to see the explicit goal we need to prove in terms of basic integer operations.\n\nAfter unfolding, our goal will likely be to show that x * x ≥ 0 for any integer x. This is a well-known property of integer multiplication, but we may need to prove it explicitly if there isn't a readily available theorem in Mathlib.\n\nGiven that we're working with integers and inequalities, the linarith tactic might be useful. However, we should first try to simplify the goal and see if we can apply any existing theorems about non-negative integers or squares.\n\nIf no direct theorem is available, we might need to consider a case split on the sign of x (positive, negative, or zero). However, let's start with the simplest approach and adjust our strategy based on the resulting goal after unfolding the definitions.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following steps for the acting agent:\n\n1. Unfold the definitions of 'square' and 'nonneg'.\n2. Examine the resulting goal.\n3. If the goal is in a form that can be directly solved by linarith or by applying a known theorem, do so.\n4. If not, we'll reassess and consider a case-by-case approach or look for relevant theorems about integer squares.\n",
