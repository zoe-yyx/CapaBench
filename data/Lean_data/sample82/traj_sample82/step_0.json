    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for orAssoc2:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves logical disjunction (∨) and implication (→)\n   - We need to prove: (P ∨ Q) ∨ R → P ∨ (Q ∨ R)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the 'intro' tactic to introduce the hypothesis\n   - Name the hypothesis something meaningful, like 'h'\n\n3. Break down the left-hand side:\n   - Use 'cases' tactic on the outermost disjunction of the hypothesis\n   - This will give us two cases to consider:\n     a) P ∨ Q\n     b) R\n\n4. Handle the 'R' case:\n   - If we have R, we can directly prove P ∨ (Q ∨ R)\n   - Use 'right' tactic to choose the right side of the main disjunction\n   - Then use 'right' again to prove Q ∨ R\n\n5. Handle the 'P ∨ Q' case:\n   - Use 'cases' tactic again to split this into two subcases:\n     a) P\n     b) Q\n\n6. For the 'P' subcase:\n   - Use 'left' tactic to prove P ∨ (Q ∨ R) directly\n\n7. For the 'Q' subcase:\n   - Use 'right' tactic to focus on proving Q ∨ R\n   - Then use 'left' tactic to prove Q ∨ R\n\n8. Conclude the proof:\n   - The 'cases' tactic should automatically close the proof when all cases are handled\n\nThis plan leverages the structure of disjunctions and follows a systematic approach to cover all possible cases, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the first steps of our strategic proving plan.\n\n1. We need to begin by introducing the hypothesis. This is typically done using the 'intro' tactic in Lean 4.\n\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we'll want to break down the left-hand side of the implication, which is (P ∨ Q) ∨ R. The best way to do this is by using the 'cases' tactic on the outermost disjunction.\n\n3. These steps will set up the structure for the rest of our proof, allowing us to handle each case separately as outlined in the plan.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent start with the 'intro' tactic to introduce the hypothesis, followed by the 'cases' tactic to break down the left-hand side of the implication. This will create a solid foundation for the subsequent steps in our proof.\n",
