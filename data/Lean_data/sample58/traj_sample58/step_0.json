Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the 'use' tactic to provide a specific value for n\n   - Choose n = 2, as 2 + 2 = 4\n\n4. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the 'use 2' tactic to instantiate n with 2\n   b. The goal will then change to proving 4 = 2 + 2\n   c. This equality is true by definition, so it should be solved automatically\n\n5. Consider potential tactics:\n   - The 'rfl' (reflexivity) tactic might be sufficient to prove the final equality\n   - If 'rfl' doesn't work, consider using 'norm_num' for numerical calculations\n\n6. Prepare for reflection:\n   - After implementing the proof, reflect on its conciseness and clarity\n   - Consider if there are alternative ways to prove the theorem\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem 'fourIsEven', we need to show that there exists a natural number n such that 4 = n + n. The planning strategy suggests using n = 2, which is a good choice as 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nGiven that we haven't taken any actions yet, our first step should be to use the 'use' tactic to provide the specific value for n. This will instantiate the existential quantifier and change our goal.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n1. Use the 'use' tactic with the value 2.\n2. This will introduce 2 as the witness for n in our existential statement.\n3. After using this tactic, our goal should change to proving 4 = 2 + 2.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with the 'use 2' tactic as the next operation. This will set up the proof structure and allow us to focus on proving the resulting equality in the subsequent step.\n",
