    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that the function 'plus_one' is monotonic.\n   - 'plus_one' is defined as adding 1 to any integer.\n   - The 'mono' property is defined for a function f: ℤ → ℤ, where f(n) ≤ f(m) whenever n ≤ m.\n\n2. Set Up the Proof:\n   - Begin by unfolding the definition of 'mono' for 'plus_one'.\n   - This will introduce universal quantifiers for n and m, and an implication.\n\n3. Prove the Monotonicity:\n   - Assume n ≤ m for arbitrary integers n and m.\n   - Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m.\n   - This can be done by:\n     a) Expanding the definition of plus_one.\n     b) Using the property that adding the same number to both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality.\n\n4. Use Lean Tactics:\n   - Utilize 'intros' to introduce the arbitrary n and m and the assumption n ≤ m.\n   - Use 'unfold' to expand the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one'.\n   - Apply 'linarith' tactic, which is good for solving linear integer inequalities.\n\n5. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Once linarith solves the inequality, the proof should be complete.\n   - If needed, use 'rfl' (reflexivity) to finish off any remaining goals.\n\n6. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed and the theorem is proven.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The 'intros n m h' step has already unfolded the 'mono' definition for us, giving us the goal 'plus_one n ≤ plus_one m'. This explains why the subsequent 'unfold mono' step failed.\n\n2. We need to focus on unfolding the 'plus_one' function to expose the actual integer operations. This will transform our goal from 'plus_one n ≤ plus_one m' to 'n + 1 ≤ m + 1'.\n\n3. After unfolding 'plus_one', we'll have a linear inequality that can be solved by the 'linarith' tactic, given our hypothesis 'h : n ≤ m'.\n\n4. The proof structure should be:\n   a) Keep the 'intros n m h' step as it correctly introduces our variables and hypothesis.\n   b) Use 'unfold plus_one' to expand the definition of the 'plus_one' function.\n   c) Apply 'linarith' to solve the resulting linear inequality.\n\n5. This approach should be sufficient to prove the theorem without any additional steps or tactics.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should modify the proof by removing the 'unfold mono' step, ensuring that 'plus_one' is properly unfolded, and then applying 'linarith'. This adjusted sequence of tactics should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
