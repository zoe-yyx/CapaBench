    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that the function 'plus_one' is monotonic.\n   - 'plus_one' is defined as adding 1 to any integer.\n   - The 'mono' property is defined for a function f: ℤ → ℤ, where f(n) ≤ f(m) whenever n ≤ m.\n\n2. Set Up the Proof:\n   - Begin by unfolding the definition of 'mono' for 'plus_one'.\n   - This will introduce universal quantifiers for n and m, and an implication.\n\n3. Prove the Monotonicity:\n   - Assume n ≤ m for arbitrary integers n and m.\n   - Show that plus_one n ≤ plus_one m.\n   - This can be done by:\n     a) Expanding the definition of plus_one.\n     b) Using the property that adding the same number to both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality.\n\n4. Use Lean Tactics:\n   - Utilize 'intros' to introduce the arbitrary n and m and the assumption n ≤ m.\n   - Use 'unfold' to expand the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one'.\n   - Apply 'linarith' tactic, which is good for solving linear integer inequalities.\n\n5. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Once linarith solves the inequality, the proof should be complete.\n   - If needed, use 'rfl' (reflexivity) to finish off any remaining goals.\n\n6. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed and the theorem is proven.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove that 'plus_one' is monotonic, we need to show that for any two integers n and m, if n ≤ m, then plus_one n ≤ plus_one m. Let's break this down into steps:\n\n1. First, we should introduce the variables n and m, and the hypothesis that n ≤ m. This sets up the context for our proof.\n\n2. Then, we need to unfold the definitions of 'mono' and 'plus_one' to work with their explicit forms.\n\n3. After unfolding, we'll have to prove that (n + 1) ≤ (m + 1), given that n ≤ m.\n\n4. This inequality is a straightforward consequence of the given hypothesis, as adding the same number to both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality.\n\n5. The 'linarith' tactic should be able to solve this kind of linear integer inequality automatically.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by introducing the variables and hypothesis, then unfold the necessary definitions. After that, applying the 'linarith' tactic should complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The 'unfold' tactic failed to unfold 'mono' because it was already unfolded during the 'intros' step.\nImprovement: Remove the unnecessary 'unfold mono' step and focus on unfolding 'plus_one' and applying 'linarith' to prove the inequality.\n```\n\nThe current approach had a logical flow in its reasoning, but the execution revealed an important detail that was overlooked. The 'mono' definition was automatically unfolded when we introduced the variables and hypothesis with 'intros n m h'. This explains why the subsequent attempt to unfold 'mono' failed.\n\nTo improve our proving process, we should:\n\n1. Recognize that 'intros' has already unfolded 'mono' for us, giving us the goal 'plus_one n ≤ plus_one m'.\n2. Focus on unfolding 'plus_one' to expose the actual integer operations.\n3. After unfolding 'plus_one', we should have a goal that looks like 'n + 1 ≤ m + 1'.\n4. At this point, 'linarith' should be able to solve the inequality given the hypothesis 'h : n ≤ m'.\n\nFor the next round, the acting agent should modify the proof to remove the 'unfold mono' step, ensure that 'plus_one' is properly unfolded, and then apply 'linarith'. This adjusted approach should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.",
