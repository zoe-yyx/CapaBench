Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) → (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n   - We need to prove that the left-hand side implies the right-hand side\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a)\n   - Aim to prove: (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n3.

Apply classical logic:\n   - Since the theorem is opened with \"open Classical\", we can use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the negation of what we want to prove: P a ∧ ¬Q a\n\n5. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the hypothesis (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) to our arbitrary 'a'\n   - This gives us: ¬ Q a → ¬ P a\n\n6. Derive a contradiction:\n   - From our assumption, we have ¬Q a, so we can apply modus ponens to get ¬P a\n   - But we also assumed P a, which contradicts ¬P a\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves that our assumption (P a ∧ ¬Q a) must be false\n   - Therefore, P a → Q a must be true for our arbitrary 'a'\n   - Since 'a' was arbitrary, this proves the universal quantification (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the initial steps of our plan.\n\n1. We need to introduce the hypothesis of the theorem. This involves assuming the left-hand side of the implication.\n\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we should aim to prove the right-hand side of the implication.\n\n3. To prove a universally quantified statement, we need to introduce an arbitrary element of type A.\n\n4. Since we're working in classical logic (as indicated by \"open Classical\"), we can use proof by contradiction. This means we can assume the negation of what we want to prove and aim for a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the next steps in the proof should be:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a)\n2. Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n3. Assume the negation of (P a → Q a), which is equivalent to (P a ∧ ¬Q a)\n\nThese steps will set up the proof structure and allow us to proceed with deriving the contradiction in subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy using 'by_contradiction' and subsequent steps were not recognized or executed properly by Lean 4.\n\nImprovement: Adjust the proof strategy to use Lean 4 compatible tactics, focusing on direct proof methods rather than proof by contradiction.\n```\n\nBased on the error messages and the current state of the proof, it appears that the 'by_contradiction' tactic and the subsequent steps were not recognized or executed properly in Lean 4. This suggests that our approach needs to be adjusted to align with Lean 4's syntax and available tactics.\n\nTo improve our next steps, we should:\n\n1. Avoid using 'by_contradiction' and instead focus on a direct proof method.\n2. Use Lean 4 compatible tactics to manipulate the goal and hypotheses.\n3. Utilize the given hypothesis 'h' more directly in the proof.\n4. Consider using the 'intro' tactic to break down the implication in the goal.\n5. Look for opportunities to apply modus ponens or other basic logical reasoning steps.\n\nFor the next iteration, we should start by introducing the antecedent of the implication in the goal (P a) as a hypothesis, and then work towards proving Q a using the given universal quantification h. This approach aligns better with the structure of the theorem and the available information in Lean 4.",
