Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) → (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n   - We need to prove that the left-hand side implies the right-hand side\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a)\n   - Aim to prove: (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n3. Use universal quantification:\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   - Show that P a → Q a holds for this arbitrary 'a'\n\n4. Apply classical logic:\n   - Since the theorem is opened with \"open Classical\", we can use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the negation of what we want to prove: P a ∧ ¬Q a\n\n5. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the hypothesis (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) to our arbitrary 'a'\n   - This gives us: ¬ Q a → ¬ P a\n\n6. Derive a contradiction:\n   - From our assumption, we have ¬Q a, so we can apply modus ponens to get ¬P a\n   - But we also assumed P a, which contradicts ¬P a\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves that our assumption (P a ∧ ¬Q a) must be false\n   - Therefore, P a → Q a must be true for our arbitrary 'a'\n   - Since 'a' was arbitrary, this proves the universal quantification (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis 'h' and an arbitrary element 'a' of type A.\n2. The current goal is to prove 'P a → Q a'.\n3. To prove an implication, we should introduce the antecedent as a hypothesis and then prove the consequent.\n4. After introducing 'P a' as a hypothesis, we need to prove 'Q a'.\n5. We can use the given hypothesis 'h' which states '∀ (a : A), ¬Q a → ¬P a'.\n6. By applying 'h' to our specific 'a', we get '¬Q a → ¬P a'.\n7. We can use proof by contradiction for 'Q a' specifically, assuming '¬Q a' and deriving a contradiction.\n8. From '¬Q a → ¬P a' and the assumed '¬Q a', we can derive '¬P a' by modus ponens.\n9. This '¬P a' contradicts our hypothesis 'P a', completing the proof by contradiction.\n10. Therefore, we can conclude 'Q a', which proves the implication 'P a → Q a'.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps using Lean 4 tactics, particularly 'intro', 'apply', and 'by_contra' for the specific contradiction on 'Q a'.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt used the 'by_contra' tactic, which is not available in Lean 4, leading to an \"unknown tactic\" error.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'by_contra' with 'byContradiction', the correct Lean 4 tactic for proof by contradiction, and adjust the subsequent steps accordingly.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the main issue in the previous attempt was the use of the 'by_contra' tactic, which is not available in Lean 4. This caused the proof to fail at that step, preventing further progress.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Use 'byContradiction' instead of 'by_contra' to initiate the proof by contradiction.\n2. Adjust the naming convention for the contradiction hypothesis to match Lean 4 style (e.g., 'hNotQ' instead of 'hnQa').\n3. Explicitly apply the universal quantifier in the hypothesis 'h' to 'a' before using it.\n4. Use 'apply' tactic to apply the implication from 'h a' directly, rather than creating a separate 'have' statement.\n5. Ensure that each step is properly completed with appropriate punctuation (periods or commas).\n\nThese adjustments should allow the proof to progress further and potentially complete successfully. The acting agent should implement these changes in the next attempt, paying close attention to Lean 4 specific syntax and tactics.",
