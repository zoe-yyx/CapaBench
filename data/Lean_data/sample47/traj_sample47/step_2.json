    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) → (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n   - We need to prove that the left-hand side implies the right-hand side\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a)\n   - Aim to prove: (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n3. Use universal quantification:\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   - Show that P a → Q a holds for this arbitrary 'a'\n\n4. Apply classical logic:\n   - Since the theorem is opened with \"open Classical\", we can use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the negation of what we want to prove: P a ∧ ¬Q a\n\n5. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the hypothesis (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) to our arbitrary 'a'\n   - This gives us: ¬ Q a → ¬ P a\n\n6. Derive a contradiction:\n   - From our assumption, we have ¬Q a, so we can apply modus ponens to get ¬P a\n   - But we also assumed P a, which contradicts ¬P a\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves that our assumption (P a ∧ ¬Q a) must be false\n   - Therefore, P a → Q a must be true for our arbitrary 'a'\n   - Since 'a' was arbitrary, this proves the universal quantification (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n8. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis 'h', an arbitrary element 'a', and the antecedent 'hPa'. Now we need to prove 'Q a'.\n\n2. Since we're working in classical logic and want to prove 'Q a', we can use proof by contradiction. In Lean 4, we should use the 'byContradiction' tactic.\n\n3. After introducing the contradiction hypothesis, we'll need to apply the universal quantifier in 'h' to our specific 'a', then use the resulting implication.\n\n4. We can then apply this implication directly to our contradiction hypothesis to obtain '¬P a'.\n\n5. Finally, we can use the 'contradiction' tactic to complete the proof, as we'll have both 'P a' (from 'hPa') and '¬P a'.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Use 'byContradiction hNotQ' to start the proof by contradiction.\n2. Apply 'h' to 'a' using 'have hImplication := h a'.\n3. Apply 'hImplication' to 'hNotQ' using 'apply hImplication at hNotQ'.\n4. Finish with 'contradiction' to complete the proof.\n\nEach step should be followed by a period to ensure proper tactic execution in Lean 4.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because the 'byContradiction' tactic is not recognized in Lean 4, indicating a misunderstanding of the available tactics in this version.\n\nImprovement: We should use the 'Classical.byContradiction' tactic instead of 'byContradiction', and ensure all subsequent steps are compatible with Lean 4 syntax and tactics.\n```\n\nThe current approach was on the right track in terms of logical reasoning, but it stumbled due to the use of tactics that are not available or differently named in Lean 4. This highlights the importance of being aware of the specific syntax and tactics available in the version of Lean we're working with.\n\nTo improve in the next steps:\n\n1. We should use 'Classical.byContradiction' instead of 'byContradiction'. This is the correct way to invoke the tactic in Lean 4.\n\n2. We need to double-check that all other tactics we're using are valid in Lean 4. For example, 'have' and 'contradiction' should be fine, but we should be prepared to adjust if we encounter any other incompatibilities.\n\n3. We should consider breaking down complex steps into simpler ones. For instance, instead of applying the implication directly, we might want to use more basic tactics like 'apply' and 'exact' to construct our proof more explicitly.\n\n4. It might be helpful to use the 'sorry' tactic temporarily to skip over difficult parts of the proof and come back to them later. This can help us identify which parts of our proof strategy are working and which need more attention.\n\n5. We should also consider using the 'simp' tactic where appropriate, as it can often simplify goals automatically in Lean 4.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to construct a valid proof in Lean 4 while maintaining the logical structure of our original approach.",
