Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) → (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n   - We need to prove that the left-hand side implies the right-hand side\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a)\n   - Aim to prove: (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n3. Use universal quantification:\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   - Show that P a → Q a holds for this arbitrary 'a'\n\n4. Apply classical logic:\n   - Since the theorem is opened with \"open Classical\", we can use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the negation of what we want to prove: P a ∧ ¬Q a\n\n5. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the hypothesis (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) to our arbitrary 'a'\n   - This gives us: ¬ Q a → ¬ P a\n\n6. Derive a contradiction:\n   - From our assumption, we have ¬Q a, so we can apply modus ponens to get ¬P a\n   - But we also assumed P a, which contradicts ¬P a\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves that our assumption (P a ∧ ¬Q a) must be false\n   - Therefore, P a → Q a must be true for our arbitrary 'a'\n   - Since 'a' was arbitrary, this proves the universal quantification (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n8. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof attempt encountered an error due to the use of 'by_contra', which is not a valid tactic in Lean 4. We need to adjust our approach to use Lean 4 compatible tactics and theorem names. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Replace 'by_contra' with 'Classical.byContradiction' to start the proof by contradiction. This aligns with Lean 4's syntax and the fact that we've opened the Classical namespace.\n\n2. After introducing the contradiction hypothesis, we need to apply the universal quantifier from our assumption 'h' to our specific 'a'. This can be done using the 'specialize' tactic or by direct application.\n\n3. We then need to derive ¬P a from ¬Q a using the specialized hypothesis. This can be done using the 'apply' tactic.\n\n4. Finally, we should have both P a (from hPa) and ¬P a in our context, allowing us to use the 'contradiction' tactic to complete the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps carefully, ensuring each tactic application is valid in Lean 4 and progresses the proof towards its conclusion.\n",
