Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) → (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n   - We need to prove that the left-hand side implies the right-hand side\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a)\n   - Aim to prove: (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n3. Use universal quantification:\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   - Show that P a → Q a holds for this arbitrary 'a'\n\n4. Apply classical logic:\n   - Since the theorem is opened with \"open Classical\", we can use proof by contradiction\n   - Assume the negation of what we want to prove: P a ∧ ¬Q a\n\n5. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the hypothesis (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a) to our arbitrary 'a'\n   - This gives us: ¬ Q a → ¬ P a\n\n6. Derive a contradiction:\n   - From our assumption, we have ¬Q a, so we can apply modus ponens to get ¬P a\n   - But we also assumed P a, which contradicts ¬P a\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves that our assumption (P a ∧ ¬Q a) must be false\n   - Therefore, P a → Q a must be true for our arbitrary 'a'\n   - Since 'a' was arbitrary, this proves the universal quantification (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n\n8. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The proof strategy is sound, but we need to adjust our tactics for Lean 4 compatibility.\n\n2. We should continue with the proof by contradiction approach, but use the correct tactic name 'Classical.byContradiction'.\n\n3. After introducing the contradiction hypothesis, we'll need to apply the universal quantifier from our assumption 'h' to our specific 'a'.\n\n4. Then, we can use modus ponens to derive ¬P a, which will contradict our assumption hPa : P a.\n\n5. We should be prepared to break down complex steps into simpler ones using basic tactics like 'apply' and 'exact' if needed.\n\n6. The goal is to reach a state where we can apply the 'contradiction' tactic to complete the proof.\n\nGiven these considerations, I suggest the following steps for the acting agent:\n\n1. Use 'Classical.byContradiction' to start the proof by contradiction.\n2. Introduce a hypothesis assuming ¬Q a.\n3. Apply the universal quantifier from 'h' to 'a'.\n4. Use modus ponens to derive ¬P a.\n5. Use the 'contradiction' tactic to finalize the proof.\n\nIf any step fails, we should be ready to break it down further or use 'sorry' to temporarily skip it and revisit later.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt used the tactic 'by_contra', which is not recognized in Lean 4, leading to an error in the proof process.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'by_contra' with 'Classical.byContradiction' and adjust the subsequent steps to align with Lean 4 syntax and proof structure.\n```\n\nThe main issue in the current proof attempt is the use of 'by_contra', which is not a valid tactic in Lean 4. This caused the proof to fail at that point. Additionally, the subsequent steps were not executed due to this error.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Use 'Classical.byContradiction' instead of 'by_contra' to start the proof by contradiction.\n2. Ensure that all tactics and theorem names used are compatible with Lean 4.\n3. After introducing the contradiction hypothesis, we need to apply the universal quantifier from our assumption 'h' to our specific 'a' using the correct Lean 4 syntax.\n4. Use 'apply' or 'have' statements to derive the necessary implications and contradictions.\n5. Finish the proof with the 'contradiction' tactic when we have both P a and ¬P a in our context.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should implement these changes, starting with the correct contradiction tactic and proceeding step-by-step to build the proof. If any step is unclear or fails, it should be broken down into smaller, more explicit steps to ensure the proof progresses correctly in Lean 4.",
