    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P ↔ Q, then P → Q.\n   - We need to prove that a bi-implication (↔) implies a single implication (→).\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with `intro h` to introduce the hypothesis (P ↔ Q).\n   - Then use `intro p` to assume P (the antecedent of P → Q).\n\n3. Utilize the bi-implication:\n   - The hypothesis `h : P ↔ Q` can be split into two parts: P → Q and Q → P.\n   - We only need the P → Q direction for this proof.\n   - Use `h.mp` to extract the P → Q implication from the bi-implication.\n\n4. Apply the extracted implication:\n   - Apply the P → Q implication to our assumption P.\n   - This should give us Q, which is what we need to prove.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - The goal should now be satisfied, as we've shown Q from P and (P ↔ Q).\n\n6. Alternative approach (if needed):\n   - If the above steps don't work directly, consider using `cases h with hpq hqp`\n     to split the bi-implication into its two component implications.\n   - Then use `exact hpq p` to prove the goal.\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Ensure that each step in the proof is justified and follows logically.\n   - Check that no unnecessary steps or assumptions were introduced.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the starting point of the proof for the theorem iffImply, our first step should be to set up the proof structure. The planning suggests we start by introducing the hypotheses.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to introduce the given hypothesis (P ↔ Q) into our local context. This will allow us to work with the bi-implication.\n2. After that, we should introduce P as an assumption, as we're proving P → Q under the condition that P ↔ Q.\n3. These introductions will set up our proof environment, allowing us to then work on deriving Q from our assumptions.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the acting agent to start with the `intro` tactic twice:\n1. First, to introduce the bi-implication hypothesis.\n2. Second, to introduce the assumption of P.\n\nThis will align with steps 1 and 2 of our planning strategy and set us up for the core of the proof.\n",
