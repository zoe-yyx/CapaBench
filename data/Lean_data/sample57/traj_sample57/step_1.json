    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P ↔ Q, then P → Q.\n   - We need to prove that a bi-implication (↔) implies a single implication (→).\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with `intro h` to introduce the hypothesis (P ↔ Q).\n   - Then use `intro p` to assume P (the antecedent of P → Q).\n\n3. Utilize the bi-implication:\n   - The hypothesis `h : P ↔ Q` can be split into two parts: P → Q and Q → P.\n   - We only need the P → Q direction for this proof.\n   - Use `h.mp` to extract the P → Q implication from the bi-implication.\n\n4. Apply the extracted implication:\n   - Apply the P → Q implication to our assumption P.\n   - This should give us Q, which is what we need to prove.\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - The goal should now be satisfied, as we've shown Q from P and (P ↔ Q).\n\n6. Alternative approach (if needed):\n   - If the above steps don't work directly, consider using `cases h with hpq hqp`\n     to split the bi-implication into its two component implications.\n   - Then use `exact hpq p` to prove the goal.\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Ensure that each step in the proof is justified and follows logically.\n   - Check that no unnecessary steps or assumptions were introduced.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we have successfully introduced the hypothesis `h : P ↔ Q` and assumed `p : P`. Now, we need to use the bi-implication to prove Q.\n\nThe key step here is to utilize the left-to-right direction of the bi-implication, which is exactly what we need to prove Q from P. In Lean 4, we can extract this direction using the `mp` (modus ponens) field of the bi-implication.\n\nThe reasoning for the next step is:\n\n1. We have `h : P ↔ Q`, which contains both P → Q and Q → P.\n2. We need to extract P → Q from h.\n3. We can do this using `h.mp`, which gives us the P → Q implication.\n4. We also have `p : P`, which is exactly what we need to apply to this implication.\n5. By applying `h.mp` to `p`, we should obtain Q, which is our goal.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to apply `h.mp p`. This should solve the goal by deriving Q from our given P and the extracted P → Q implication.\n",
