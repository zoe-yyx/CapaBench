Plan to prove both directions of the equivalence:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical reasoning (since we have 'open Classical')\n   - Prove P by contradiction\n   - Prove ¬ Q using the assumption and the proven P\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Prove ¬ (P → Q) by contradiction\n   - Use the assumptions P and ¬ Q to derive a contradiction\n\n5. Combine both directions to complete the if and only if proof\n\n6. Utilize Lean 4 tactics such as:\n   - 'constructor' for splitting the ↔ into two implications\n   - 'intro' for introducing assumptions\n   - 'by_contra' for proof by contradiction\n   - 'exact' or 'apply' for using hypotheses\n   - 'cases' for breaking down conjunctions\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nFor the first implication (¬ (P → Q) → P ∧ ¬ Q):\n\n1. Introduce the assumption ¬ (P → Q) using the 'intro' tactic.\n2. To prove P ∧ ¬ Q, we need to prove both P and ¬ Q separately.\n3. For P:\n   - Use 'by_contra' to prove P by contradiction.\n   - Assume ¬ P and derive a contradiction using the initial assumption ¬ (P → Q).\n4. For ¬ Q:\n   - Use 'intro' to assume Q.\n   - Use the proven P and assumed Q to contradict the initial assumption ¬ (P → Q).\n5. Combine P and ¬ Q to form the conjunction P ∧ ¬ Q.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps for the first implication, using appropriate Lean 4 tactics and ensuring proper indentation. This will resolve the current errors and make progress on the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof uses 'by_contra' tactic which is not available in Lean 4, leading to an \"unknown tactic\" error.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'by_contra' with 'Classical.byContradiction' and adjust the proof structure to use Lean 4 syntax and tactics correctly.\n```\n\nThe current attempt at proving the theorem encounters several issues, primarily stemming from the use of tactics and syntax that are not compatible with Lean 4. Here's a more detailed reflection:\n\n1. The use of 'by_contra' is causing an \"unknown tactic\" error. In Lean 4, we should use 'Classical.byContradiction' instead.\n\n2. The proof structure needs adjustment to align with Lean 4's expectations. Each subgoal should be handled separately and more explicitly.\n\n3. The proof for ¬Q is incomplete and needs to be expanded.\n\n4. The second direction of the proof (P ∧ ¬Q → ¬(P → Q)) is currently marked with 'sorry', indicating it's not yet implemented.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. Replace 'by_contra' with 'Classical.byContradiction'.\n2. Break down the proof into smaller, more manageable steps.\n3. Use 'apply' and 'intro' tactics more explicitly to handle each part of the proof.\n4. Complete the proof for ¬Q using the assumption and the proven P.\n5. Implement the second direction of the proof, which is currently missing.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing these changes, ensuring each step is properly justified and aligns with Lean 4's proof style. This should resolve the current errors and make significant progress towards completing the proof.",
