    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an if and only if (↔) statement\n   - Left side: ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Right side: P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n2. Plan to prove both directions of the equivalence:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical reasoning (since we have 'open Classical')\n   - Prove P by contradiction\n   - Prove ¬ Q using the assumption and the proven P\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Prove ¬ (P → Q) by contradiction\n   - Use the assumptions P and ¬ Q to derive a contradiction\n\n5. Combine both directions to complete the if and only if proof\n\n6. Utilize Lean 4 tactics such as:\n   - 'constructor' for splitting the ↔ into two implications\n   - 'intro' for introducing assumptions\n   - 'by_contra' for proof by contradiction\n   - 'exact' or 'apply' for using hypotheses\n   - 'cases' for breaking down conjunctions\n\n7. Remember to use Classical logic tactics when necessary, as the 'Classical' library is open\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. For the forward direction (¬(P → Q) → P ∧ ¬Q):\n   a. We need to prove P and ¬Q separately.\n   b. For P:\n      - Use Classical.byContradiction instead of by_contra\n      - Apply the negation of the implication to derive a contradiction\n   c. For ¬Q:\n      - Use Classical.byContradiction again\n      - Assume Q and derive a contradiction using the negation of the implication\n\n2. For the backward direction (P ∧ ¬Q → ¬(P → Q)):\n   - Introduce the assumption P ∧ ¬Q\n   - Use Classical.byContradiction to prove ¬(P → Q)\n   - Assume P → Q and derive a contradiction using the assumptions P and ¬Q\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps using Lean 4 tactics, ensuring each subgoal is properly addressed. The proof should be structured clearly, with each direction of the bi-implication handled separately and each step justified using appropriate tactics and reasoning.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current proof attempt and the error message, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof fails due to a type mismatch in the right direction of the bi-implication, specifically in handling double negation.\nImprovement: Use double negation elimination (Classical.byContradiction) to convert ¬¬Q to Q in the right direction of the proof.\n```\n\nThe main issue lies in the right direction of the bi-implication (¬(P → Q) → P ∧ ¬Q). In the part where we're trying to prove ¬Q, we've correctly applied Classical.byContradiction, but we're then trying to use the double negation (nq : ¬¬Q) directly as if it were Q.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. In the right direction, after applying Classical.byContradiction and introducing nq : ¬¬Q, we need to use Classical.byContradiction again to eliminate the double negation.\n\n2. The overall structure of the proof is correct, but we need to adjust the handling of double negation in the right direction.\n\n3. The left direction of the proof (P ∧ ¬Q → ¬(P → Q)) is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\n4. We should ensure that we're using Lean 4 syntax and tactics consistently throughout the proof.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on correctly handling the double negation in the right direction of the bi-implication. This should resolve the type mismatch error and complete the proof successfully.",
