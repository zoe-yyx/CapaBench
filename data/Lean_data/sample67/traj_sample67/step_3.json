    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an if and only if (↔) statement\n   - Left side: ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Right side: P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n2. Plan to prove both directions of the equivalence:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical reasoning (since we have 'open Classical')\n   - Prove P by contradiction\n   - Prove ¬ Q using the assumption and the proven P\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Prove ¬ (P → Q) by contradiction\n   - Use the assumptions P and ¬ Q to derive a contradiction\n\n5. Combine both directions to complete the if and only if proof\n\n6. Utilize Lean 4 tactics such as:\n   - 'constructor' for splitting the ↔ into two implications\n   - 'intro' for introducing assumptions\n   - 'by_contra' for proof by contradiction\n   - 'exact' or 'apply' for using hypotheses\n   - 'cases' for breaking down conjunctions\n\n7. Remember to use Classical logic tactics when necessary, as the 'Classical' library is open\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is mostly correct, but we need to focus on the right side of the bi-implication, specifically in the part where we're proving ¬Q. The current error is due to a type mismatch when trying to use ¬¬Q as Q directly. To fix this, we should use Classical.byContradiction again to eliminate the double negation.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Keep the left direction (¬(P → Q) → P ∧ ¬Q) of the proof as it is, since it's correct.\n\n2. For the right direction (¬Q part):\n   - After applying Classical.byContradiction and introducing nq : ¬¬Q, apply Classical.byContradiction again.\n   - This will allow us to assume ¬Q and prove False, which is equivalent to proving Q.\n   - Use the assumptions h : ¬(P → Q) and the newly introduced ¬Q to derive a contradiction.\n\n3. The overall structure using 'constructor' for the bi-implication and 'cases' for breaking down the conjunction in the right direction is correct and should be maintained.\n\n4. Ensure all tactics and syntax are consistent with Lean 4.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on modifying the ¬Q part of the right direction, using double negation elimination properly to resolve the type mismatch and complete the proof.\n",
