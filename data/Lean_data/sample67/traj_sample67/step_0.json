Plan to prove both directions of the equivalence:\n   a. (→) Prove that ¬ (P → Q) implies P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. (←) Prove that P ∧ ¬ Q implies ¬ (P → Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume ¬ (P → Q)\n   - Use classical reasoning (since we have 'open Classical')\n   - Prove P by contradiction\n   - Prove ¬ Q using the assumption and the proven P\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Prove ¬ (P → Q) by contradiction\n   - Use the assumptions P and ¬ Q to derive a contradiction\n\n5. Combine both directions to complete the if and only if proof\n\n6. Utilize Lean 4 tactics such as:\n   - 'constructor' for splitting the ↔ into two implications\n   - 'intro' for introducing assumptions\n   - 'by_contra' for proof by contradiction\n   - 'exact' or 'apply' for using hypotheses\n   - 'cases' for breaking down conjunctions\n\n7. Remember to use Classical logic tactics when necessary, as the 'Classical' library is open\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo start proving the theorem not_imply_iff, we should follow the plan and begin by splitting the equivalence (↔) into two implications. This will allow us to prove both directions separately.\n\nThe first step should be to use the 'constructor' tactic. This tactic is ideal for splitting bi-directional implications (↔) into two separate implications that we can prove individually.\n\nAfter using 'constructor', we'll have two goals to prove:\n1. ¬ (P → Q) → P ∧ ¬ Q\n2. P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P → Q)\n\nWe should focus on proving the first implication initially. To do this, we'll need to:\n1. Introduce the assumption ¬ (P → Q) using the 'intro' tactic.\n2. Use classical reasoning to prove P by contradiction, likely using the 'by_contra' tactic.\n3. Then prove ¬ Q using the assumption and the proven P.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step for the acting agent is to apply the 'constructor' tactic to split the equivalence into two implications.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the tactic sequence is incomplete, leaving both implications unproven.\n\nImprovement: We should focus on proving each implication separately, starting with the first one by introducing the assumption and using classical reasoning techniques.\n```\n\nThe 'constructor' tactic was correctly applied to split the equivalence into two implications. This was a good start, but the proof is incomplete because we haven't provided the tactics to prove each implication.\n\nFor the next steps, we should:\n\n1. Focus on the first implication (¬ (P → Q) → P ∧ ¬ Q):\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the assumption ¬ (P → Q).\n   - Apply 'by_contra' to prove P by contradiction.\n   - Use the assumption and the proven P to show ¬ Q.\n   - Combine these to prove P ∧ ¬ Q.\n\n2. Then move on to the second implication (P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P → Q)):\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the assumption P ∧ ¬ Q.\n   - Apply 'intro' again to negate (P → Q).\n   - Use the assumptions to derive a contradiction.\n\nThe acting agent should start by implementing the tactics for the first implication, ensuring each step is properly indented and separated by tactic separators (like ·) if necessary.\n\nThis approach will address the current errors and move the proof forward systematically.",
