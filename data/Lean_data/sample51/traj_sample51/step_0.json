    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem andComm:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P ∧ Q is true, then Q ∧ P is true.\n   - This is a logical implication (→) that we need to prove.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the assumption that P ∧ Q is true.\n   - Our goal is to prove Q ∧ P.\n\n3. Break down the conjunction:\n   - Since we're assuming P ∧ Q, we can extract both P and Q as separate facts.\n\n4. Construct the new conjunction:\n   - Use the extracted P and Q to form Q ∧ P.\n\n5. Apply Lean 4 tactics:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the assumption P ∧ Q.\n   - Use 'cases' or 'destruct' to break down P ∧ Q into its components.\n   - Use 'constructor' to build the new conjunction Q ∧ P.\n\n6. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed and the theorem is proved.\n\nThis plan leverages the symmetry of the conjunction operator and the ability to deconstruct and reconstruct logical statements in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe theorem andComm (P Q : Prop) : P ∧ Q → Q ∧ P requires us to prove that if P ∧ Q is true, then Q ∧ P is also true. We should start by introducing the assumption P ∧ Q. \n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should use the 'intro' tactic to introduce the assumption P ∧ Q into our local context. This will allow us to work with this assumption to prove our goal.\n\n2. After introducing the assumption, we'll have P ∧ Q as a hypothesis and Q ∧ P as our goal.\n\n3. The 'intro' tactic in Lean 4 is used to introduce hypotheses for implications and universal quantifiers. It's the logical equivalent of saying \"Assume P ∧ Q is true.\"\n\n4. This step aligns with the first part of our proving plan, which is to set up the proof by starting with the assumption that P ∧ Q is true.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the 'intro' tactic as the next proving operation. This will set the stage for the subsequent steps in our proof strategy.\n",
