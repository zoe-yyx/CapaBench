    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem andComm:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P ∧ Q is true, then Q ∧ P is true.\n   - This is a logical implication (→) that we need to prove.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the assumption that P ∧ Q is true.\n   - Our goal is to prove Q ∧ P.\n\n3. Break down the conjunction:\n   - Since we're assuming P ∧ Q, we can extract both P and Q as separate facts.\n\n4. Construct the new conjunction:\n   - Use the extracted P and Q to form Q ∧ P.\n\n5. Apply Lean 4 tactics:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the assumption P ∧ Q.\n   - Use 'cases' or 'destruct' to break down P ∧ Q into its components.\n   - Use 'constructor' to build the new conjunction Q ∧ P.\n\n6. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed and the theorem is proved.\n\nThis plan leverages the symmetry of the conjunction operator and the ability to deconstruct and reconstruct logical statements in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced the hypothesis 'h : P ∧ Q' using the 'intro' tactic. Now, we need to break down this conjunction to access its individual components P and Q. This aligns with step 3 of our plan: \"Break down the conjunction\".\n\nThe most appropriate tactic to use here is 'cases' (or 'destruct' in some versions of Lean). This tactic will split the conjunction 'P ∧ Q' into its constituent parts, giving us separate hypotheses for P and Q.\n\nAfter applying 'cases', we'll have individual assumptions for P and Q, which we can then use to construct our goal 'Q ∧ P'.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in our proof is to apply the 'cases' tactic on our hypothesis 'h'.\n",
