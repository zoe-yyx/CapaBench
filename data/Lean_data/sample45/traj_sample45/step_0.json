    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem logicEx2:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves four propositions: P1, Q1, P2, and Q2\n   - The goal is to prove P2 ∧ Q2 given three premises\n\n2. Identify the premises:\n   a. P1 ∧ Q1\n   b. P1 → P2\n   c. Q1 → Q2\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   1) Start by introducing the premises into the context\n   2) Break down the first premise (P1 ∧ Q1) into its components\n   3) Use the separated P1 and Q1 to apply the second and third premises\n   4) Combine the resulting P2 and Q2 to form the conclusion\n\n4. Outline the tactics to be used:\n   - intro: to bring the premises into the context\n   - cases: to decompose the conjunction P1 ∧ Q1\n   - apply: to use the implications P1 → P2 and Q1 → Q2\n   - constructor: to form the final conjunction P2 ∧ Q2\n\n5. Consider potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of multiple premises\n   - Pay attention to the order of applying tactics\n\n6. Verification step:\n   - After constructing the proof, verify that all premises have been used\n   - Check that the final goal matches the theorem statement\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem logicEx2, guiding the player through the logical steps required to reach the conclusion P2 ∧ Q2 from the given premises.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to introduce the premises into the context. The theorem has three main premises:\n\n1. P1 ∧ Q1\n2. P1 → P2\n3. Q1 → Q2\n\nTo bring these premises into our context, we should use the `intro` tactic. This will allow us to work with these premises in our proof.\n\nAfter introducing the premises, our next logical step would be to break down the first premise (P1 ∧ Q1) into its components. This will give us separate access to P1 and Q1, which we'll need to apply the second and third premises later.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by using the `intro` tactic to bring the premises into the context. This will set up the foundation for the subsequent steps in our proof.\n",
