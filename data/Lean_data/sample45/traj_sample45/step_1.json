    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem logicEx2:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves four propositions: P1, Q1, P2, and Q2\n   - The goal is to prove P2 ∧ Q2 given three premises\n\n2. Identify the premises:\n   a. P1 ∧ Q1\n   b. P1 → P2\n   c. Q1 → Q2\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   1) Start by introducing the premises into the context\n   2) Break down the first premise (P1 ∧ Q1) into its components\n   3) Use the separated P1 and Q1 to apply the second and third premises\n   4) Combine the resulting P2 and Q2 to form the conclusion\n\n4. Outline the tactics to be used:\n   - intro: to bring the premises into the context\n   - cases: to decompose the conjunction P1 ∧ Q1\n   - apply: to use the implications P1 → P2 and Q1 → Q2\n   - constructor: to form the final conjunction P2 ∧ Q2\n\n5. Consider potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of multiple premises\n   - Pay attention to the order of applying tactics\n\n6. Verification step:\n   - After constructing the proof, verify that all premises have been used\n   - Check that the final goal matches the theorem statement\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem logicEx2, guiding the player through the logical steps required to reach the conclusion P2 ∧ Q2 from the given premises.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced the premises into the context using the `intro` tactic. Now, we need to break down the first premise (P1 ∧ Q1) into its components. This will allow us to use P1 and Q1 separately to apply the second and third premises.\n\nThe next logical step is to use the `cases` tactic on `h1` to decompose the conjunction P1 ∧ Q1. This will give us two new hypotheses, one for P1 and one for Q1.\n\nAfter decomposing h1, we'll be able to apply h2 to the P1 hypothesis to get P2, and apply h3 to the Q1 hypothesis to get Q2. Then we can use these results to construct our final goal P2 ∧ Q2.\n\nSo, the reasoning suggests that our next operation should be to use the `cases` tactic on h1.\n",
