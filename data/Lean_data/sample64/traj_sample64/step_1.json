    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem notEx2:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P is true and not P is true, then Q is true.\n   - This is an example of the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\n2. Identify the structure:\n   - We need to prove an implication: P → ¬P → Q\n   - This is a chain of implications, so we'll likely use introduction rules.\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Assume P (introduce the first hypothesis)\n   b. Assume ¬P (introduce the second hypothesis)\n   c. Show that these assumptions lead to a contradiction\n   d. Use the contradiction to prove Q\n\n4. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the contradiction\n   - contradiction: to derive false from P and ¬P\n   - exact: to finish the proof once we have derived false\n\n5. Potential steps:\n   - intro h1 (introduce hypothesis for P)\n   - intro h2 (introduce hypothesis for ¬P)\n   - have h3 := h2 h1 (apply ¬P to P to get false)\n   - exact False.elim h3 (use false to prove Q)\n\n6. Reflection points:\n   - Understand why this theorem holds (principle of explosion)\n   - Recognize the pattern of deriving anything from a contradiction\n   - Consider how this relates to classical logic vs. constructive logic\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem notEx2 in Lean 4, focusing on the logical steps and tactics needed to complete the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced the hypotheses h1 : P and h2 : ¬P. Now, we need to derive a contradiction from these hypotheses and use it to prove Q.\n\nThe next logical step is to apply h2 (which is ¬P) to h1 (which is P). This will give us a contradiction (False), because we're asserting both P and not P at the same time.\n\nOnce we have False, we can use it to prove any proposition, including Q, which is what we need to prove.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to create this contradiction and then use it to finish the proof. We can do this in two steps:\n\n1. Apply h2 to h1 to get False\n2. Use False to prove Q (which can be done in one step using False.elim)\n\nThis reasoning aligns with steps 4c and 4d in our original plan, and it will effectively complete the proof of the theorem.\n",
