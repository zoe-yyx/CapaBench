    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem notEx2:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P is true and not P is true, then Q is true.\n   - This is an example of the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\n2. Identify the structure:\n   - We need to prove an implication: P → ¬P → Q\n   - This is a chain of implications, so we'll likely use introduction rules.\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Assume P (introduce the first hypothesis)\n   b. Assume ¬P (introduce the second hypothesis)\n   c. Show that these assumptions lead to a contradiction\n   d. Use the contradiction to prove Q\n\n4. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the contradiction\n   - contradiction: to derive false from P and ¬P\n   - exact: to finish the proof once we have derived false\n\n5. Potential steps:\n   - intro h1 (introduce hypothesis for P)\n   - intro h2 (introduce hypothesis for ¬P)\n   - have h3 := h2 h1 (apply ¬P to P to get false)\n   - exact False.elim h3 (use false to prove Q)\n\n6. Reflection points:\n   - Understand why this theorem holds (principle of explosion)\n   - Recognize the pattern of deriving anything from a contradiction\n   - Consider how this relates to classical logic vs. constructive logic\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem notEx2 in Lean 4, focusing on the logical steps and tactics needed to complete the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for theorem notEx2, our first step should be to introduce the hypotheses. The theorem statement involves two implications, so we need to introduce two assumptions.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We should start by introducing the first hypothesis, which is P.\n2. Then, we should introduce the second hypothesis, which is ¬P.\n3. After introducing these hypotheses, we'll have the necessary components to derive a contradiction.\n\nThe acting agent should use the 'intro' tactic twice to bring these assumptions into our local context. This will set the stage for the next steps of the proof, where we'll use these assumptions to derive a contradiction and ultimately prove Q.\n\nSuggested next action:\nUse the 'intro' tactic twice to introduce hypotheses for P and ¬P. This can be done in a single line of Lean code.\n",
