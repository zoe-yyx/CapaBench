    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that for any natural number n, multiplying n by zero results in zero.\n   - The theorem uses the `mul` function defined earlier.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Use induction on n, as the `mul` function is defined recursively.\n\n3. Base case:\n   - Prove the theorem for n = 0 (zero).\n   - Use the definition of `mul` for zero as the first argument.\n\n4. Inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some k (induction hypothesis).\n   - Prove the theorem for k + 1 (succ k).\n   - Use the definition of `mul` for succ as the first argument.\n   - Use the induction hypothesis and the definition of `add`.\n\n5. Apply simplification and rewriting:\n   - Simplify expressions using the definitions of `mul` and `add`.\n   - Use rewriting tactics to replace expressions with equivalent forms.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that both the base case and inductive step are proven.\n   - This completes the proof by induction.\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Be careful with the order of arguments in `mul` and `add`.\n   - Ensure proper use of parentheses when expanding definitions.\n\n8. Tactics to consider:\n   - induction\n   - rfl (for reflexivity)\n   - simp (for simplification)\n   - rw (for rewriting)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mulZeroR, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with induction on n:\n   The mul function is defined recursively, so induction is a natural approach. This will allow us to prove the theorem for all natural numbers.\n\n2. For the base case (n = 0):\n   We need to show that mul 0 0 = 0. This should follow directly from the definition of mul for zero as the first argument.\n\n3. For the inductive step:\n   We assume the theorem holds for some k (induction hypothesis) and prove it for k + 1 (succ k).\n   We'll need to use the definition of mul for succ as the first argument and then simplify using the definition of add.\n\n4. Use simplification and rewriting:\n   After expanding the definitions, we'll likely need to simplify the expressions and possibly rewrite some terms to match our goal.\n\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof, the acting agent should start by applying the induction tactic on n. This will set up both the base case and the inductive step, allowing us to tackle each part of the proof systematically.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete due to the use of 'sorry' in the inductive step, leaving the crucial part of the proof unfinished.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'sorry' with a detailed proof for the inductive step, utilizing the induction hypothesis and the definitions of mul and add to show that mul (succ n) zero = zero.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is correct, with the induction on n set up properly. The base case (n = zero) is correctly proven using reflexivity (rfl). However, the inductive step is left unproven with 'sorry'.\n\nTo improve, we need to focus on completing the inductive step. Here's a more detailed strategy:\n\n1. Expand the definition of mul for succ n: \n   mul (succ n) zero = add zero (mul n zero)\n\n2. Use the induction hypothesis (ih) to replace (mul n zero) with zero:\n   add zero (mul n zero) = add zero zero\n\n3. Simplify add zero zero to zero using the definition of add.\n\n4. These steps should lead to the conclusion that mul (succ n) zero = zero, completing the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps, replacing 'sorry' with the actual proof. This will require using tactics like 'rw' (rewrite) to apply definitions and the induction hypothesis, and possibly 'simp' for simplification.",
