    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that for any natural number n, multiplying n by zero results in zero.\n   - The theorem uses the `mul` function defined earlier.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Use induction on n, as the `mul` function is defined recursively.\n\n3. Base case:\n   - Prove the theorem for n = 0 (zero).\n   - Use the definition of `mul` for zero as the first argument.\n\n4. Inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some k (induction hypothesis).\n   - Prove the theorem for k + 1 (succ k).\n   - Use the definition of `mul` for succ as the first argument.\n   - Use the induction hypothesis and the definition of `add`.\n\n5. Apply simplification and rewriting:\n   - Simplify expressions using the definitions of `mul` and `add`.\n   - Use rewriting tactics to replace expressions with equivalent forms.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that both the base case and inductive step are proven.\n   - This completes the proof by induction.\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Be careful with the order of arguments in `mul` and `add`.\n   - Ensure proper use of parentheses when expanding definitions.\n\n8. Tactics to consider:\n   - induction\n   - rfl (for reflexivity)\n   - simp (for simplification)\n   - rw (for rewriting)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the inductive step, we need to prove that mul (succ n) zero = zero, given the induction hypothesis ih: mul n zero = zero. Let's break this down into steps:\n\n1. First, expand the definition of mul for succ n:\n   mul (succ n) zero = add zero (mul n zero)\n   \n   We can do this by rewriting with the definition of mul.\n\n2. Next, use the induction hypothesis to replace (mul n zero) with zero:\n   add zero (mul n zero) = add zero zero\n   \n   This can be done by rewriting with the induction hypothesis.\n\n3. Finally, simplify add zero zero to zero:\n   add zero zero = zero\n   \n   This follows directly from the definition of add.\n\nBy chaining these steps together, we can prove that mul (succ n) zero = zero, which completes the inductive step.\n\nThe acting agent should use tactics like 'rw' to perform these rewrites and 'simp' or the definition of add to simplify the final step. The proof should flow logically from the definition of mul, through the induction hypothesis, to the final equality.\n",
