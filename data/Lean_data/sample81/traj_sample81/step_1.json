    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an implication: P ∨ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∨ Q) ∨ R\n   - We need to prove that the left side implies the right side\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypothesis\n   - Name the hypothesis for easy reference (e.g., `h`)\n\n3. Plan the main proof strategy:\n   - Use case analysis on the hypothesis `h` since it's a disjunction\n   - This will give us two cases to consider:\n     a) P is true\n     b) Q ∨ R is true\n\n4. For case a (P is true):\n   - Show that this directly implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R\n   - Use `left` tactic to choose the left side of the main disjunction\n   - Then use `left` again to choose P in P ∨ Q\n\n5. For case b (Q ∨ R is true):\n   - Perform another case analysis on Q ∨ R\n   - This gives two sub-cases:\n     i)  Q is true\n     ii) R is true\n\n6. For sub-case i (Q is true):\n   - Show that this implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R\n   - Use `left` tactic to choose the left side of the main disjunction\n   - Then use `right` to choose Q in P ∨ Q\n\n7. For sub-case ii (R is true):\n   - Show that this directly implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R\n   - Use `right` tactic to choose the right side of the main disjunction\n\n8. Conclude the proof:\n   - All cases should be covered, completing the proof by cases\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we are now at step 3 of our plan: using case analysis on the hypothesis `h`. The hypothesis `h` is a disjunction (P ∨ (Q ∨ R)), so we need to consider two cases:\n\n1. P is true\n2. Q ∨ R is true\n\nTo implement this case analysis in Lean 4, we should use the `cases` tactic on the hypothesis `h`. This will split our proof into two branches, each corresponding to one of the cases mentioned above.\n\nThe reasoning for the next step is:\n\n1. Use the `cases` tactic on `h` to perform the case analysis.\n2. This will generate two new goals, one for each case.\n3. We'll need to prove the conclusion ((P ∨ Q) ∨ R) in both cases.\n4. After applying `cases`, we'll be ready to handle each case separately according to our plan (steps 4 and 5).\n\nThis step will set us up for the subsequent parts of the proof where we'll deal with each case individually.\n",
