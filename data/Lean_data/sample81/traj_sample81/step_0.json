Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypothesis\n   - Name the hypothesis for easy reference (e.g., `h`)\n\n3. Plan the main proof strategy:\n   - Use case analysis on the hypothesis `h` since it's a disjunction\n   - This will give us two cases to consider:\n     a) P is true\n     b) Q ∨ R is true\n\n4. For case a (P is true):\n   - Show that this directly implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R\n   - Use `left` tactic to choose the left side of the main disjunction\n   - Then use `left` again to choose P in P ∨ Q\n\n5. For case b (Q ∨ R is true):\n   - Perform another case analysis on Q ∨ R\n   - This gives two sub-cases:\n     i)  Q is true\n     ii) R is true\n\n6. For sub-case i (Q is true):\n   - Show that this implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R\n   - Use `left` tactic to choose the left side of the main disjunction\n   - Then use `right` to choose Q in P ∨ Q\n\n7. For sub-case ii (R is true):\n   - Show that this directly implies (P ∨ Q) ∨ R\n   - Use `right` tactic to choose the right side of the main disjunction\n\n8. Conclude the proof:\n   - All cases should be covered, completing the proof by cases\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof for the theorem orAssoc1, our first step should be to set up the proof structure according to the planning strategy. The theorem is an implication, so we need to introduce the hypothesis.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n1. We should use the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypothesis of the implication.\n2. It's good practice to name this hypothesis for easy reference later in the proof.\n3. Since the left side of the implication is P ∨ (Q ∨ R), we can name the hypothesis \"h\" for simplicity.\n\nThis step will allow us to work with the hypothesis and set up the structure for the case analysis that follows. After this, we'll be ready to proceed with the case analysis on the disjunction P ∨ (Q ∨ R).\n",
