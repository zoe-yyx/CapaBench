Understand the logical structure:\n   - We need to show that if B is true, then A ∨ B is true\n   - This is a direct application of the right introduction rule for disjunction\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with an arbitrary assumption of B\n   b. Use the right introduction rule for disjunction to prove A ∨ B\n   c. This can be done by directly providing B as evidence for the right-hand side of the disjunction\n\n4. Consider Lean 4 tactics:\n   - intro: to introduce the assumption B\n   - apply Or.inr: to apply the right introduction rule for disjunction\n\n5. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use intro to bring B into the context\n   - Apply Or.inr to prove A ∨ B by providing B\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct syntax for Lean 4 (as opposed to Lean 3)\n   - Be aware of any differences in tactic names or applications in Lean 4\n\n7. Reflect on the simplicity of the proof:\n   - This theorem has a straightforward proof that directly follows from the definition of disjunction\n   - No complex reasoning or additional lemmas should be required\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe theorem `orIntror` is a straightforward application of the right introduction rule for disjunction. We need to prove that given B, we can conclude A ∨ B. The proof structure should be simple and direct:\n\n1. First, we should introduce the assumption B into our context. This will allow us to use B in our proof.\n\n2. Then, we need to prove A ∨ B. Since we have B, we can use the right introduction rule for disjunction (Or.inr) to prove this.\n\n3. The Or.inr constructor takes B as an argument and constructs a proof of A ∨ B by showing that the right-hand side (B) holds.\n\nGiven that we are using Lean 4, we should be aware of potential syntax differences from Lean 3. However, for this simple proof, the tactics should be straightforward:\n\n- Use `intro` to bring B into the context\n- Use `apply Or.inr` to prove A ∨ B by providing B\n\nThis approach directly follows our planning strategy and should lead to a concise and clear proof of the theorem.\n",
