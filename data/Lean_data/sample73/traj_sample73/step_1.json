Identify the given hypotheses:\n   - H1: (∀ a : A, P a → Q a)\n   - H2: (∀ a : A, P a)\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the universal quantifier:\n      - Use 'intro a' to introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A\n   \n   b. Apply the first hypothesis (H1):\n      - Use 'apply' or 'have' to utilize (P a → Q a)\n   \n   c. Prove P a:\n      - Use the second hypothesis (H2) to show that P holds for any a\n   \n   d. Conclude Q a:\n      - The implication from step b and the proof of P a from step c should allow us to conclude Q a\n\n4. Consider using tactics:\n   - 'intro' for introducing variables and hypotheses\n   - 'apply' for applying hypotheses or theorems\n   - 'exact' for providing direct proofs\n   - 'have' for creating intermediate steps if needed\n\n5. Reflect on the logical flow:\n   - This proof demonstrates how universal quantifiers and implications work together\n   - It shows how we can derive a new universal statement from two given universal statements\n\n6. Prepare for potential challenges:\n   - Be ready to unfold definitions if P or Q are defined functions\n   - Consider using 'simp' or other simplification tactics if the expressions become complex\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe 'intro a' command was used correctly to introduce the first hypothesis, but it introduced it with an unexpected name. Instead of introducing an element of type A, it introduced the first implication as a hypothesis named 'a'. This is not what we intended.\n\nTo correct this and proceed with the proof, we need to:\n\n1. Introduce the two implications as separate hypotheses.\n2. Then introduce an arbitrary element of type A.\n3. Apply the hypotheses to prove the goal for this arbitrary element.\n\nSo, the next steps should be:\n\n1. Use 'intro h1' to introduce the first implication (∀ a : A, P a → Q a) as a hypothesis.\n2. Use 'intro h2' to introduce the second implication (∀ a : A, P a) as another hypothesis.\n3. Use 'intro a' to introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A.\n\nAfter these steps, we'll be in a position to apply the hypotheses to prove Q a for the arbitrary 'a'.\n",
