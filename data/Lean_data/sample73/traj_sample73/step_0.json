    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem logicEx5, we should follow the planned steps, starting with introducing the universal quantifier. The first step in our proof should be to introduce an arbitrary element of type A, as this will allow us to work with the universal quantifiers in our hypotheses and goal.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to prove a universally quantified statement (∀ a : A, Q a).\n2. The standard approach for proving such statements is to consider an arbitrary element of the domain.\n3. In Lean 4, we can use the 'intro' tactic to introduce this arbitrary element.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in our proof should be to use the 'intro' tactic to introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A. This will set up our proof environment to work with the specific instance of our universal statements.\n\nAfter this step, we'll be in a position to apply our hypotheses to this specific 'a', which will lead us towards proving Q a for this arbitrary a, and thus proving the theorem for all a in A.\n",
