    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem \"One_plus_one\".\n   - We need to show that plus_one 1 = 2.\n   - The function plus_one is defined as (x : ℤ) : ℤ := x + 1.\n\n2. Plan the proof steps:\n   a) Unfold the definition of plus_one.\n   b) Simplify the resulting expression.\n   c) Verify that the simplified expression equals 2.\n\n3. Tactics to consider:\n   - rfl: For reflexivity, if the equality is true by definition.\n   - simp: To simplify expressions and perform basic rewrites.\n   - norm_num: To normalize numerical expressions.\n   - linarith: If more complex integer arithmetic is needed (though likely not necessary for this simple case).\n\n4. Execution strategy:\n   - Start by unfolding the definition of plus_one.\n   - The proof should be straightforward and likely solvable in one or two tactics.\n   - If the proof doesn't complete immediately, consider using step-by-step tactics to understand the intermediate states.\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure that the final proof shows plus_one 1 = 2.\n   - Check that no assumptions or additional hypotheses are introduced.\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - The proof should be very straightforward, but if issues arise, consider checking:\n     a) The exact definition of plus_one.\n     b) Any implicit coercions between natural numbers and integers.\n\n7. Learning opportunity:\n   - This problem demonstrates basic function application and arithmetic in Lean 4.\n   - It's a good opportunity to understand how Lean handles simple integer arithmetic and function definitions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following our planned strategy. The first step is to unfold the definition of plus_one.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem statement \"One_plus_one : plus_one 1 = 2\" involves the function plus_one applied to the argument 1.\n2. We need to expand this function application to reveal its internal structure.\n3. The definition of plus_one is (x : ℤ) : ℤ := x + 1, so we expect plus_one 1 to unfold to 1 + 1.\n4. After unfolding, the goal should become equivalent to proving 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to unfold the definition of plus_one. This will allow us to work directly with the arithmetic expression and prove the equality.\n\nThe acting agent should use a tactic that unfolds definitions or simplifies function applications. The `simp` tactic is a good choice for this, as it can both unfold definitions and perform basic simplifications.\n",
