    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that if the reverse of a tree is a leaf, then the original tree is also a leaf.\n   - The theorem involves the `treeReverse` function and the `Tree` inductive type.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Use induction on the tree structure `t`.\n   - Consider two cases: when `t` is a leaf and when `t` is a node.\n\n3. Case 1: Leaf case\n   - Show that when `t` is a leaf, the theorem holds trivially.\n   - Use the definition of `treeReverse` for the leaf case.\n\n4. Case 2: Node case\n   - Assume `t` is a node with left subtree `l`, value `v`, and right subtree `r`.\n   - Apply the definition of `treeReverse` for the node case.\n   - Show that `treeReverse (node l v r) = leaf` leads to a contradiction.\n\n5. Contradiction in Node case:\n   - Expand `treeReverse (node l v r)` using its definition.\n   - Show that `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l) ≠ leaf` for any `l`, `v`, and `r`.\n   - Use the fact that `node` and `leaf` are distinct constructors of `Tree`.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Since the leaf case holds and the node case leads to a contradiction,\n     we can conclude that if `treeReverse t = leaf`, then `t` must be a leaf.\n\n7. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the logic is sound.\n   - Check that the proof aligns with Lean 4's syntax and tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure is almost correct, but we need to make a small adjustment to complete it properly. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. The case split using 'cases t with' is correct and should be kept.\n\n2. For the 'leaf' case, the current proof using 'rfl' is perfect and doesn't need any changes.\n\n3. In the 'node' case, we're on the right track. The 'simp [treeReverse] at h' tactic is doing the heavy lifting for us. It's simplifying the hypothesis 'h' using the definition of 'treeReverse'.\n\n4. After the simplification, Lean is able to automatically detect the contradiction between the simplified hypothesis and the goal. This is why there are no more goals to solve after this step.\n\n5. The 'contradiction' tactic at the end is unnecessary and should be removed.\n\n6. To properly finish the proof, we should end the 'node' case right after the 'simp' tactic.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should modify the proof by removing the 'contradiction' line and ensuring that the proof structure is complete after the 'simp' tactic in the 'node' case. This should resolve the \"no goals to be solved\" error and complete the proof successfully.\n",
