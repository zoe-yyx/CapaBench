    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that if the reverse of a tree is a leaf, then the original tree is also a leaf.\n   - The theorem involves the `treeReverse` function and the `Tree` inductive type.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Use induction on the tree structure `t`.\n   - Consider two cases: when `t` is a leaf and when `t` is a node.\n\n3. Case 1: Leaf case\n   - Show that when `t` is a leaf, the theorem holds trivially.\n   - Use the definition of `treeReverse` for the leaf case.\n\n4. Case 2: Node case\n   - Assume `t` is a node with left subtree `l`, value `v`, and right subtree `r`.\n   - Apply the definition of `treeReverse` for the node case.\n   - Show that `treeReverse (node l v r) = leaf` leads to a contradiction.\n\n5. Contradiction in Node case:\n   - Expand `treeReverse (node l v r)` using its definition.\n   - Show that `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l) ≠ leaf` for any `l`, `v`, and `r`.\n   - Use the fact that `node` and `leaf` are distinct constructors of `Tree`.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Since the leaf case holds and the node case leads to a contradiction,\n     we can conclude that if `treeReverse t = leaf`, then `t` must be a leaf.\n\n7. Finalize:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered and the logic is sound.\n   - Check that the proof aligns with Lean 4's syntax and tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem `reverseResultLeaf`, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypothesis that `treeReverse t = leaf`.\n\n2. Use the `cases` tactic on `t` to consider the two possible cases of the `Tree` structure: `leaf` and `node`.\n\n3. For the `leaf` case:\n   - This case should be trivial, as `treeReverse leaf = leaf` by definition.\n   - Use the `rfl` tactic to prove this case.\n\n4. For the `node` case:\n   - We need to show that this case leads to a contradiction.\n   - First, expand the definition of `treeReverse` for a node.\n   - Then, we can use the fact that `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l)` cannot be equal to `leaf`.\n   - This contradiction can be shown using the `contradiction` tactic or by applying the fact that `node` and `leaf` are distinct constructors.\n\n5. Once both cases are handled, the proof should be complete.\n\nThe acting agent should start by applying the `intro` tactic to begin the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt fails because after simplifying `treeReverse` in the `node` case, we're left with an equality that doesn't immediately lead to a contradiction.\n\nImprovement: Instead of using `cases h` after simplification, we should directly use the contradiction tactic to show that `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l) = leaf` is impossible.\n```\n\nThe current approach was on the right track, but it fell short in the final step of the `node` case. After simplifying `treeReverse` in the hypothesis, we're left with an equality that states a `node` structure is equal to `leaf`, which is a contradiction. However, the proof doesn't explicitly handle this contradiction.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Keep the initial steps of introducing the hypothesis and pattern matching on `t`.\n2. In the `leaf` case, continue using `rfl` as it's correct.\n3. In the `node` case, after simplifying `treeReverse`, we should directly use the `contradiction` tactic. This tactic will recognize that `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l) = leaf` is impossible because `node` and `leaf` are distinct constructors of the `Tree` type.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we can complete the proof without leaving any unresolved goals. The acting agent should implement these changes in the next iteration of the proof.",
