Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named \"iffRefl\"\n   - It states that for any proposition P, P is equivalent to itself (P ↔ P)\n   - The theorem uses the iff (↔) connective, which means \"if and only if\"\n\n2. Understand the goal:\n   - We need to prove that P ↔ P for any arbitrary proposition P\n\n3. Break down the iff statement:\n   - Remember that P ↔ Q is equivalent to (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)\n   - In this case, we need to prove (P → P) ∧ (P → P)\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the goal into two implications\n   - This will give us two subgoals: P → P and P → P\n\n5. Prove the implications:\n   - For each subgoal (P → P), use the `intro` tactic to assume P\n   - Then use the `exact` tactic with the assumption to prove P\n\n6. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof is complete\n\n7. Optional optimization:\n   - Consider if there's a more concise way to write the proof, such as using `rfl` for reflexivity\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're starting with a blank slate for the theorem iffRefl, our first step should be to set up the basic structure of the proof. The planning strategy suggests using `apply Iff.intro` to split the goal into two implications. This is a good starting point as it directly addresses the nature of the iff (↔) connective.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n1. The theorem statement P ↔ P is an iff statement, which can be broken down into two implications: (P → P) and (P → P).\n2. The `Iff.intro` tactic is specifically designed to handle such iff statements by splitting them into these two implications.\n3. Using this tactic will give us a clear structure for the rest of the proof, aligning with steps 3 and 4 of our plan.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent start the proof by applying the `Iff.intro` tactic. This will set up two subgoals, both of which will be P → P, preparing us for the next steps in the proof process.\n",
