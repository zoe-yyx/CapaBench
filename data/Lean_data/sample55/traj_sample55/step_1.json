Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named \"iffRefl\"\n   - It states that for any proposition P, P is equivalent to itself (P ↔ P)\n   - The theorem uses the iff (↔) connective, which means \"if and only if\"\n\n2. Understand the goal:\n   - We need to prove that P ↔ P for any arbitrary proposition P\n\n3. Break down the iff statement:\n   - Remember that P ↔ Q is equivalent to (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)\n   - In this case, we need to prove (P → P) ∧ (P → P)\n\n4. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the goal into two implications\n   - This will give us two subgoals: P → P and P → P\n\n5. Prove the implications:\n   - For each subgoal (P → P), use the `intro` tactic to assume P\n   - Then use the `exact` tactic with the assumption to prove P\n\n6. Verify the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof is complete\n\n7. Optional optimization:\n   - Consider if there's a more concise way to write the proof, such as using `rfl` for reflexivity\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and the planning strategy, we have successfully applied the `Iff.intro` tactic, which has split our goal into two subgoals: P → P for both the \"mp\" (modus ponens) and \"mpr\" (modus ponens reverse) cases. This aligns with step 4 of our plan.\n\nNow, we need to proceed with step 5 of our plan, which is to prove these implications. For each subgoal (P → P), we should:\n\n1. Use the `intro` tactic to assume P. This will bring the antecedent of the implication into our context as a hypothesis.\n2. Use the `exact` tactic with the assumption to prove P.\n\nSince both subgoals are identical (P → P), we can use the same approach for both. The acting agent should apply these steps to each subgoal separately.\n\nTo guide the acting agent, we should suggest using the following tactics for each subgoal:\n\n1. `intro h` - This introduces the hypothesis P and names it 'h'.\n2. `exact h` - This proves the goal using the hypothesis 'h'.\n\nAfter applying these tactics to both subgoals, the proof should be complete, satisfying step 6 of our plan.\n",
