Understand the given definitions:\n   - mono: A function is monotonic if f(n) ≤ f(m) whenever n ≤ m.\n   - shift_up1: Shifts a function up by 1, i.e., (shift_up1 f)(x) = f(x) + 1.\n   - preserved_by_shifting_up: A property P is preserved by shifting up if P(f) implies P(shift_up1 f).\n\n2. Outline the proof structure:\n   a. Start by introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses.\n   b. Prove that if f is monotonic, then shift_up1 f is also monotonic.\n\n3. Detailed proof steps:\n   a. Introduce variables:\n      - Let f be an arbitrary function from ℤ to ℤ.\n      - Assume that f is monotonic (i.e., mono f is true).\n      - Let n and m be arbitrary integers such that n ≤ m.\n\n   b. Show that (shift_up1 f) n ≤ (shift_up1 f) m:\n      - Expand the definition of shift_up1: \n        (shift_up1 f) n = f n + 1 and (shift_up1 f) m = f m + 1\n      - Use the monotonicity of f: f n ≤ f m (because n ≤ m)\n      - Show that adding 1 to both sides preserves the inequality:\n        f n + 1 ≤ f m + 1\n\n   c. Conclude that shift_up1 f is monotonic.\n\n4. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro: To introduce variables and hypotheses.\n   - unfold: To expand definitions like mono, shift_up1, and preserved_by_shifting_up.\n   - apply: To apply the monotonicity property of f.\n   - linarith: To handle simple linear inequalities.\n\n5. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates that shifting a monotonic function up by a constant preserves its monotonicity.\n   - The key insight is that adding a constant to both sides of an inequality doesn't change the inequality.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem `mono_pu`, we need to show that monotonicity is preserved by shifting a function up by 1. Let's start by breaking down the proof into manageable steps:\n\n1. First, we need to unfold the definition of `preserved_by_shifting_up` and `mono`. This will give us the structure of what we need to prove.\n\n2. We should introduce the necessary variables and hypotheses:\n   - Introduce a function `f : ℤ → ℤ`\n   - Assume that `f` is monotonic (i.e., `mono f` is true)\n   - Introduce two arbitrary integers `n` and `m`\n   - Assume that `n ≤ m`\n\n3. Our goal will be to prove that `(shift_up1 f) n ≤ (shift_up1 f) m`. To do this:\n   - Unfold the definition of `shift_up1`\n   - Use the monotonicity of `f` to show that `f n ≤ f m`\n   - Show that adding 1 to both sides preserves the inequality\n\n4. The proof will likely involve the following steps:\n   - Use `intro` to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - Use `unfold` to expand definitions\n   - Apply the monotonicity of `f`\n   - Use `linarith` to handle the arithmetic inequalities\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by unfolding the definitions and introducing the necessary variables and hypotheses. This will set up the proof structure and allow us to work towards showing that `shift_up1 f` is monotonic when `f` is monotonic.\n",
