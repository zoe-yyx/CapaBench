Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_left1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_left1' applies a function to (x + 1)\n\n2. Expand the left-hand side:\n   - Start with shift_left1 plus_one x\n   - Apply the definition of shift_left1\n   - This should result in plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Apply the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one (x + 1) according to its definition\n   - This should give (x + 1) + 1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Rearrange (x + 1) + 1 to x + (1 + 1)\n   - Simplify 1 + 1 to 2\n   - Obtain the final form x + 2\n\n5. Compare with the right-hand side:\n   - Verify that the simplified left-hand side matches the right-hand side (x + 2)\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - Consider using 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply definitions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification steps\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplification\n\n7.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, our first step should be to expand the definitions of the functions involved in the theorem. This aligns with steps 1 and 2 of our planning strategy.\n\nWe should start by focusing on the left-hand side of the equation: shift_left1 plus_one x\n\n1. First, we need to expand the definition of shift_left1. According to the definition, shift_left1 f x = f (x + 1). In our case, f is plus_one.\n\n2. After expanding shift_left1, we'll have: plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Next, we should expand the definition of plus_one. The definition states that plus_one x = x + 1.\n\n4. Applying this to our current expression, we get: (x + 1) + 1\n\nThese expansions will set us up for the simplification steps that follow. The acting agent should focus on using the 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply these definitions in order. This will transform the left-hand side of the equation into a form that can be easily simplified to match the right-hand side.\n\nThe next proving operation should thus be to use the 'rw' tactic to expand these definitions in the order described above.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof steps were correct up to the expansion of definitions, but the final simplification step using 'simp' failed to make progress.\n\nImprovement: Instead of using 'simp', we should use 'ring' tactic to simplify and prove the arithmetic equality x + 1 + 1 = x + 2.\n```\n\nThe reflection identifies that the initial steps of expanding the definitions were correct and successful. The flaw occurred in the final step where 'simp' was unable to simplify the arithmetic expression.\n\nTo improve, we should replace 'simp' with the 'ring' tactic. The 'ring' tactic is specifically designed to handle algebraic expressions and equalities, which is exactly what we need in this case. It can automatically prove equalities in commutative rings, which includes integer arithmetic.\n\nFor future actions, we should consider:\n1. Using more specific tactics when dealing with algebraic expressions.\n2. When simplification is needed for arithmetic expressions, 'ring' or 'linarith' are often more powerful than 'simp'.\n3. Always check the state of the proof after each tactic application to ensure progress is being made.\n\nThese considerations will help guide the planning and acting agents towards more effective proof strategies in similar situations.",
