    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem shift_left1_plus_one:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_left1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_left1' applies a function to (x + 1)\n\n2. Expand the left-hand side:\n   - Start with shift_left1 plus_one x\n   - Apply the definition of shift_left1\n   - This should result in plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Apply the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one (x + 1) according to its definition\n   - This should give (x + 1) + 1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Rearrange (x + 1) + 1 to x + (1 + 1)\n   - Simplify 1 + 1 to 2\n   - Obtain the final form x + 2\n\n5. Compare with the right-hand side:\n   - Verify that the simplified left-hand side matches the right-hand side (x + 2)\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - Consider using 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply definitions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification steps\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplification\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the left-hand side has been transformed to match the right-hand side exactly\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, simplifying expressions, and comparing the results to the desired outcome.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, but we need to make a small adjustment in the final step. Let's analyze the current state:\n\n1. We have successfully expanded the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'plus_one'.\n2. The current goal is to prove: x + 1 + 1 = x + 2\n\nThis is a simple arithmetic equality that can be easily proven using the 'ring' tactic. The 'ring' tactic is specifically designed for such algebraic simplifications and equalities.\n\nTherefore, our next step should be to replace the 'simp' tactic with 'ring'. This should complete the proof by automatically simplifying and proving the arithmetic equality.\n\nIf for any reason 'ring' doesn't work (which is unlikely in this case), we could alternatively use 'linarith', which is another powerful tactic for linear arithmetic.\n\nAfter applying 'ring', the proof should be complete, as it will have shown that the left-hand side of our theorem (shift_left1 plus_one x) is indeed equal to the right-hand side (x + 2).\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The 'ring' tactic is not recognized in Lean 4, causing the proof to fail.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'ring' tactic with 'simp' or a combination of 'rw' and 'linarith' to complete the proof in Lean 4.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that the main issue in the current proof attempt is the use of the 'ring' tactic, which is not available or recognized in Lean 4. This is a common mistake when transitioning from Lean 3 to Lean 4, as some tactics have changed or been replaced.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should consider using tactics that are available and effective in Lean 4 for arithmetic simplifications. The 'simp' tactic is a good general-purpose simplification tactic that can handle many arithmetic equalities. Alternatively, we could use a combination of 'rw' (rewrite) to unfold definitions and 'linarith' to solve linear arithmetic goals.\n\nFor the next steps, I suggest trying the following approach:\n1. Keep the existing 'rw' steps to unfold the definitions.\n2. Replace 'ring' with 'simp' to simplify the arithmetic expression.\n3. If 'simp' alone doesn't solve the goal, follow it with 'linarith' to handle the linear arithmetic.\n\nThis approach should effectively prove the theorem while using tactics that are compatible with Lean 4. It's important to remember that when working with Lean 4, we need to be aware of the available tactics and their syntax, which may differ from Lean 3.",
