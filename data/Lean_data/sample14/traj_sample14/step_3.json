    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem shift_left1_plus_one:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_left1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_left1' applies a function to (x + 1)\n\n2. Expand the left-hand side:\n   - Start with shift_left1 plus_one x\n   - Apply the definition of shift_left1\n   - This should result in plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Apply the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one (x + 1) according to its definition\n   - This should give (x + 1) + 1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Rearrange (x + 1) + 1 to x + (1 + 1)\n   - Simplify 1 + 1 to 2\n   - Obtain the final form x + 2\n\n5. Compare with the right-hand side:\n   - Verify that the simplified left-hand side matches the right-hand side (x + 2)\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - Consider using 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply definitions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification steps\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplification\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the left-hand side has been transformed to match the right-hand side exactly\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, simplifying expressions, and comparing the results to the desired outcome.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof has successfully expanded the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'plus_one', reducing the goal to the arithmetic equality x + 1 + 1 = x + 2. However, the 'simp' tactic was unable to make progress on this goal.\n\nFor this type of simple arithmetic equality in Lean 4, we have two strong options:\n\n1. Use the 'rfl' tactic: This tactic proves goals that are syntactically equal up to computation. In this case, x + 1 + 1 and x + 2 are computationally equivalent, so 'rfl' should be able to prove this automatically.\n\n2. Use the 'norm_num' tactic: This tactic is specifically designed for normalizing and proving numerical expressions. It should easily handle the arithmetic simplification required here.\n\nEither of these tactics should be sufficient to complete the proof. The 'linarith' tactic, while powerful for linear arithmetic, is not necessary for this simple equality and can be removed.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to replace the 'simp' and 'linarith' lines with either 'rfl' or 'norm_num'. This adjustment should successfully conclude the proof in a concise and idiomatic manner for Lean 4.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The 'rfl' tactic failed because x + 1 + 1 and x + 2 are not definitionally equal in Lean 4, despite being mathematically equivalent.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'rfl' with 'ring', a tactic specifically designed for proving equalities in ring-like structures, which should handle this arithmetic simplification effectively.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that while our approach of using 'rw' to expand definitions was correct, the final step using 'rfl' was not sufficient. The 'rfl' tactic checks for definitional equality, which is stricter than mathematical equality. In this case, x + 1 + 1 and x + 2 are mathematically equal but not definitionally equal in Lean 4's type system.\n\nTo improve our proving process, we should use a tactic that can handle ring-like structures and prove equalities involving addition. The 'ring' tactic is ideal for this situation. It's designed to prove equalities in algebraic structures like rings, which includes the integers we're working with here.\n\nFor future proofs involving arithmetic equalities, especially with integers, we should consider using 'ring' or other specialized tactics like 'norm_num' instead of relying on 'rfl'. This will make our proofs more robust and capable of handling a wider range of arithmetic simplifications.\n\nIn the next attempt, we should keep the 'rw' steps to expand the definitions, and then conclude the proof with 'ring' instead of 'rfl'. This adjustment should successfully complete the proof while maintaining a clear and idiomatic approach in Lean 4.",
