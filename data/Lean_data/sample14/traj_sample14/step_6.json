    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem shift_left1_plus_one:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_left1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_left1' applies a function to (x + 1)\n\n2. Expand the left-hand side:\n   - Start with shift_left1 plus_one x\n   - Apply the definition of shift_left1\n   - This should result in plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Apply the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one (x + 1) according to its definition\n   - This should give (x + 1) + 1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Rearrange (x + 1) + 1 to x + (1 + 1)\n   - Simplify 1 + 1 to 2\n   - Obtain the final form x + 2\n\n5. Compare with the right-hand side:\n   - Verify that the simplified left-hand side matches the right-hand side (x + 2)\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - Consider using 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply definitions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification steps\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplification\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the left-hand side has been transformed to match the right-hand side exactly\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, simplifying expressions, and comparing the results to the desired outcome.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is on the right track, but we need to make a small adjustment to complete it successfully. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. The first two 'rw' steps were correct and have successfully expanded the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'plus_one'.\n\n2. The current goal is to prove that 'x + 1 + 1 = x + 2', which is a straightforward linear arithmetic equation.\n\n3. The 'simp' tactic failed to make progress on this goal, likely because it's not specialized for integer arithmetic simplifications.\n\n4. Given that we're dealing with linear integer arithmetic, the 'linarith' tactic is the most appropriate choice. It's designed specifically for solving such equations in Lean 4.\n\n5. The 'linarith' tactic should be able to automatically prove the equality 'x + 1 + 1 = x + 2' without any additional steps.\n\n6. After applying 'linarith', the proof should be complete, and no further tactics should be necessary.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to replace the 'simp' and 'rfl' tactics with a single 'linarith' tactic. This should complete the proof efficiently and effectively.\n",
