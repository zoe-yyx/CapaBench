    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem shift_left1_plus_one:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_left1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_left1' applies a function to (x + 1)\n\n2. Expand the left-hand side:\n   - Start with shift_left1 plus_one x\n   - Apply the definition of shift_left1\n   - This should result in plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Apply the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one (x + 1) according to its definition\n   - This should give (x + 1) + 1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Rearrange (x + 1) + 1 to x + (1 + 1)\n   - Simplify 1 + 1 to 2\n   - Obtain the final form x + 2\n\n5. Compare with the right-hand side:\n   - Verify that the simplified left-hand side matches the right-hand side (x + 2)\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - Consider using 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply definitions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification steps\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplification\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the left-hand side has been transformed to match the right-hand side exactly\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, simplifying expressions, and comparing the results to the desired outcome.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof strategy has correctly expanded the definitions using 'rw' tactics, but the final step using 'rfl' failed because x + 1 + 1 and x + 2 are not definitionally equal in Lean 4, despite being mathematically equivalent.\n\nTo address this, we should maintain the current structure of the proof but replace the final 'rfl' tactic with 'ring'. The 'ring' tactic is specifically designed to handle equalities in ring-like structures, such as the integers we're working with here.\n\nThe reasoning for this approach is as follows:\n\n1. The 'rw [shift_left1]' and 'rw [plus_one]' steps are correct and necessary to expand the definitions.\n2. After these expansions, we're left with the goal of proving x + 1 + 1 = x + 2.\n3. This equality is true for all integers x, but it requires algebraic simplification that 'rfl' cannot handle automatically.\n4. The 'ring' tactic is specifically designed for such algebraic simplifications in ring-like structures.\n5. Using 'ring' will automatically perform the necessary simplification and complete the proof.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should keep the first two lines of the proof (the 'rw' tactics) and replace 'rfl' with 'ring' as the final step. This approach maintains the clear structure of the proof while providing the necessary power to handle the arithmetic equality.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The 'ring' tactic is not recognized in Lean 4, causing the proof to fail.\nImprovement: Replace the 'ring' tactic with 'simp' or a combination of 'simp' and 'rfl' to handle the arithmetic simplification.\n```\n\nThe current proof strategy was on the right track by expanding the definitions using 'rw' tactics. However, the final step using the 'ring' tactic failed because 'ring' is not a built-in tactic in Lean 4 as it was in Lean 3.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should maintain the current structure but replace the 'ring' tactic with a combination of tactics that are available and effective in Lean 4. The 'simp' tactic is a good candidate for simplifying arithmetic expressions. In some cases, 'simp' alone might be sufficient to prove the equality. If not, a combination of 'simp' followed by 'rfl' could work.\n\nThe reasoning for this approach is:\n\n1. The 'rw [shift_left1]' and 'rw [plus_one]' steps are correct and necessary to expand the definitions.\n2. After these expansions, we're left with the goal of proving x + 1 + 1 = x + 2.\n3. The 'simp' tactic in Lean 4 can handle many arithmetic simplifications.\n4. If 'simp' doesn't completely solve the goal, 'rfl' can be used to check if the simplified expressions are definitionally equal.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should keep the first two lines of the proof (the 'rw' tactics) and replace 'ring' with either 'simp' alone or 'simp' followed by 'rfl'. This approach should provide the necessary power to handle the arithmetic equality while using tactics available in Lean 4.",
