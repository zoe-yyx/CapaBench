    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem shift_left1_plus_one:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_left1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_left1' applies a function to (x + 1)\n\n2. Expand the left-hand side:\n   - Start with shift_left1 plus_one x\n   - Apply the definition of shift_left1\n   - This should result in plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Apply the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one (x + 1) according to its definition\n   - This should give (x + 1) + 1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Rearrange (x + 1) + 1 to x + (1 + 1)\n   - Simplify 1 + 1 to 2\n   - Obtain the final form x + 2\n\n5. Compare with the right-hand side:\n   - Verify that the simplified left-hand side matches the right-hand side (x + 2)\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - Consider using 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply definitions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification steps\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplification\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the left-hand side has been transformed to match the right-hand side exactly\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, simplifying expressions, and comparing the results to the desired outcome.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection provided, here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. The existing 'rw' steps are correct and should be kept. They successfully unfold the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'plus_one', which is crucial for the proof.\n\n2. After these rewrites, we are left with the goal: x + 1 + 1 = x + 2. This is a simple arithmetic equality that needs to be proven.\n\n3. Instead of using the 'ring' tactic, which is not available in Lean 4, we should use tactics that are known to work in Lean 4 for arithmetic simplification.\n\n4. The 'simp' tactic is a powerful simplification tool in Lean 4 that can handle many arithmetic equalities. It's a good first choice for simplifying our current goal.\n\n5. If 'simp' alone doesn't solve the goal, we can follow it with 'linarith', which is specifically designed for linear arithmetic problems and is available in Lean 4.\n\n6. The combination of 'simp' and 'linarith' should be sufficient to prove the equality x + 1 + 1 = x + 2.\n\nTherefore, the next step in the proof should be to replace the 'ring' tactic with 'simp' followed by 'linarith' if necessary. This approach aligns with Lean 4's available tactics and should successfully complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The 'simp' tactic made no progress on the goal x + 1 + 1 = x + 2, indicating that it doesn't automatically simplify this arithmetic expression.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'simp' tactic with 'rfl' or 'norm_num' to prove the arithmetic equality, as these tactics are more suited for basic integer arithmetic in Lean 4.\n```\n\nThe current proof strategy was close, but encountered an issue with the 'simp' tactic not making any progress on the arithmetic equality. This is likely because 'simp' is not configured by default to handle such basic integer arithmetic.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should consider using tactics that are specifically designed for proving simple arithmetic equalities in Lean 4. The 'rfl' tactic (which stands for \"reflexivity\") can often prove simple equalities automatically. Alternatively, the 'norm_num' tactic is designed to normalize and prove numerical expressions.\n\nFor the next attempt, I suggest replacing the 'simp' line with either 'rfl' or 'norm_num'. These tactics should be able to handle the arithmetic equality x + 1 + 1 = x + 2 without requiring additional steps.\n\nIf these tactics don't solve the goal completely, we can still keep the 'linarith' tactic as a backup, although it may not be necessary for this simple equality.\n\nThis adjustment should lead to a successful proof of the theorem while adhering to Lean 4's available tactics and proof style.",
