    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem shift_left1_plus_one:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Analyze the definitions of 'plus_one' and 'shift_left1'\n   - Recognize that 'plus_one' adds 1 to its input\n   - Understand that 'shift_left1' applies a function to (x + 1)\n\n2. Expand the left-hand side:\n   - Start with shift_left1 plus_one x\n   - Apply the definition of shift_left1\n   - This should result in plus_one (x + 1)\n\n3. Apply the definition of plus_one:\n   - Expand plus_one (x + 1) according to its definition\n   - This should give (x + 1) + 1\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - Rearrange (x + 1) + 1 to x + (1 + 1)\n   - Simplify 1 + 1 to 2\n   - Obtain the final form x + 2\n\n5. Compare with the right-hand side:\n   - Verify that the simplified left-hand side matches the right-hand side (x + 2)\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics:\n   - Consider using 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to apply definitions\n   - Use 'simp' for simplification steps\n   - If needed, use 'ring' tactic for algebraic simplification\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure that the left-hand side has been transformed to match the right-hand side exactly\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, simplifying expressions, and comparing the results to the desired outcome.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure is correct in expanding the definitions of 'shift_left1' and 'plus_one' using the 'rw' tactic. However, the final step using 'ring' is not valid in Lean 4. To complete the proof, we should use tactics that are available and effective in Lean 4 for arithmetic simplification.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n1. Keep the existing 'rw' steps as they correctly expand the definitions.\n2. Replace the 'ring' tactic with 'simp', which is capable of handling many arithmetic simplifications in Lean 4.\n3. If 'simp' alone doesn't completely solve the goal, follow it with 'rfl' to check if the simplified expressions are definitionally equal.\n\nThis approach maintains the logical flow of the proof while using Lean 4 compatible tactics. The 'simp' tactic should be able to simplify 'x + 1 + 1' to 'x + 2', and if needed, 'rfl' can confirm the equality.\n\nSuggested next action:\nReplace the 'ring' tactic with 'simp' or a combination of 'simp' and 'rfl'. This should effectively handle the arithmetic simplification and complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The 'simp' tactic failed to make progress on simplifying the arithmetic expression 'x + 1 + 1 = x + 2'.\nImprovement: Replace 'simp' with 'linarith' tactic, which is specifically designed for linear integer arithmetic in Lean 4.\n```\n\nThe current proof strategy was close, but it encountered an issue with the 'simp' tactic not being able to handle the specific arithmetic simplification needed. The 'simp' tactic is general-purpose and doesn't always handle all arithmetic simplifications, especially when dealing with integers.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. Keep the initial 'rw' steps as they correctly expand the definitions.\n2. Replace 'simp' with 'linarith', which is a powerful tactic for solving linear integer arithmetic problems in Lean 4.\n3. Remove the 'rfl' tactic as it's not needed if 'linarith' succeeds.\n\nThe 'linarith' tactic is specifically designed to handle linear integer arithmetic, which is exactly what we're dealing with in this theorem. It should be able to automatically prove that 'x + 1 + 1 = x + 2'.\n\nFor future proofs involving integer arithmetic, consider using 'linarith' as a go-to tactic when dealing with linear equalities or inequalities. This aligns well with the goal of proving theorems efficiently in Lean 4.",
