    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a bidirectional implication (↔) between two statements\n   - Left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the proof into two directions\n   - Prove both directions separately: (→) and (←)\n\n3. Forward direction (→):\n   - Assume the left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Prove the right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n   - Strategy:\n     a. Introduce the assumption\n     b. Split the goal into two parts\n     c. Prove each part using the assumption\n\n4. Backward direction (←):\n   - Assume the right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n   - Prove the left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Strategy:\n     a. Introduce the assumption\n     b.

Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n   - Check for any remaining obligations\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and addressing both directions of the bidirectional implication.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the forward direction (→), we should focus on proving that (∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a) implies (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a). Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the assumption:\n   Use 'intro h' to assume (∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a).\n\n2. Split the goal:\n   Apply 'apply And.intro' to split the goal into two parts:\n   - ∀ a : A, P a\n   - ∀ a : A, Q a\n\n3. Prove the first part (∀ a : A, P a):\n   a. Introduce a universal quantifier with 'intro a'.\n   b. Apply the assumption 'h' to 'a' using 'have h_a := h a'.\n   c. Extract P a from h_a using 'exact (And.left h_a)'.\n\n4. Prove the second part (∀ a : A, Q a):\n   a. Introduce a universal quantifier with 'intro a'.\n   b. Apply the assumption 'h' to 'a' using 'have h_a := h a'.\n   c. Extract Q a from h_a using 'exact (And.right h_a)'.\n\nThese steps will replace the 'sorry' in the forward direction with a complete proof, demonstrating that the left side of the bi-implication implies the right side.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The backward direction (←) of the bi-implication is incomplete and uses 'sorry', leaving the proof unfinished.\n\nImprovement: Complete the backward direction by introducing the assumption, applying it to an arbitrary element, and constructing the conjunction P a ∧ Q a using And.intro.\n```\n\nThe forward direction of the proof has been successfully completed, demonstrating that (∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a) implies (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a). This part of the proof is well-structured and logically sound.\n\nHowever, the backward direction is currently incomplete, using 'sorry' as a placeholder. To improve the proof, we need to focus on completing this direction. Here's a more detailed strategy for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the assumption for the backward direction:\n   Use 'intro h' to assume ((∀ a : A, P a) ∧ ∀ a : A, Q a).\n\n2. Introduce a universal quantifier:\n   Use 'intro a' to consider an arbitrary element of type A.\n\n3. Split the assumption:\n   Use 'cases h with h_p h_q' to split the conjunction into two parts:\n   - h_p : ∀ a : A, P a\n   - h_q : ∀ a : A, Q a\n\n4. Apply the split assumptions to the arbitrary element:\n   Use 'have p_a := h_p a' and 'have q_a := h_q a' to get:\n   - p_a : P a\n   - q_a : Q a\n\n5. Construct the final conjunction:\n   Use 'exact And.intro p_a q_a' to prove P a ∧ Q a.\n\nBy following these steps, we can complete the backward direction of the proof without using 'sorry', thus finishing the entire proof of the bi-implication. This approach maintains the rigor of the proof and ensures that both directions are fully demonstrated.",
