Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a bidirectional implication (↔) between two statements\n   - Left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the proof into two directions\n   - Prove both directions separately: (→) and (←)\n\n3. Forward direction (→):\n   - Assume the left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Prove the right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n   - Strategy:\n     a. Introduce the assumption\n     b.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no historical actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the first step of our plan. The theorem is a bidirectional implication, so we need to prove both directions.\n\nTo begin, we should use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic. This will split our proof into two parts, corresponding to the forward (→) and backward (←) directions of the implication.\n\nAfter applying this tactic, we expect to see two goals:\n\n1. (∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a) → (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n2. (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a) → (∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a)\n\nThese goals align with our plan to prove both directions separately. Once we have these goals, we can proceed with the forward direction proof as outlined in step 3 of our plan.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step for the acting agent is to apply the `Iff.intro` tactic to set up the structure for our bidirectional proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The use of 'sorry' in both directions of the proof indicates a lack of actual proof steps, leaving the theorem unproven.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'sorry' with actual proof steps, starting with the forward direction by introducing assumptions and using tactics like 'intro', 'apply', and 'exact' to construct the proof.\n```\n\nThe current approach has correctly set up the structure for a bidirectional proof using `apply Iff.intro`, which is a good start. However, the use of `sorry` in both directions means that no actual proving has been done yet.\n\nFor the forward direction (→), we should:\n1. Introduce the assumption using `intro h`.\n2. Split the goal into two parts using `apply And.intro`.\n3. For each part, introduce a universal quantifier with `intro a`.\n4. Use `h` to deduce `P a` and `Q a` separately.\n\nFor the backward direction (←), we should:\n1. Introduce the assumption using `intro h`.\n2. Introduce the universal quantifier with `intro a`.\n3. Split `h` into its two parts using `cases h with hP hQ`.\n4. Use `hP` and `hQ` to deduce `P a ∧ Q a`.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should focus on implementing these steps for the forward direction, replacing the `sorry` with actual proof tactics. This will move us closer to a complete and rigorous proof of the theorem.",
