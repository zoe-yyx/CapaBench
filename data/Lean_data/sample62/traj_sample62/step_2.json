    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a bidirectional implication (↔) between two statements\n   - Left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n\n2. Plan the proof approach:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the proof into two directions\n   - Prove both directions separately: (→) and (←)\n\n3. Forward direction (→):\n   - Assume the left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Prove the right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n   - Strategy:\n     a. Introduce the assumption\n     b. Split the goal into two parts\n     c. Prove each part using the assumption\n\n4. Backward direction (←):\n   - Assume the right side: (∀ a : A, P a) ∧ (∀ a : A, Q a)\n   - Prove the left side: ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n   - Strategy:\n     a. Introduce the assumption\n     b. Introduce an arbitrary element of A\n     c. Use the assumption to prove both P a and Q a\n     d. Combine the results to form P a ∧ Q a\n\n5. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed\n   - Check for any remaining obligations\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and addressing both directions of the bidirectional implication.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof, we need to focus on the backward direction (←) of the bi-implication. The goal is to prove:\n\n((∀ a : A, P a) ∧ ∀ a : A, Q a) → ∀ a : A, P a ∧ Q a\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning for the next operations:\n\n1. Introduce the assumption:\n   Use 'intro h' to assume ((∀ a : A, P a) ∧ ∀ a : A, Q a).\n\n2. Introduce a universal quantifier:\n   Use 'intro a' to consider an arbitrary element of type A.\n\n3. Split the assumption:\n   Use 'cases h with h_p h_q' to separate the conjunction into two parts:\n   - h_p : ∀ a : A, P a\n   - h_q : ∀ a : A, Q a\n\n4. Apply the split assumptions to the arbitrary element:\n   Use 'have p_a := h_p a' to get p_a : P a\n   Use 'have q_a := h_q a' to get q_a : Q a\n\n5. Construct the final conjunction:\n   Use 'exact And.intro p_a q_a' to prove P a ∧ Q a\n\nThese steps will systematically prove the backward direction, completing the bi-implication proof without using 'sorry'. This approach maintains the logical structure of the proof and ensures that both directions are rigorously demonstrated.\n",
