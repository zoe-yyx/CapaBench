Analyze the problem:\n   - We are working with the Tree data type and the treeReverse function.\n   - The theorem states that reversing a leaf node results in a leaf node.\n\n2. Understand the definitions:\n   - Tree is an inductive type with two constructors: leaf and node.\n   - treeReverse is defined recursively for both leaf and node cases.\n\n3. Focus on the leaf case:\n   - The theorem specifically deals with the leaf case of treeReverse.\n\n4. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side of the equation: treeReverse leaf\n   b. Apply the definition of treeReverse for the leaf case\n   c. Show that this results in leaf (the right-hand side of the equation)\n\n5. Expected steps in the proof:\n   a. Unfold the definition of treeReverse\n   b. Simplify the expression\n   c. Verify that the result matches the right-hand side of the equation\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - rfl (reflexivity) might be sufficient for this simple case\n   - If needed, use simp to simplify expressions\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - This theorem serves as a base case for more complex proofs involving treeReverse\n   - It verifies the correctness of treeReverse for the simplest possible tree structure\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe theorem leafTreeReverse: treeReverse leaf = leaf is a straightforward case that directly follows from the definition of treeReverse. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. The left-hand side of the equation is treeReverse leaf.\n\n2. According to the definition of treeReverse, when applied to a leaf, it simply returns leaf:\n   def treeReverse : Tree → Tree\n   | leaf => leaf\n   | node l v r => node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l)\n\n3. Therefore, treeReverse leaf evaluates to leaf.\n\n4. The right-hand side of the equation is also leaf.\n\n5. Since both sides of the equation evaluate to the same term (leaf), the equality holds.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the proof should be trivial and can likely be completed in a single step using the rfl (reflexivity) tactic. The rfl tactic is used when the left and right sides of an equation are definitionally equal, which is the case here.\n\nSuggested next action for the acting agent:\nUse the rfl tactic to complete the proof. This should be sufficient to prove the theorem without any additional steps or manipulations.\n",
