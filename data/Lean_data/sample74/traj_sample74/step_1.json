Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q on type A\n   - We have a specific element a0 of type A\n   - The goal is to prove Q a0\n\n2. Identify the given hypotheses:\n   - P a0 (P holds for a0)\n   - ∀ a : A, P a → Q a (For all a in A, if P holds for a, then Q holds for a)\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Introduce the hypotheses into the local context\n   b. Apply the universal quantifier to a0\n   c. Use modus ponens to derive Q a0\n\n4. Step-by-step plan:\n   a. intro (introduce the hypotheses)\n   b. apply the second hypothesis to a0\n   c. apply the result of step b to the first hypothesis\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - intro\n   - apply\n   - exact\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the final step proves Q a0\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Proper application of the universal quantifier\n   - Correct use of modus ponens\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the theorem logicEx6 using basic logical reasoning and Lean 4 tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced the hypotheses into our local context using the `intro` tactic. Now we have:\n\nh1 : P a0\nh2 : ∀ (a : A), P a → Q a\n\nOur goal is to prove Q a0.\n\nThe next logical step is to apply the universal quantifier h2 to our specific instance a0. This will give us a new hypothesis that we can use to prove our goal.\n\nWe can do this by applying h2 to a0. In Lean 4, we can use the `apply` tactic for this purpose. \n\nAfter applying h2 to a0, we expect to get a new subgoal P a0 → Q a0. This is because h2 states that for all a in A, P a implies Q a. When we specify a = a0, we get P a0 → Q a0.\n\nOnce we have this new subgoal, we can prove it easily because we already have h1 : P a0 in our context.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to apply h2 to a0.\n",
