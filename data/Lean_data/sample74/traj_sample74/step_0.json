    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem logicEx6:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q on type A\n   - We have a specific element a0 of type A\n   - The goal is to prove Q a0\n\n2. Identify the given hypotheses:\n   - P a0 (P holds for a0)\n   - ∀ a : A, P a → Q a (For all a in A, if P holds for a, then Q holds for a)\n\n3. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Introduce the hypotheses into the local context\n   b. Apply the universal quantifier to a0\n   c. Use modus ponens to derive Q a0\n\n4. Step-by-step plan:\n   a. intro (introduce the hypotheses)\n   b. apply the second hypothesis to a0\n   c. apply the result of step b to the first hypothesis\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - intro\n   - apply\n   - exact\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the final step proves Q a0\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Proper application of the universal quantifier\n   - Correct use of modus ponens\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the theorem logicEx6 using basic logical reasoning and Lean 4 tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the first step of our plan: introducing the hypotheses into the local context.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem has two explicit hypotheses: P a0 and (∀ a : A, P a → Q a).\n2. We need to introduce these hypotheses into our local context to work with them.\n3. In Lean 4, the 'intro' tactic is used to introduce hypotheses and name them.\n\nGuidance for the next action:\nUse the 'intro' tactic to introduce both hypotheses. We should give them meaningful names to make the proof easier to follow. Suggested names could be:\n- 'h1' for the hypothesis P a0\n- 'h2' for the hypothesis ∀ a : A, P a → Q a\n\nThe acting agent should use the 'intro' tactic twice, once for each hypothesis. This will set up our local context with the necessary assumptions to proceed with the proof.\n",
