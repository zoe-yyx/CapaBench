    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves four propositions: P1, Q1, P2, Q2\n   - It has two hypotheses: (P1 ↔ P2) and (Q1 ↔ Q2)\n   - The conclusion is a bi-implication: (P1 ∧ Q1 ↔ P2 ∧ Q2)\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypotheses\n   - Split the bi-implication in the conclusion into two implications\n   - Prove each direction of the bi-implication separately\n\n3. For the forward direction (P1 ∧ Q1 → P2 ∧ Q2):\n   - Assume P1 ∧ Q1\n   - Split this conjunction into its components\n   - Use the hypotheses to transform P1 to P2 and Q1 to Q2\n   - Combine P2 and Q2 to form P2 ∧ Q2\n\n4. For the backward direction (P2 ∧ Q2 → P1 ∧ Q1):\n   - Assume P2 ∧ Q2\n   - Split this conjunction into its components\n   - Use the hypotheses to transform P2 to P1 and Q2 to Q1\n   - Combine P1 and Q1 to form P1 ∧ Q1\n\n5. Conclude the proof by combining both directions\n\n6. Throughout the proof, use appropriate tactics such as:\n   - `intro` for introducing hypotheses\n   - `constructor` for splitting bi-implications and forming conjunctions\n   - `cases` for breaking down conjunctions\n   - `exact` or `apply` for using hypotheses and previous results\n\n7. Use the principle of extensionality for propositions where necessary\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced the hypotheses and split the bi-implication into two cases. Now we need to focus on proving each direction separately.\n\nFor the first case (mp: P1 ∧ Q1 → P2 ∧ Q2):\n1. We have h3 : P1 ∧ Q1 as our assumption.\n2. We need to break this conjunction into its components using the `cases` tactic.\n3. Then, we'll use the hypotheses h1 and h2 to transform P1 to P2 and Q1 to Q2.\n4. Finally, we'll construct P2 ∧ Q2 using the `constructor` tactic.\n\nFor the second case (mpr: P2 ∧ Q2 → P1 ∧ Q1):\n1. We have h3 : P2 ∧ Q2 as our assumption.\n2. We'll follow a similar process as in the first case, but in the opposite direction.\n3. Break the conjunction h3 using `cases`.\n4. Use h1 and h2 to transform P2 to P1 and Q2 to Q1.\n5. Construct P1 ∧ Q1 using the `constructor` tactic.\n\nThe acting agent should start by focusing on the first case (mp) and implement the steps outlined above.\n",
