    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves four propositions: P1, Q1, P2, Q2\n   - It has two hypotheses: (P1 ↔ P2) and (Q1 ↔ Q2)\n   - The conclusion is a bi-implication: (P1 ∧ Q1 ↔ P2 ∧ Q2)\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypotheses\n   - Split the bi-implication in the conclusion into two implications\n   - Prove each direction of the bi-implication separately\n\n3. For the forward direction (P1 ∧ Q1 → P2 ∧ Q2):\n   - Assume P1 ∧ Q1\n   - Split this conjunction into its components\n   - Use the hypotheses to transform P1 to P2 and Q1 to Q2\n   - Combine P2 and Q2 to form P2 ∧ Q2\n\n4. For the backward direction (P2 ∧ Q2 → P1 ∧ Q1):\n   - Assume P2 ∧ Q2\n   - Split this conjunction into its components\n   - Use the hypotheses to transform P2 to P1 and Q2 to Q1\n   - Combine P1 and Q1 to form P1 ∧ Q1\n\n5. Conclude the proof by combining both directions\n\n6. Throughout the proof, use appropriate tactics such as:\n   - `intro` for introducing hypotheses\n   - `constructor` for splitting bi-implications and forming conjunctions\n   - `cases` for breaking down conjunctions\n   - `exact` or `apply` for using hypotheses and previous results\n\n7. Use the principle of extensionality for propositions where necessary\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, we should start by introducing the hypotheses and setting up the structure for the bi-implication in the conclusion. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the hypotheses:\n   We have two hypotheses in the theorem: (P1 ↔ P2) and (Q1 ↔ Q2). We should use the `intro` tactic to bring these into our context.\n\n2. Set up the bi-implication structure:\n   The conclusion (P1 ∧ Q1 ↔ P2 ∧ Q2) is a bi-implication. We should use the `constructor` tactic to split this into two implications that we'll prove separately.\n\n3. Prepare for the forward direction:\n   For the first implication (P1 ∧ Q1 → P2 ∧ Q2), we should introduce the assumption P1 ∧ Q1.\n\nThese steps will set up the basic structure of our proof and allow us to start working on the forward direction of the bi-implication. The acting agent should focus on implementing these initial steps to lay the foundation for the rest of the proof.\n",
