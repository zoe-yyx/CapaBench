Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that reversing treeExample0 results in the same tree.\n   - treeExample0 is defined as a node with value 1 and two leaf children.\n\n2.

Simplify the left-hand side:\n   - Apply treeReverse to treeExample0.\n   - Simplify the expression based on the treeReverse function definition.\n\n4. Compare the results:\n   - Show that the simplified left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side (treeExample0).\n\n5. Proof strategy:\n   - Use rfl (reflexivity) tactic if possible, as the equality should be true by definition.\n   - If rfl doesn't work, consider using simp to simplify both sides and then apply rfl.\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem treeExample0TreeReverse, our first step should be to expand the definitions of treeExample0 and treeReverse. This will allow us to see the actual structure we're working with and how the treeReverse function will act on it.\n\nThe acting agent should start by:\n\n1. Expanding the definition of treeExample0. This will show us that it's a node with value 1 and two leaf children.\n\n2. Then, we should apply the treeReverse function to this expanded form. The treeReverse function will swap the left and right subtrees, but since both are leaves, the overall structure will remain the same.\n\n3. After expanding and applying treeReverse, we should have an expression that is identical to the original treeExample0.\n\n4. At this point, the equality should be apparent, and we can likely prove it using the rfl (reflexivity) tactic.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on these steps, starting with expanding the definitions and then applying the treeReverse function. This should set up the proof for a straightforward completion using reflexivity.\n",
