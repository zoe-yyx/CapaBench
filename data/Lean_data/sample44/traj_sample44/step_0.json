Understand the given definitions and hypotheses:\n   - Definition of 'convex' function\n   - Definition of 'mono' (monotonic) function\n   - The two given hypotheses about T preserving monotonicity and convexity\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Introduce the hypotheses\n   - State the goal: prove mono (T f) ∧ convex (T f)\n\n3. Break down the goal:\n   - We need to prove two parts: mono (T f) and convex (T f)\n\n4. Utilize the given hypotheses:\n   - Use the first hypothesis to prove mono (T f)\n   - Use the second hypothesis to prove convex (T f)\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - Use the 'and' introduction rule to combine mono (T f) and convex (T f)\n\n6. Key steps in the proof:\n   - Introduce a function f that satisfies mono f ∧ convex f\n   - Apply the first hypothesis to f to show mono (T f)\n   - Apply the second hypothesis to f to show convex (T f)\n   - Combine these results to conclude mono (T f) ∧ convex (T f)\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct application of hypotheses\n   - Properly handle the logical structure of implications and conjunctions\n\n8. Verification:\n   - Check that all hypotheses are used\n   - Ensure the conclusion matches the theorem statement\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, focusing on utilizing the given hypotheses and breaking down the goal into manageable steps.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem logicEx1, we should start by introducing the hypotheses and setting up the structure of the proof. The theorem is an implication, so we'll use the 'intro' tactic to introduce the hypotheses. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the two hypotheses of the theorem:\n   - The first hypothesis states that T preserves monotonicity for all functions f.\n   - The second hypothesis states that T preserves convexity for all functions f.\n\n2. Introduce a function f that satisfies both mono f and convex f.\n\n3. Our goal will be to prove mono (T f) ∧ convex (T f) for this function f.\n\n4. We'll need to apply the hypotheses to our specific function f to prove each part of the conjunction.\n\nThe acting agent should start by using the 'intro' tactic to introduce these hypotheses and set up the proof structure. This will allow us to work with these hypotheses in the subsequent steps of the proof.\n",
