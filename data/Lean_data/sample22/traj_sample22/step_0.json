Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that multiplication is associative for integers.\n   - The theorem name is 'mult_assoc'.\n   - We're using the 'assoc' definition for associativity.\n\n2. Expand the definition:\n   - Unfold the 'assoc' definition for the multiplication function.\n   - This will give us the goal: ∀ x y z, (fun x y => x * y) x ((fun x y => x * y) y z) = (fun x y => x * y) ((fun x y => x * y) x y) z\n\n3. Simplify the goal:\n   - Reduce the lambda functions to get: ∀ x y z, x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z\n\n4. Prove the equality:\n   - Use integer multiplication properties to show that x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z for all x, y, and z.\n\n5. Utilize Mathlib tactics:\n   - The 'Ring' tactic from Mathlib.Tactic.Ring might be useful for proving this algebraic equality.\n\n6. Structure the proof:\n   - Start by introducing arbitrary integers x, y, and z.\n   - Apply the Ring tactic or explicitly prove the equality using multiplication properties.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered for arbitrary x, y, and z.\n   - Close the proof once the equality is established for all integers.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the associativity of integer multiplication, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' for the multiplication function. This will set up our goal in terms of arbitrary integers x, y, and z.\n\n2. The goal should look like: ∀ x y z, x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z\n\n3. To prove this, we can use the Ring tactic from Mathlib.Tactic.Ring, which is particularly suited for proving algebraic equalities like associativity.\n\n4. The proof structure should be:\n   a. Introduce arbitrary integers x, y, and z.\n   b. Apply the Ring tactic to prove the equality.\n\n5. Given that we've imported Mathlib.Tactic.Ring at the beginning of the file, we have access to the Ring tactic.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent start the proof by introducing the variables and then immediately applying the Ring tactic. This should be sufficient to prove the theorem in one step, as the Ring tactic is powerful enough to handle associativity of multiplication for integers.\n",
