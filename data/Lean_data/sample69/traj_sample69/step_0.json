Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that if there doesn't exist an x that satisfies P, then for all x, P(x) is false.\n   - The theorem uses classical logic (open Classical).\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: ¬(∃ x : X, P x)\n   - Introduce an arbitrary x : X\n   - Goal: prove ¬P x\n\n3. Use proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume P x is true\n   - Aim to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis\n\n4. Key steps:\n   a) From P x, construct an existence proof (∃ x : X, P x)\n   b) This directly contradicts the hypothesis ¬(∃ x : X, P x)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses and arbitrary x\n   - by_contra: for proof by contradiction\n   - use: to apply the existential quantifier\n   - exact: to finish the proof with the contradiction\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof relies on the law of excluded middle (part of classical logic)\n   - The strategy converts a universal statement about non-existence into a statement about all individuals\n\nRemember to guide the player through each step, ensuring they understand the logical flow and the use of classical logic in this proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof, our first step should be to set up the basic structure according to the planning strategy. We need to:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis ¬(∃ x : X, P x)\n2. Introduce an arbitrary x : X\n3. Set up the goal to prove ¬P x\n\nTo achieve this, we should use the 'intro' tactic multiple times. This will allow us to bring the hypothesis and the arbitrary x into our local context, setting us up to prove the goal for this arbitrary x.\n\nAfter setting up the structure, we'll be in a position to start the proof by contradiction, which is a key strategy mentioned in the plan.\n\nTherefore, I recommend guiding the acting agent to use the 'intro' tactic multiple times to set up the proof structure.\n",
