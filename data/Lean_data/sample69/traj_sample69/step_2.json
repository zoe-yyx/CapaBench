    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem notExists:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that if there doesn't exist an x that satisfies P, then for all x, P(x) is false.\n   - The theorem uses classical logic (open Classical).\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: ¬(∃ x : X, P x)\n   - Introduce an arbitrary x : X\n   - Goal: prove ¬P x\n\n3. Use proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume P x is true\n   - Aim to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis\n\n4. Key steps:\n   a) From P x, construct an existence proof (∃ x : X, P x)\n   b) This directly contradicts the hypothesis ¬(∃ x : X, P x)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses and arbitrary x\n   - by_contra: for proof by contradiction\n   - use: to apply the existential quantifier\n   - exact: to finish the proof with the contradiction\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof relies on the law of excluded middle (part of classical logic)\n   - The strategy converts a universal statement about non-existence into a statement about all individuals\n\nRemember to guide the player through each step, ensuring they understand the logical flow and the use of classical logic in this proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof strategy is correct, but we need to adjust the final steps to properly demonstrate the contradiction. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've successfully introduced the hypothesis (h), the arbitrary x, and assumed P x (px).\n2. Our goal now is to derive a contradiction, which will prove ¬P x.\n3. We need to show that the existence of an x satisfying P x contradicts our hypothesis h.\n4. Instead of applying h, we should construct the existential proof and use it to contradict h directly.\n5. We can use the 'exact' tactic to provide the full contradiction in one step.\n6. The contradiction will take the form: h ⟨x, px⟩, where:\n   - h is our hypothesis that ¬(∃ x, P x)\n   - ⟨x, px⟩ is the proof that ∃ x, P x (x is our witness, and px is the proof that P x holds)\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to replace the last line (apply h) with:\n\nexact h ⟨x, px⟩\n\nThis will complete the proof by showing that assuming P x leads to a contradiction with our hypothesis, thus proving ¬P x for our arbitrary x.\n",
