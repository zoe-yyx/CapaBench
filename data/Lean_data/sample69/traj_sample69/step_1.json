Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that if there doesn't exist an x that satisfies P, then for all x, P(x) is false.\n   - The theorem uses classical logic (open Classical).\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: ¬(∃ x : X, P x)\n   - Introduce an arbitrary x : X\n   - Goal: prove ¬P x\n\n3. Use proof by contradiction:\n   - Assume P x is true\n   - Aim to derive a contradiction with the hypothesis\n\n4. Key steps:\n   a) From P x, construct an existence proof (∃ x : X, P x)\n   b) This directly contradicts the hypothesis ¬(∃ x : X, P x)\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses and arbitrary x\n   - by_contra: for proof by contradiction\n   - use: to apply the existential quantifier\n   - exact: to finish the proof with the contradiction\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof relies on the law of excluded middle (part of classical logic)\n   - The strategy converts a universal statement about non-existence into a statement about all individuals\n\nRemember to guide the player through each step, ensuring they understand the logical flow and the use of classical logic in this proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we've made good progress. Let's analyze where we are and determine the next logical step:\n\n1. We've successfully introduced our hypothesis (h : ¬∃ x, P x), an arbitrary x, and assumed P x (px : P x).\n2. Our current goal is to prove False, which aligns with our plan to use proof by contradiction.\n3. We now need to derive a contradiction using our assumptions.\n\nThe key insight here is that we have px : P x, which means we have a specific x that satisfies P. This directly contradicts our hypothesis h : ¬∃ x, P x.\n\nTo proceed, we should:\n\n1. Use the 'use' tactic to construct an existence proof from our px : P x.\n2. This will give us ∃ x, P x, which directly contradicts h.\n3. We can then use the 'exact' tactic to finish the proof by pointing out this contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the next logical steps for the acting agent should be:\n\n1. Apply 'use x' to construct the existence proof.\n2. Apply 'exact h (⟨x, px⟩)' to finish the proof by contradiction.\n\nThis reasoning follows our original plan and leverages the contradiction between our hypothesis and the assumed P x to complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was correct, but the final step using 'apply h' was incorrect as it changed the goal to '∃ x, P x' instead of proving False.\n\nImprovement: Instead of applying 'h' directly, we should use 'exact h ⟨x, px⟩' to finish the proof by directly contradicting the hypothesis with the existence of x satisfying P x.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that while the overall strategy was sound, there was a misstep in the final execution. The proof was on the right track until the last step, where 'apply h' was used instead of directly providing the contradiction.\n\nTo improve in the next round:\n\n1. We should be more careful about the effects of each tactic on the goal state.\n2. When dealing with negations and existential quantifiers, it's often more effective to construct the contradiction explicitly rather than applying the negation hypothesis.\n3. We should emphasize the importance of using 'exact' with the full contradiction (h ⟨x, px⟩) to complete the proof in one step.\n4. It might be helpful to remind the acting agent to double-check the goal state after each step to ensure we're moving in the right direction.\n\nThese insights should help guide the next iteration of the proof attempt, leading to a successful completion of the theorem.",
