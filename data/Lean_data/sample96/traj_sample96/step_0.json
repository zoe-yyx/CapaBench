    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves two universal quantifiers (∀) and a proposition P that takes two arguments.\n   - The goal is to prove that if P holds for all x and y, then it also holds for all y and x (with the order swapped).\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypotheses: assume (∀ x y, P x y) is true.\n   - Introduce arbitrary variables y and x to prove (∀ y x, P x y).\n\n3. Apply logical reasoning:\n   - Use the hypothesis (∀ x y, P x y) to show that P x y holds for any specific x and y.\n   - Demonstrate that this implies P x y also holds when the order of x and y is swapped.\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - Show that since P x y holds for arbitrary y and x, the statement (∀ y x, P x y) is true.\n\n5. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the hypothesis to specific variables\n   - exact: to provide the final proof term\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Keeping track of variable names and their order\n   - Properly applying universal quantifiers\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure that the proof covers all cases and logically follows from the given hypothesis to the conclusion.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem forall_forall, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis that assumes (∀ x y, P x y) is true. This will be our starting point.\n\n2. Next, we need to prove (∀ y x, P x y). To do this, we should introduce arbitrary variables y and x.\n\n3. Once we have these arbitrary variables, we can apply our hypothesis to show that P x y holds for these specific x and y.\n\n4. Finally, we can conclude that since P x y holds for arbitrary y and x, the statement (∀ y x, P x y) is true.\n\nGiven that we're using Lean 4, the acting agent should start by using the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypothesis and the arbitrary variables. This will set up the proof structure and allow us to work with concrete terms.\n\nThe next step in the reasoning process will be to apply the introduced hypothesis to our arbitrary variables, effectively swapping their order to match our goal.\n",
