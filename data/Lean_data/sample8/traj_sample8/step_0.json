Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that plus_one (plus_one 1) = 3\n   - plus_one is defined as a function that adds 1 to its input\n\n2. Break down the expression:\n   - Evaluate plus_one (plus_one 1) step by step\n   - First, calculate plus_one 1\n   - Then, apply plus_one to the result\n\n3. Use function definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of plus_one for each application\n\n4. Simplify arithmetic:\n   - Perform integer addition\n\n5. Prove equality:\n   - Show that the final result equals 3\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - rw (rewrite) to expand function definitions\n   - simp to simplify arithmetic expressions\n   - rfl for reflexivity, if the equality becomes obvious\n\n7. Potential steps:\n   - Expand outer plus_one\n   - Expand inner plus_one\n   - Simplify the resulting arithmetic expression\n   - Show equality to 3\n\n8. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step is logically sound\n   - Confirm the final result matches the theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem One_plus_one_plus_one, we need to systematically break down the expression plus_one (plus_one 1) and evaluate it step by step. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Start by expanding the outer plus_one function. This will give us a clearer view of the expression we're working with.\n\n2. After expanding the outer plus_one, we'll have an expression like (plus_one 1) + 1. We should then focus on expanding the inner plus_one function.\n\n3. Once both plus_one functions are expanded, we'll have a simple arithmetic expression involving integer addition.\n\n4. The resulting expression should be straightforward to simplify to 3.\n\n5. After simplification, we can use reflexivity to prove the equality.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by using the rw tactic to expand the definition of plus_one. This will set the stage for further simplification and eventual proof of the theorem.\n",
