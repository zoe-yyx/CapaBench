    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for andOrDistrL:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that P ∧ (Q ∨ R) is logically equivalent to (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R).\n   - We need to prove both directions of the bi-implication (↔).\n\n2. Break down the proof into two main parts:\n   a) Left to right: P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   b) Right to left: (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n3. For the left to right direction:\n   - Assume P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   - Split this into P and (Q ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on (Q ∨ R)\n   - For Q, prove (P ∧ Q), which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - For R, prove (P ∧ R), which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n\n4. For the right to left direction:\n   - Assume (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on this disjunction\n   - For (P ∧ Q), prove P and then Q ∨ R\n   - For (P ∧ R), prove P and then Q ∨ R\n   - Combine these to get P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n5. Use Lean 4 tactics:\n   - apply Iff.intro to split into two implications\n   - use intro for assumptions\n   - apply And.intro and And.left/And.right for conjunctions\n   - apply Or.inl and Or.inr for disjunctions\n   - use cases for case analysis\n\n6. Reflect on the proof structure:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the proof is complete and concise\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the reflection, we should focus on proving the left-to-right direction first. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We need to prove P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R.\n\n2. Start by introducing the hypothesis:\n   - Use 'intro h' to assume P ∧ (Q ∨ R).\n\n3. Split the conjunction in the hypothesis:\n   - Use 'cases h with hP hQR' to get:\n     hP : P\n     hQR : Q ∨ R\n\n4. Now we need to prove P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R. We can do this by cases on hQR:\n   - Use 'cases hQR with hQ hR' to consider both cases of Q ∨ R.\n\n5. For the case where Q is true:\n   - We need to prove (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R).\n   - We can use 'apply Or.inl' to choose the left side of the disjunction.\n   - Then use 'constructor' to prove P ∧ Q using hP and hQ.\n\n6. For the case where R is true:\n   - We need to prove (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R).\n   - We can use 'apply Or.inr' to choose the right side of the disjunction.\n   - Then use 'constructor' to prove P ∧ R using hP and hR.\n\nThis reasoning provides a step-by-step guide for proving the left-to-right direction of the bi-implication. The acting agent should implement these steps to replace the first 'sorry' in the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current state of the proof and the actions taken, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete as the right-to-left direction (P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)) is still unproven and replaced with 'sorry'.\n\nImprovement: To complete the proof, we need to implement a similar strategy for the right-to-left direction, using case analysis on the disjunction P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R and constructing the conjunction P ∧ (Q ∨ R) in each case.\n```\n\nThe left-to-right direction of the proof has been successfully completed, which is a positive step. The reasoning and actions taken for this part were correct and effective. However, the proof is still incomplete because the right-to-left direction remains unproven.\n\nTo improve in the next steps:\n\n1. We should focus on proving P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R → P ∧ (Q ∨ R).\n\n2. Start by introducing the hypothesis:\n   - Use 'intro h' to assume P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R.\n\n3. Use case analysis on the disjunction:\n   - Use 'cases h with hPQ hPR' to consider both cases.\n\n4. For the case where P ∧ Q is true:\n   - Use 'cases hPQ with hP hQ' to split the conjunction.\n   - Use 'constructor' to prove P ∧ (Q ∨ R).\n   - For the first part, use 'exact hP'.\n   - For the second part, use 'apply Or.inl' followed by 'exact hQ'.\n\n5. For the case where P ∧ R is true:\n   - Use 'cases hPR with hP hR' to split the conjunction.\n   - Use 'constructor' to prove P ∧ (Q ∨ R).\n   - For the first part, use 'exact hP'.\n   - For the second part, use 'apply Or.inr' followed by 'exact hR'.\n\nBy implementing these steps, we should be able to complete the proof without using 'sorry'. The acting agent should focus on implementing this strategy for the right-to-left direction in the next round.",
