Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that P ∧ (Q ∨ R) is logically equivalent to (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R).\n   - We need to prove both directions of the bi-implication (↔).\n\n2. Break down the proof into two main parts:\n   a) Left to right: P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   b) Right to left: (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n3. For the left to right direction:\n   - Assume P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   - Split this into P and (Q ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on (Q ∨ R)\n   - For Q, prove (P ∧ Q), which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - For R, prove (P ∧ R), which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n\n4. For the right to left direction:\n   - Assume (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on this disjunction\n   - For (P ∧ Q), prove P and then Q ∨ R\n   - For (P ∧ R), prove P and then Q ∨ R\n   - Combine these to get P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n5. Use Lean 4 tactics:\n   - apply Iff.intro to split into two implications\n   - use intro for assumptions\n   - apply And.intro and And.left/And.right for conjunctions\n   - apply Or.inl and Or.inr for disjunctions\n   - use cases for case analysis\n\n6. Reflect on the proof structure:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the proof is complete and concise\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the strategic proving plan. The first step is to split the bi-implication (↔) into two separate implications. This will allow us to prove both directions independently.\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the bi-implication into two implications.\n2. This will create two subgoals:\n   a) P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   b) (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n3. After applying this tactic, we'll be able to focus on proving each direction separately.\n4. This aligns with steps 2 and 5 of our strategic proving plan.\n\nThe acting agent should proceed with applying the `Iff.intro` tactic to set up the structure for the rest of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete as it relies on 'sorry' tactics for both directions of the bi-implication.\n\nImprovement: We should replace the 'sorry' tactics with proper proof steps, starting with the left-to-right direction by using 'intro' to assume the hypothesis and then using 'cases' to handle the disjunction.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is correct, as it has successfully split the bi-implication into two directions. However, the use of 'sorry' tactics indicates that the actual proof steps are missing. To improve the proof, we need to focus on proving each direction separately.\n\nFor the left-to-right direction (P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R), we should:\n1. Use 'intro' to assume the hypothesis P ∧ (Q ∨ R).\n2. Use 'cases' to split the conjunction and handle the disjunction.\n3. Use 'constructor' or similar tactics to prove the goal in each case.\n\nFor the right-to-left direction ((P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)), we should:\n1. Use 'intro' to assume the hypothesis (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R).\n2. Use 'cases' to handle the disjunction in the hypothesis.\n3. Use 'constructor' to prove the conjunction in the goal.\n4. Use 'left' or 'right' to prove the disjunction in the goal.\n\nBy following these steps, we can replace the 'sorry' tactics with proper proof steps and complete the theorem rigorously. The reasoning and acting agents should focus on implementing these steps in the next iteration.",
