    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for andOrDistrL:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that P ∧ (Q ∨ R) is logically equivalent to (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R).\n   - We need to prove both directions of the bi-implication (↔).\n\n2. Break down the proof into two main parts:\n   a) Left to right: P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   b) Right to left: (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) → P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n3. For the left to right direction:\n   - Assume P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n   - Split this into P and (Q ∨ R)\n   - Use case analysis on (Q ∨ R)\n   - For Q, prove (P ∧ Q), which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - For R, prove (P ∧ R), which implies (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n\n4. For the right to left direction:\n   - Assume (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)\n   - Use case analysis on this disjunction\n   - For (P ∧ Q), prove P and then Q ∨ R\n   - For (P ∧ R), prove P and then Q ∨ R\n   - Combine these to get P ∧ (Q ∨ R)\n\n5. Use Lean 4 tactics:\n   - apply Iff.intro to split into two implications\n   - use intro for assumptions\n   - apply And.intro and And.left/And.right for conjunctions\n   - apply Or.inl and Or.inr for disjunctions\n   - use cases for case analysis\n\n6. Reflect on the proof structure:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the proof is complete and concise\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof of the theorem andOrDistrL, we need to focus on the right-to-left direction, which is currently marked with 'sorry'. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We're proving P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R → P ∧ (Q ∨ R), so we should start by introducing the hypothesis.\n\n2. Since the hypothesis is a disjunction, we need to use case analysis to handle both possibilities.\n\n3. In each case, we'll have a conjunction that we can split into its components.\n\n4. Our goal is to construct P ∧ (Q ∨ R) in both cases, which we can do using the components from step 3.\n\n5. For the Q case, we'll use Or.inl to prove Q ∨ R, and for the R case, we'll use Or.inr.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide for the acting agent:\n\n1. Start with 'intro h' to assume P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R.\n2. Use 'cases h with' to split into the two cases: P ∧ Q and P ∧ R.\n3. For each case:\n   a. Use 'cases' again to split the conjunction.\n   b. Use 'constructor' to start proving P ∧ (Q ∨ R).\n   c. For the first part of the constructor, use 'exact' with the appropriate hypothesis for P.\n   d. For the second part, use 'apply Or.inl' or 'apply Or.inr' as appropriate, then 'exact' with the Q or R hypothesis.\n\nThis approach should allow us to complete the proof without using 'sorry', fully demonstrating the bi-directional implication required for the theorem.\n",
