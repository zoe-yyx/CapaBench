Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q on type A\n   - It has a universal quantifier (∀) in the first premise\n   - The conclusion is a negation (¬)\n\n2. Identify the given premises:\n   - Premise 1: ∀ a : A, P a → Q a → False\n   - Premise 2: Q a0\n\n3. Identify the goal:\n   - Goal: ¬ P a0\n\n4. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the premises into the context\n   b. Expand the definition of negation (¬) in the goal\n   c. Assume P a0 (for contradiction)\n   d. Apply the universal quantifier (∀) from Premise 1 to a0\n   e. Use modus ponens twice:\n      - First with P a0 (our assumption)\n      - Then with Q a0 (from Premise 2)\n   f. Obtain False, completing the proof by contradiction\n\n5. Consider potential tactics:\n   - intro for introducing premises\n   - apply for using the universal quantifier\n   - exact for applying known facts\n   - contradiction for completing the proof\n\n6. Be prepared to unfold definitions if necessary, especially for negation (¬)\n\n7. Remember to use a0 specifically when applying the universal quantifier, as it's the element we're proving the statement for\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, our first step should be to introduce the premises into the context. This aligns with step 4a of our plan.\n\nThe theorem has two main premises:\n1. (∀ a : A, P a → Q a → False)\n2. Q a0\n\nAnd our goal is to prove: ¬ P a0\n\nTo start the proof, we should introduce these premises into our context. This will allow us to work with them in subsequent steps of the proof. \n\nAfter introducing the premises, we'll need to tackle the negation in our goal. In Lean 4, negation (¬ P) is defined as (P → False). So, our next step after introducing the premises should be to transform our goal ¬ P a0 into P a0 → False.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the acting agent to:\n1. Introduce the premises using the `intro` tactic.\n2. Transform the goal by expanding the definition of negation.\n\nThese steps will set up the proof environment for the subsequent steps in our plan.\n",
