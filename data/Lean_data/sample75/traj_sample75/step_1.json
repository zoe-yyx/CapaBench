    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is progressing as planned. We have successfully introduced the premises and expanded the definition of negation by assuming P a0. Now, we need to apply the universal quantifier from h1 to a0 and then use modus ponens twice to reach a contradiction.\n\nThe current goal is to prove False, which aligns with our plan to use proof by contradiction. We have all the necessary hypotheses in our context:\n\n1. h1 : ∀ (a : A), P a → Q a → False\n2. h2 : Q a0\n3. h3 : P a0\n\nThe next logical step is to apply h1 to a0, which will give us P a0 → Q a0 → False. Then we can use h3 (P a0) and h2 (Q a0) to derive False.\n\nTo accomplish this, we should use the 'apply' tactic with h1 a0, and then use 'exact' tactics to provide the required arguments.\n",
