    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for addComm Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that addition is commutative for natural numbers.\n   - The theorem states: add n m = add m n for any natural numbers n and m.\n\n2. Identify Available Tools:\n   - We have the definition of add function.\n   - We can use addZeroR and addSuccR theorems which are already proven.\n\n3. Choose Proof Strategy:\n   - Use induction on n, as the add function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n4. Outline Proof Steps:\n   a. Base case: Prove for n = 0\n      - Show: add 0 m = add m 0\n      - Use the definition of add and addZeroR theorem\n\n   b. Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for succ n\n      - Inductive hypothesis: add n m = add m n\n      - Show: add (succ n) m = add m (succ n)\n      - Use the definition of add and addSuccR theorem\n\n5. Key Points to Address:\n   - In the base case, focus on simplifying add 0 m and use addZeroR for add m 0.\n   - In the inductive step, use the inductive hypothesis and addSuccR strategically.\n   - Pay attention to the order of arguments in add function calls.\n\n6. Potential Challenges:\n   - Correctly applying the inductive hypothesis.\n   - Managing the succ function in the inductive step.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.\n   - Check that both the base case and inductive step are properly addressed.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the commutativity of addition in Lean 4, utilizing the given definitions and theorems.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo start proving the addComm theorem, we should follow the induction strategy outlined in the plan. Here's the reasoning for the first steps:\n\n1. Begin with induction on n:\n   - Use the 'induction n' tactic to set up the proof structure for both the base case and the inductive step.\n\n2. For the base case (n = 0):\n   - We need to prove: add 0 m = add m 0\n   - The left side (add 0 m) can be simplified using the definition of add.\n   - For the right side (add m 0), we can use the addZeroR theorem.\n\n3. For the inductive step:\n   - We'll have an inductive hypothesis: add n m = add m n\n   - We need to prove: add (succ n) m = add m (succ n)\n   - Use the definition of add to simplify the left side.\n   - Use the addSuccR theorem to rewrite the right side.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n, then focus on proving the base case by simplifying add 0 m and using the addZeroR theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof for the base case is incorrect due to a mismatch in the equality direction when using the addZeroR theorem.\n\nImprovement: Reverse the equality in the goal before applying the addZeroR theorem, or use a different tactic like 'rw' to apply addZeroR in the correct direction.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights two key points:\n\n1. The main issue in the current proof attempt is in the base case. The goal after simplification is \"m = add m 0\", but the addZeroR theorem is applied directly, which gives \"add m 0 = m\". This causes a type mismatch error.\n\n2. To improve the proof, we need to handle the equality correctly. There are two potential approaches:\n\n   a. We could use the 'rw' (rewrite) tactic instead of 'exact'. The 'rw' tactic can handle equalities in both directions.\n   \n   b. Alternatively, we could reverse the equality in our goal before applying the addZeroR theorem.\n\nFor the inductive step, while it's currently just a 'sorry' placeholder, the setup looks correct. The next actions should focus on completing this step using the inductive hypothesis and the addSuccR theorem.\n\nIn future iterations, it's important to pay close attention to the direction of equalities and use appropriate tactics that can handle these situations flexibly. This will help avoid similar type mismatches and make the proof process smoother.",
