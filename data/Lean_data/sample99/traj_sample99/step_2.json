    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for addComm Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove that addition is commutative for natural numbers.\n   - The theorem states: add n m = add m n for any natural numbers n and m.\n\n2. Identify Available Tools:\n   - We have the definition of add function.\n   - We can use addZeroR and addSuccR theorems which are already proven.\n\n3. Choose Proof Strategy:\n   - Use induction on n, as the add function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\n4. Outline Proof Steps:\n   a. Base case: Prove for n = 0\n      - Show: add 0 m = add m 0\n      - Use the definition of add and addZeroR theorem\n\n   b. Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for succ n\n      - Inductive hypothesis: add n m = add m n\n      - Show: add (succ n) m = add m (succ n)\n      - Use the definition of add and addSuccR theorem\n\n5. Key Points to Address:\n   - In the base case, focus on simplifying add 0 m and use addZeroR for add m 0.\n   - In the inductive step, use the inductive hypothesis and addSuccR strategically.\n   - Pay attention to the order of arguments in add function calls.\n\n6. Potential Challenges:\n   - Correctly applying the inductive hypothesis.\n   - Managing the succ function in the inductive step.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.\n   - Check that both the base case and inductive step are properly addressed.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the commutativity of addition in Lean 4, utilizing the given definitions and theorems.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation, it appears that the proof is nearly complete, but there is an unsolved goal in the base case. Let's focus on resolving this issue:\n\n1. In the base case (n = 0), we have simplified add 0 m to m, which is correct.\n2. We then used addZeroR to rewrite add m 0, but it seems this step didn't complete as expected.\n3. The current goal in the base case is: m = add (add m zero) 0\n\nTo resolve this, we need to:\n1. Apply addZeroR correctly to simplify add m 0 to m.\n2. Then, we should have m = m, which can be solved by reflexivity.\n\nFor the inductive step, the proof seems to be on the right track. After applying the inductive hypothesis, we just need to show that the resulting expressions are equal, which should be straightforward.\n\nReasoning for the next steps:\n1. In the base case, after simp [add], use rw [addZeroR m] to rewrite add m 0 to m.\n2. Then, use rfl to prove m = m.\n3. In the inductive step, after the current steps, use rfl to prove that the resulting expressions are equal.\n\nThis approach should complete the proof of the addComm theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof was complete, but the final rfl statements were unnecessary and caused errors.\n\nImprovement: Remove the final rfl statements in both the base case and inductive step, as the proof is already complete after the previous steps.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that the proof was actually successful, but the additional rfl statements at the end of both cases were superfluous and led to errors. This is because the goals were already solved by the previous steps.\n\nTo improve the proof:\n\n1. In the base case, after rw [addZeroR m], the goal is already solved. There's no need for the rfl statement.\n2. In the inductive step, after rw [ih], the goal is also solved. The final rfl is unnecessary.\n\nThese extra rfl statements are trying to prove goals that no longer exist, which is why we're seeing the \"no goals to be solved\" errors.\n\nFor future proofs:\n1. Pay close attention to the state of the goal after each tactic.\n2. Only use rfl or other closing tactics when there's an actual goal to prove.\n3. If a tactic solves the goal completely, don't add any further tactics for that case.\n\nBy making these adjustments, the proof should execute without errors and successfully prove the addComm theorem.",
