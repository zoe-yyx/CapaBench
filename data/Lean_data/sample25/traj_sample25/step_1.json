    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Note that `shift_up1` adds 1 to the result of f\n   - `func_plus` adds the results of two functions\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The goal is to prove that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)`\n   - This means we need to show these two functions produce the same output for all inputs\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use function extensionality:\n      - To prove two functions are equal, show they produce the same output for all inputs\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary input:\n      - Let x be an arbitrary integer\n   c. Expand definitions:\n      - Expand the left-hand side using the definition of `shift_up1`\n      - Expand the right-hand side using the definition of `func_plus`\n   d. Simplify and compare:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation\n      - Show that they are equivalent\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Start with `funext` to introduce an arbitrary input x\n   - Use `simp` or manually expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Show that both sides are equal using basic arithmetic\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - funext\n   - simp\n   - rw (rewrite)\n   - calc (for step-by-step calculations if needed)\n   - rfl (reflexivity, to prove trivial equalities)\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward, focusing on expanding definitions and basic function equality\n   - No advanced techniques or complex reasoning should be required\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the current state of the proof and the reflection on the previous attempt, we should modify our approach to be more explicit in showing the equality. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've already applied function extensionality with `funext x`, which was correct.\n\n2. The `simp [shift_up1, func_plus]` step partially expanded the definitions, but didn't complete the proof.\n\n3. To proceed, we need to fully expand the definitions and show the equality step-by-step. Here's how we can do this:\n\n   a. First, we should explicitly expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus` on both sides of the equation.\n   \n   b. Then, we can use the `calc` tactic to show the equality in a step-by-step manner. This will allow us to see each transformation clearly and ensure we're not missing any steps.\n\n4. The calc block should look something like this:\n   calc\n     shift_up1 f x = f x + 1 := by rfl\n     _ = f x + (fun _ => 1) x := by rfl\n     _ = func_plus f (fun _ => 1) x := by rfl\n\n5. Each step in the calc block should be justified, usually by using `rfl` for definitional equalities.\n\nBy following this approach, we'll explicitly show each step of the transformation, leaving no room for hidden assumptions or incomplete simplifications. This should resolve the issue we encountered in the previous attempt and complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure was correct, but the syntax for the calc block was incorrect, leading to a compilation error.\n\nImprovement: Adjust the calc block syntax by removing the `:=` after each line and replacing it with `=` to properly format the equalities in Lean 4.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that while the overall approach was correct, there was a syntax error in the calc block that prevented the proof from compiling. In Lean 4, the calc block syntax is slightly different from Lean 3, which caused the error.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Remove the `:=` after each line in the calc block and replace it with `=`.\n2. Keep the `by rfl` at the end of each line to justify the equality.\n3. Ensure that the indentation is correct for the calc block.\n\nThe corrected calc block should look like this:\n\n```lean\ncalc\n  shift_up1 f x = f x + 1 : by rfl\n  _ = f x + (fun _ => 1) x : by rfl\n  _ = func_plus f (fun _ => 1) x : by rfl\n```\n\nThis adjustment should resolve the syntax error and allow the proof to compile successfully. The overall structure and reasoning of the proof remain sound, and these changes should be sufficient to complete the proof of the target theorem.\n\nFor future proofs, we should be mindful of the specific syntax requirements in Lean 4, especially when using more complex tactics like calc. Always verify that the syntax matches the expectations of Lean 4, as there might be subtle differences from Lean 3 or other theorem provers.",
