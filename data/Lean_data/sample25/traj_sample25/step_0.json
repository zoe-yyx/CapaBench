Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Note that `shift_up1` adds 1 to the result of f\n   - `func_plus` adds the results of two functions\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The goal is to prove that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)`\n   - This means we need to show these two functions produce the same output for all inputs\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use function extensionality:\n      - To prove two functions are equal, show they produce the same output for all inputs\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary input:\n      - Let x be an arbitrary integer\n   c. Expand definitions:\n      - Expand the left-hand side using the definition of `shift_up1`\n      - Expand the right-hand side using the definition of `func_plus`\n   d. Simplify and compare:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation\n      - Show that they are equivalent\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Start with `funext` to introduce an arbitrary input x\n   - Use `simp` or manually expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Show that both sides are equal using basic arithmetic\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem shift_up1_eq, we need to show that the functions shift_up1 f and func_plus f (fun _ => 1) are equivalent for all inputs. The key steps in our reasoning are:\n\n1. Use function extensionality: We need to show that for any arbitrary input, both functions produce the same output. This suggests starting with the 'funext' tactic to introduce an arbitrary input x.\n\n2. Expand definitions: After introducing x, we should expand the definitions of shift_up1 and func_plus. This will allow us to see the explicit calculations performed by each function.\n\n3. Simplify expressions: Once the definitions are expanded, we'll have expressions that can be simplified. The left-hand side should simplify to f x + 1, and the right-hand side should simplify to f x + (fun _ => 1) x, which is equivalent to f x + 1.\n\n4. Prove equality: After simplification, both sides should be identical, allowing us to conclude the proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying the funext tactic to introduce an arbitrary input, then use simp or manual rewriting to expand the definitions and simplify the expressions. The proof should naturally follow from there, possibly concluding with reflexivity (rfl) if the expressions are obviously equal after simplification.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof failed because after simplification, the goal was not completely solved, leaving an unfinished equality.\n\nImprovement: Instead of using rfl after simp, we should explicitly show the equality by expanding the remaining definitions and simplifying the expressions on both sides of the equation.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that our approach was generally correct, but we made an incorrect assumption about the effectiveness of the simp tactic. The simp tactic did not fully reduce the expressions to a form where rfl could immediately prove their equality.\n\nTo improve our proving process, we should:\n\n1. After using funext and simp, explicitly expand any remaining definitions.\n2. Perform step-by-step simplification of both sides of the equation.\n3. Use tactics like rw or calc to show the equality more explicitly.\n\nFor the next iteration, the reasoning agent should consider breaking down the proof into more explicit steps, possibly using calc to show the equality step-by-step. The acting agent should then implement these steps, ensuring that each transformation is justified and leads to the final equality.\n\nThis approach will provide a more robust and transparent proof, addressing the issue we encountered with the incomplete simplification. It will also give us more control over each step of the proof, allowing us to catch and address any potential issues more easily.",
