    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Note that `shift_up1` adds 1 to the result of f\n   - `func_plus` adds the results of two functions\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The goal is to prove that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)`\n   - This means we need to show these two functions produce the same output for all inputs\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use function extensionality:\n      - To prove two functions are equal, show they produce the same output for all inputs\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary input:\n      - Let x be an arbitrary integer\n   c. Expand definitions:\n      - Expand the left-hand side using the definition of `shift_up1`\n      - Expand the right-hand side using the definition of `func_plus`\n   d. Simplify and compare:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation\n      - Show that they are equivalent\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Start with `funext` to introduce an arbitrary input x\n   - Use `simp` or manually expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Show that both sides are equal using basic arithmetic\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - funext\n   - simp\n   - rw (rewrite)\n   - calc (for step-by-step calculations if needed)\n   - rfl (reflexivity, to prove trivial equalities)\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward, focusing on expanding definitions and basic function equality\n   - No advanced techniques or complex reasoning should be required\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the next steps:\n\n1. The overall structure of the proof is correct, using function extensionality (funext) to introduce an arbitrary input x.\n\n2. The calc block is the right approach to show the equality step-by-step, but it needs syntactic adjustments for Lean 4.\n\n3. We should modify the calc block as follows:\n   - Remove the `:=` after each line and replace it with `=`\n   - Keep the `by rfl` at the end of each line to justify the equality\n   - Ensure proper indentation for the calc block\n\n4. The logical steps in the calc block are correct:\n   - First, we expand the definition of shift_up1\n   - Then, we show that (fun _ => 1) x is equivalent to 1\n   - Finally, we use the definition of func_plus\n\n5. After these adjustments, the proof should be complete and correct.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these syntactic changes while maintaining the logical structure of the proof. This should resolve the compilation error and successfully prove the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The calc block syntax is incorrect for Lean 4, causing a compilation error.\nImprovement: Remove the calc block entirely and use a direct chain of equalities with rw and simp tactics to prove the theorem step by step.\n```\n\nThe current approach using a calc block is causing issues in Lean 4. While calc blocks are useful in Lean 3, they are not as commonly used in Lean 4 proofs. Instead, we should restructure our proof to use a more straightforward approach with direct equality chains and Lean 4 tactics.\n\nTo improve our proving process, we should:\n\n1. Remove the calc block entirely.\n2. Use a sequence of rw (rewrite) tactics to expand definitions and simplify expressions.\n3. Utilize the simp tactic to handle simple computational steps.\n4. Maintain the use of funext at the beginning to introduce the arbitrary input x.\n\nThis approach will align better with Lean 4's syntax and should resolve the compilation error. It will also make the proof more readable and easier to maintain in the Lean 4 environment.\n\nFor the next action step, the acting agent should implement this new structure, starting with funext and then using a series of rw and simp tactics to prove the equality. This should lead to a successful and concise proof of the theorem.",
