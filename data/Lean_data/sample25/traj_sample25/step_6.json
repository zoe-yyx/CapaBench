    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Note that `shift_up1` adds 1 to the result of f\n   - `func_plus` adds the results of two functions\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The goal is to prove that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)`\n   - This means we need to show these two functions produce the same output for all inputs\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use function extensionality:\n      - To prove two functions are equal, show they produce the same output for all inputs\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary input:\n      - Let x be an arbitrary integer\n   c. Expand definitions:\n      - Expand the left-hand side using the definition of `shift_up1`\n      - Expand the right-hand side using the definition of `func_plus`\n   d. Simplify and compare:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation\n      - Show that they are equivalent\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Start with `funext` to introduce an arbitrary input x\n   - Use `simp` or manually expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Show that both sides are equal using basic arithmetic\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - funext\n   - simp\n   - rw (rewrite)\n   - calc (for step-by-step calculations if needed)\n   - rfl (reflexivity, to prove trivial equalities)\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward, focusing on expanding definitions and basic function equality\n   - No advanced techniques or complex reasoning should be required\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof strategy was correct, and the implementation was almost perfect. The error occurred because the goal was already solved after the simp tactic, but an additional rfl tactic was unnecessarily applied. Here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. The current proof structure is correct up to the simp tactic.\n2. After simp, both sides of the equation have been simplified to be identical, effectively proving the theorem.\n3. No further tactics are needed after simp in this case.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should:\n1. Keep the existing proof steps: funext x, unfold shift_up1, unfold func_plus, and simp.\n2. Remove the final rfl tactic.\n3. Ensure that the proof ends after the simp tactic.\n\nThis approach will provide a clear, step-by-step proof that demonstrates the equality of shift_up1 and func_plus for the given functions, leveraging Lean 4's powerful simp tactic to handle the final simplification and equality check.\n",
