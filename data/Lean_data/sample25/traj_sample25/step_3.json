    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Note that `shift_up1` adds 1 to the result of f\n   - `func_plus` adds the results of two functions\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The goal is to prove that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)`\n   - This means we need to show these two functions produce the same output for all inputs\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use function extensionality:\n      - To prove two functions are equal, show they produce the same output for all inputs\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary input:\n      - Let x be an arbitrary integer\n   c. Expand definitions:\n      - Expand the left-hand side using the definition of `shift_up1`\n      - Expand the right-hand side using the definition of `func_plus`\n   d. Simplify and compare:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation\n      - Show that they are equivalent\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Start with `funext` to introduce an arbitrary input x\n   - Use `simp` or manually expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Show that both sides are equal using basic arithmetic\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - funext\n   - simp\n   - rw (rewrite)\n   - calc (for step-by-step calculations if needed)\n   - rfl (reflexivity, to prove trivial equalities)\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward, focusing on expanding definitions and basic function equality\n   - No advanced techniques or complex reasoning should be required\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the reflection and the current state of the proof, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. We've already correctly started with `funext x` to introduce an arbitrary input. This is the right first step for proving function equality.\n\n2. Now, we need to expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus` on both sides of the equality. We can do this using the `rw` tactic.\n\n3. After expanding the definitions, we'll need to simplify the expressions. The `simp` tactic can be useful for this step.\n\n4. Finally, we may need to use `rfl` to prove that the simplified expressions are equal.\n\nThe general structure of the proof should look like this:\n\n1. `funext x` (already done)\n2. `rw [shift_up1, func_plus]` to expand both definitions\n3. `simp` to simplify the resulting expressions\n4. If needed, `rfl` to prove the final equality\n\nThis approach avoids the use of the `calc` block, which was causing issues in Lean 4, and instead relies on more straightforward tactics that are well-supported in Lean 4. This should resolve the compilation error and lead to a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to incorrect application of the `rw` tactic, which resolved the goal prematurely without completing the proof.\n\nImprovement: We should modify the `rw` tactic to only unfold the definitions partially, allowing us to complete the proof step by step.\n```\n\nThe current approach was close, but there were a few issues:\n\n1. The `rw` tactic was applied too broadly, which resolved the goal prematurely. This is why we received the \"no goals to be solved\" error.\n\n2. The `simp` and `rfl` tactics weren't executed because the goal was already resolved.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Be more specific with the `rw` tactic, only unfolding the definitions partially.\n\n2. After each step, we should check the state of the goal to ensure we're making progress without resolving it prematurely.\n\n3. Use `simp` only if necessary, and as the final step before `rfl`.\n\nA revised approach could look like this:\n\n1. Start with `funext x` (already correct)\n2. Use `rw [shift_up1]` to unfold only the `shift_up1` definition\n3. Use `rw [func_plus]` to unfold the `func_plus` definition\n4. If needed, use `simp` to simplify any remaining expressions\n5. Finish with `rfl` to prove the final equality\n\nThis step-by-step approach should allow us to complete the proof successfully while avoiding premature resolution of the goal.",
