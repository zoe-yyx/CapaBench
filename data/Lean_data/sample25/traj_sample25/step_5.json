    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Note that `shift_up1` adds 1 to the result of f\n   - `func_plus` adds the results of two functions\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The goal is to prove that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)`\n   - This means we need to show these two functions produce the same output for all inputs\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use function extensionality:\n      - To prove two functions are equal, show they produce the same output for all inputs\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary input:\n      - Let x be an arbitrary integer\n   c. Expand definitions:\n      - Expand the left-hand side using the definition of `shift_up1`\n      - Expand the right-hand side using the definition of `func_plus`\n   d. Simplify and compare:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation\n      - Show that they are equivalent\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Start with `funext` to introduce an arbitrary input x\n   - Use `simp` or manually expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Show that both sides are equal using basic arithmetic\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - funext\n   - simp\n   - rw (rewrite)\n   - calc (for step-by-step calculations if needed)\n   - rfl (reflexivity, to prove trivial equalities)\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward, focusing on expanding definitions and basic function equality\n   - No advanced techniques or complex reasoning should be required\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof attempt was on the right track but ended prematurely. Let's break down the proof into more explicit steps:\n\n1. We correctly started with `funext x` to introduce an arbitrary input x. This is a good first step when proving equality of functions.\n\n2. We then used `rw [shift_up1, func_plus]` to expand both definitions at once. While this is not incorrect, it might be more clear to expand these definitions one at a time to see the intermediate steps.\n\n3. Instead of using `simp` and `rfl`, which resolved the goal too quickly, we should explicitly show how the left-hand side equals the right-hand side.\n\nFor the next attempt, I suggest the following approach:\n\n1. Start with `funext x` as before.\n2. Use `unfold shift_up1` to expand only the left-hand side of the equation.\n3. Use `unfold func_plus` to expand the right-hand side of the equation.\n4. After these expansions, the goal should look something like:\n   `⊢ f x + 1 = f x + (fun _ => 1) x`\n5. Use `simp` to simplify `(fun _ => 1) x` to just `1`.\n6. At this point, both sides should be identical, and we can use `rfl` to complete the proof.\n\nThis approach will give us a clearer view of each step in the proof and ensure that we're not missing any important details.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof was correct up to the simp step, but the final rfl tactic was unnecessary and caused an error because the goal was already solved.\n\nImprovement: Remove the rfl tactic at the end of the proof, as the simp tactic has already solved the goal by simplifying both sides to be identical.\n```\n\nThe proof attempt was very close to being correct. Let's analyze what happened:\n\n1. The funext x step was correct, introducing an arbitrary input x.\n2. Unfolding shift_up1 and func_plus separately was a good approach, making each step clear.\n3. The simp tactic successfully simplified the right-hand side, making both sides identical.\n4. At this point, the goal was already solved, so the rfl tactic was unnecessary and caused an error.\n\nFor future proofs, we should keep in mind that simp is a powerful tactic that can often solve goals completely, especially when dealing with function definitions and simple arithmetic. After using simp, it's good practice to check if the goal has been solved before applying additional tactics.\n\nIn this case, the proof is complete after the simp step. For the next attempt, we should simply remove the rfl tactic at the end. This will result in a clean, step-by-step proof that clearly demonstrates the equality of shift_up1 and func_plus for the given functions.",
