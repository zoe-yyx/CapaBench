    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Note that `shift_up1` adds 1 to the result of f\n   - `func_plus` adds the results of two functions\n\n2. Analyze the theorem statement:\n   - The goal is to prove that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)`\n   - This means we need to show these two functions produce the same output for all inputs\n\n3. Proof strategy:\n   a. Use function extensionality:\n      - To prove two functions are equal, show they produce the same output for all inputs\n   b. Introduce an arbitrary input:\n      - Let x be an arbitrary integer\n   c. Expand definitions:\n      - Expand the left-hand side using the definition of `shift_up1`\n      - Expand the right-hand side using the definition of `func_plus`\n   d. Simplify and compare:\n      - Simplify both sides of the equation\n      - Show that they are equivalent\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   - Start with `funext` to introduce an arbitrary input x\n   - Use `simp` or manually expand the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`\n   - Simplify the resulting expressions\n   - Show that both sides are equal using basic arithmetic\n\n5. Possible tactics to use:\n   - funext\n   - simp\n   - rw (rewrite)\n   - calc (for step-by-step calculations if needed)\n   - rfl (reflexivity, to prove trivial equalities)\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward, focusing on expanding definitions and basic function equality\n   - No advanced techniques or complex reasoning should be required\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We've correctly started with `funext x` to introduce an arbitrary input.\n\n2. Our next step should be to unfold the definitions carefully, one at a time. Let's start with `shift_up1`:\n\n   rw [shift_up1]\n\n   This will expand the left-hand side of our equation.\n\n3. After that, we should unfold `func_plus`:\n\n   rw [func_plus]\n\n   This will expand the right-hand side of our equation.\n\n4. At this point, both sides of the equation should be fully expanded. We might need to use `simp` to simplify any remaining expressions, but it's possible that the equality will be obvious after the expansions.\n\n5. Finally, we can use `rfl` to prove the resulting trivial equality.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to complete the proof without prematurely resolving the goal. Remember to check the state of the goal after each step to ensure we're making progress and to adjust our approach if needed.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt prematurely resolved the goal after expanding definitions, leaving no further goals to be solved.\n\nImprovement: We should avoid using `simp` and `rfl` at the end, and instead focus on carefully expanding definitions and comparing the resulting expressions step by step.\n```\n\nThe current approach was close, but it resolved the goal too quickly without giving us a chance to see the intermediate steps and ensure that each part of the proof was correct. \n\nTo improve our next attempt, we should:\n\n1. Start with `funext x` as we did before, which was correct.\n2. Expand the definitions one at a time, using `rw` or `unfold` tactics.\n3. After each expansion, we should check the state of the goal to understand what we're working with.\n4. Instead of using `simp` and `rfl` at the end, we should compare the left and right sides of the equation manually, ensuring that they are indeed equal.\n5. If the equality is not immediately obvious after expanding definitions, we may need to perform some algebraic manipulations or use additional tactics to show the equality.\n\nBy taking a more deliberate, step-by-step approach, we can ensure that we understand each part of the proof and avoid prematurely resolving the goal. This will give us more control over the proof process and help us identify any potential issues more easily.",
