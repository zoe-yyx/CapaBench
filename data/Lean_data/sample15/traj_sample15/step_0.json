    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem 'shift_up1_square', we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by unfolding the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square'. This will allow us to see the explicit expressions we're working with.\n\n2. The left-hand side of the equation, 'shift_up1 square x', can be expanded using the definition of 'shift_up1'.\n\n3. Once expanded, we can then substitute the definition of 'square' into this expression.\n\n4. After these substitutions, we should have an expression that matches the right-hand side of the equation we're trying to prove.\n\n5. The proof can likely be completed in a single step using the 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to unfold the definitions, followed by 'rfl' to prove equality by reflexivity.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by using the 'rw' tactic to unfold the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square'. This will set up the proof for completion with 'rfl'.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt was incomplete as it did not fully expand the left-hand side of the equation before applying 'rfl'.\n\nImprovement: We should modify the 'rw' tactic to unfold 'shift_up1' and 'square' in the correct order, then use 'simp' to simplify the resulting expression before applying 'rfl'.\n```\n\nThe current approach was on the right track, but it fell short in fully expanding and simplifying the left-hand side of the equation. The 'rw' tactic was used correctly to unfold the definitions, but the order of unfolding and the lack of simplification led to an incomplete proof.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Use 'rw' to unfold 'shift_up1' first, as it's the outermost function.\n2. Then unfold 'square' within the context of 'shift_up1'.\n3. Use the 'simp' tactic to simplify the resulting expression.\n4. Finally, apply 'rfl' to prove equality by reflexivity.\n\nThis approach should fully expand the left-hand side of the equation to match the right-hand side, allowing for a successful proof. The acting agent should implement these steps in the next attempt, ensuring each step is applied in the correct order.",
