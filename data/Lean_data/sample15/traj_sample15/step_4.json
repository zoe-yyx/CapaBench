Break Down the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of 'square': square x = x * x\n   - Analyze the definition of 'shift_up1': shift_up1 f x = f x + 1\n\n3. Combine the Definitions:\n   - Apply 'shift_up1' to 'square':\n     shift_up1 square x = square x + 1\n\n4. Expand the Proof:\n   - Start with the left side of the equation: shift_up1 square x\n   - Substitute the definition of shift_up1\n   - Substitute the definition of square\n   - Simplify to reach the right side of the equation: x * x + 1\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, and we've successfully unfolded the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square' using the 'rw' tactic. The current goal state shows:\n\nx : ℤ\n⊢ square x + 1 = x * x + 1\n\nThis goal is actually already solved because both sides of the equation are identical. The left side 'square x + 1' is equivalent to 'x * x + 1' after unfolding the 'square' definition, which is exactly the right side of the equation.\n\nAt this point, we don't need to apply any further simplification tactics like 'simp'. Instead, we can directly prove the equality using the 'rfl' (reflexivity) tactic. The 'rfl' tactic is used to prove goals of the form 'a = a', which is exactly what we have after the rewrites.\n\nTherefore, the next and final step should be to apply the 'rfl' tactic to complete the proof. This will demonstrate that both sides of the equation are definitionally equal, thus proving the theorem 'shift_up1_square'.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof was correct and complete, but the 'rfl' tactic was unnecessary and caused an error because the goal was already solved.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'rfl' tactic and end the proof after the two 'rw' steps, as the goal is automatically discharged when both sides of the equation become identical.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the proving process was actually correct up until the last step. The two 'rw' tactics successfully unfolded the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square', resulting in an equation where both sides were identical (x * x + 1 = x * x + 1). At this point, Lean automatically recognizes this as a proof and discharges the goal.\n\nThe error occurred because we tried to apply 'rfl' when there were no more goals to prove. This is why we got the \"no goals to be solved\" error message.\n\nFor future proofs, it's important to recognize when a goal has been automatically discharged. In cases where rewriting results in identical terms on both sides of an equation, no further tactics are needed. The proof can be considered complete at that point.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Be more attentive to the state of the proof after each tactic application.\n2. Recognize when a goal has been automatically discharged.\n3. Avoid applying unnecessary tactics after the proof is complete.\n\nThese insights will help streamline future proofs and avoid errors caused by superfluous tactics.",
