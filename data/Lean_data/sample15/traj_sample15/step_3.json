Break Down the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of 'square': square x = x * x\n   - Analyze the definition of 'shift_up1': shift_up1 f x = f x + 1\n\n3. Combine the Definitions:\n   - Apply 'shift_up1' to 'square':\n     shift_up1 square x = square x + 1\n\n4. Expand the Proof:\n   - Start with the left side of the equation: shift_up1 square x\n   - Substitute the definition of shift_up1\n   - Substitute the definition of square\n   - Simplify to reach the right side of the equation: x * x + 1\n\n5. Use Lean 4 Tactics:\n   - Begin with 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to unfold definitions\n   - Use 'simp' tactic for simplification if needed\n   - Finish with 'rfl' tactic to prove equality by reflexivity\n\n6. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that the final result matches the theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is very close to completion. We have successfully unfolded the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square' using the 'rw' tactic. The current goal state is:\n\n⊢ square x + 1 = x * x + 1\n\nThis is exactly what we need to prove, but we need one final step to complete the proof. The left-hand side 'square x' is equivalent to 'x * x' by definition, but this last simplification step needs to be performed.\n\nTo complete the proof, we should use the 'simp' tactic. This tactic will simplify the expression 'square x' to 'x * x' based on its definition, and then the equality will be trivial.\n\nIf 'simp' doesn't work for any reason, we can alternatively use 'rfl' at this point. The 'rfl' tactic should recognize that 'square x' and 'x * x' are definitionally equal and prove the goal.\n\nEither of these tactics should successfully complete the proof without any errors.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof was almost complete, but the final 'simp' tactic caused an error because the goal was already solved after the previous 'rw' steps.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'simp' tactic and end the proof with 'rfl' after the two 'rw' steps to complete the proof without errors.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that our proof strategy was correct up until the final step. The 'rw' tactics successfully unfolded the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square', bringing the goal to a state where it was actually already solved. The error occurred because we tried to apply 'simp' when there were \"no goals to be solved\".\n\nTo improve the proving process, we should recognize when a goal is fully simplified and ready to be closed with 'rfl'. In this case, after applying the two 'rw' tactics, the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation were already identical, making the goal trivially true.\n\nFor future proofs, we should:\n1. Pay closer attention to the state of the goal after each tactic application.\n2. Use 'rfl' to close goals when the sides of an equation are definitionally equal.\n3. Avoid applying unnecessary tactics that might cause errors when the goal is already solved.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we can ensure a more efficient and error-free proving process in future theorem proofs.",
