Combine the Definitions:\n   - Apply 'shift_up1' to 'square':\n     shift_up1 square x = square x + 1\n\n4.

    "reasoning": "\n1. Start by using the 'rw' tactic to unfold the definition of 'shift_up1'. This will expand the outermost function first.\n\n2. Then, within the context of the expanded 'shift_up1', use 'rw' again to unfold the definition of 'square'. This will fully expand the left-hand side of the equation.\n\n3. After expanding both definitions, use the 'simp' tactic to simplify the resulting expression. This step will help in reducing the expanded form to a more manageable expression.\n\n4. Finally, apply the 'rfl' tactic to prove equality by reflexivity. At this point, both sides of the equation should be identical, allowing 'rfl' to complete the proof.\n\nThese steps should be applied in this specific order to ensure that the left-hand side of the equation is fully expanded and simplified to match the right-hand side, thus completing the proof of the theorem 'shift_up1_square'.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempts to use 'rw' tactic on both 'shift_up1' and 'square' simultaneously, which is incorrect and leads to an error.\n\nImprovement: Apply 'rw' tactic separately for 'shift_up1' and 'square', then use 'simp' or 'rfl' to complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe current approach encountered an error because it attempted to rewrite both 'shift_up1' and 'square' definitions in a single 'rw' tactic call. This is not the correct way to unfold these definitions in Lean 4.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Use 'rw' tactic to unfold 'shift_up1' definition first.\n2. Then, use another 'rw' tactic to unfold 'square' definition.\n3. After unfolding both definitions, the goal should match the right-hand side of the equation.\n4. Use 'rfl' tactic to complete the proof by reflexivity, or 'simp' if any simplification is needed.\n\nThis step-by-step approach will ensure that each definition is properly expanded and the proof progresses correctly. It's important to remember that in Lean 4, tactics often need to be applied one at a time for precise control over the proof state.\n\nFor future actions, the LLM agent should focus on applying tactics individually and checking the proof state after each step. This methodical approach will help in identifying and resolving issues more effectively.",
