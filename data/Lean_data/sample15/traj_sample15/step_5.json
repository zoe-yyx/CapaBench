    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove the theorem 'shift_up1_square'.\n   - We need to show that for any integer x, shift_up1 square x = x * x + 1.\n\n2. Break Down the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of 'square': square x = x * x\n   - Analyze the definition of 'shift_up1': shift_up1 f x = f x + 1\n\n3. Combine the Definitions:\n   - Apply 'shift_up1' to 'square':\n     shift_up1 square x = square x + 1\n\n4. Expand the Proof:\n   - Start with the left side of the equation: shift_up1 square x\n   - Substitute the definition of shift_up1\n   - Substitute the definition of square\n   - Simplify to reach the right side of the equation: x * x + 1\n\n5. Use Lean 4 Tactics:\n   - Begin with 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to unfold definitions\n   - Use 'simp' tactic for simplification if needed\n   - Finish with 'rfl' tactic to prove equality by reflexivity\n\n6. Verify the Proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that the final result matches the theorem statement\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is actually complete after the two 'rw' tactics. Here's why:\n\n1. The first 'rw [shift_up1]' expands the definition of shift_up1, transforming the goal to:\n   ⊢ square x + 1 = x * x + 1\n\n2. The second 'rw [square]' expands the definition of square, resulting in:\n   ⊢ (x * x) + 1 = x * x + 1\n\nAt this point, both sides of the equation are identical, and Lean automatically recognizes this as a proof. There's no need for any additional tactics.\n\nThe 'rfl' tactic at the end was unnecessary and caused an error because there were no more goals to prove. To fix this, we should simply remove the 'rfl' tactic.\n\nThe complete and correct proof should be:\n\ntheorem shift_up1_square (x : ℤ) : shift_up1 square x = x * x + 1 := by\n  rw [shift_up1]\n  rw [square]\n\nThis proof is sufficient to prove the theorem. After these two rewrites, Lean will automatically discharge the goal as the equation becomes trivially true.\n",
