Break Down the Definitions:\n   - Analyze the definition of 'square': square x = x * x\n   - Analyze the definition of 'shift_up1': shift_up1 f x = f x + 1\n\n3. Combine the Definitions:\n   - Apply 'shift_up1' to 'square':\n     shift_up1 square x = square x + 1\n\n4. Expand the Proof:\n   - Start with the left side of the equation: shift_up1 square x\n   - Substitute the definition of shift_up1\n   - Substitute the definition of square\n   - Simplify to reach the right side of the equation: x * x + 1\n\n5. Use Lean 4 Tactics:\n   - Begin with 'rw' (rewrite) tactic to unfold definitions\n   - Use 'simp' tactic for simplification if needed\n   - Finish with 'rfl' tactic to prove equality by reflexivity\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem 'shift_up1_square', we need to unfold the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square' separately, and then show that the resulting expression equals x * x + 1. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. First, we should use the 'rw' tactic to unfold the definition of 'shift_up1'. This will replace 'shift_up1 square x' with 'square x + 1'.\n\n2. After that, we should use another 'rw' tactic to unfold the definition of 'square'. This will replace 'square x' with 'x * x'.\n\n3. At this point, the goal should look like: '(x * x) + 1 = x * x + 1'.\n\n4. Since the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation are now identical, we can use the 'rfl' tactic to prove equality by reflexivity.\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensures that we unfold each definition separately and then prove the resulting equality, which should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof was partially successful but failed to complete due to an unnecessary 'rfl' tactic at the end.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'rfl' tactic and instead use 'simp' or 'rfl' after the two 'rw' steps to complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe proof was on the right track with the use of 'rw' tactics to unfold the definitions of 'shift_up1' and 'square'. However, after these steps, the goal state became 'square x + 1 = x * x + 1', which still required one more simplification step.\n\nThe error message \"no goals to be solved\" suggests that the 'rfl' tactic was applied when there was still a goal to prove. This indicates that the proof was not fully completed at that point.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Keep the first two 'rw' steps as they are correct and necessary.\n2. After the 'rw' steps, use either 'simp' to simplify the remaining expression or 'rfl' to prove the equality. Both should work in this case as the expressions are now equivalent.\n\nThis adjustment should lead to a successful completion of the proof without any errors.",
