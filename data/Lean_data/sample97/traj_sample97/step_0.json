    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that for any natural number n, adding zero to the right side of n is equal to n itself.\n   - The theorem is named 'add_zero_right'.\n\n2. Analyze the add function:\n   - The add function is defined recursively.\n   - It has two cases: one for when the first argument is zero, and one for when it's a successor.\n\n3. Use induction on n:\n   - Since we're dealing with natural numbers and a recursive function, induction is likely the best approach.\n   - We'll need to prove the base case (n = 0) and the inductive step.\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   a. Start with induction on n\n   b. Base case: Prove add 0 0 = 0\n   c. Inductive step: \n      - Assume the theorem holds for some k (induction hypothesis)\n      - Prove it holds for (k + 1)\n\n5. Expected challenges:\n   - In the inductive step, we'll need to unfold the definition of add for the successor case.\n   - We may need to use the induction hypothesis cleverly.\n\n6. Possible tactics to use:\n   - induction for starting the inductive proof\n   - rfl for reflexivity (proving equality by definition)\n   - simp for simplification\n   - rw for rewriting using known equalities\n\n7. Final step:\n   - Once both cases are proved, the induction principle will complete the proof for all natural numbers.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem add_zero_right, we should follow the induction strategy outlined in the plan. The first step is to apply induction on the natural number n. This will set up our proof structure with two cases: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nReasoning for the next action:\n1. Start the proof by applying induction on n. This will create two goals:\n   - Base case: Prove add Nat.zero Nat.zero = Nat.zero\n   - Inductive step: Prove add (Nat.succ n) Nat.zero = Nat.succ n, \n     assuming add n Nat.zero = n (induction hypothesis)\n\n2. For the base case, we should be able to use the definition of add directly. When the first argument is Nat.zero, add simply returns the second argument, which is also Nat.zero in this case.\n\n3. For the inductive step, we'll need to unfold the definition of add for the successor case and then use the induction hypothesis.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying induction on n. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof and allow us to tackle each case separately.\n",
