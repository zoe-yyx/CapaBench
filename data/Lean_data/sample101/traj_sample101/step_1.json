    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any natural numbers n, m, and p, p + n = p + m if and only if n = m.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (↔), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `constructor` tactic to split the proof into two directions:\n     a) (→) If p + n = p + m, then n = m\n     b) (←) If n = m, then p + n = p + m\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume p + n = p + m\n   - Use the cancellation property of addition for natural numbers\n   - This may require induction on p or using a built-in lemma\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume n = m\n   - Substitute n with m in the left side of the equation\n   - Use the reflexivity property of equality\n\n5. Consider using helpful tactics:\n   - `intro` for introducing hypotheses\n   - `rw` for rewriting equations\n   - `simp` for simplifying expressions\n   - `exact` for providing direct proofs\n\n6. Reflect on potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring the correct use of the cancellation property for natural numbers\n   - Handling the bidirectional implication correctly\n\n7. Be prepared to use any relevant theorems or lemmas from the Nat library, such as:\n   - add_left_cancel\n   - add_right_cancel\n   - add_left_inj\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The overall structure of the proof using `constructor` to split into two directions is correct and should be maintained.\n\n2. For the forward direction (→), we need to correct the application of `Nat.add_left_cancel`. Instead of applying it as a tactic, we should use it as a function to prove the equality. \n\n3. The correct usage of `Nat.add_left_cancel` should be:\n   `exact Nat.add_left_cancel h`\n   \n   This uses `Nat.add_left_cancel` as a function that takes our hypothesis `h` (which states `p + n = p + m`) and produces the desired conclusion (`n = m`).\n\n4. The backward direction (←) is already correct and doesn't need modification.\n\n5. The complete proof structure should look like this:\n   \n   constructor\n   · intro h\n     exact Nat.add_left_cancel h\n   · intro h\n     rw [h]\n\n6. This correction should resolve the type mismatch error and allow the proof to proceed correctly.\n\n7. After making this change, the proof should be complete, as both directions of the bidirectional implication will be properly addressed.\n",
