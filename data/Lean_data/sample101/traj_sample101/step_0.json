Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any natural numbers n, m, and p, p + n = p + m if and only if n = m.\n   - This is a bidirectional implication (↔), so we need to prove both directions.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `constructor` tactic to split the proof into two directions:\n     a) (→) If p + n = p + m, then n = m\n     b) (←) If n = m, then p + n = p + m\n\n3. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Assume p + n = p + m\n   - Use the cancellation property of addition for natural numbers\n   - This may require induction on p or using a built-in lemma\n\n4. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Assume n = m\n   - Substitute n with m in the left side of the equation\n   - Use the reflexivity property of equality\n\n5. Consider using helpful tactics:\n   - `intro` for introducing hypotheses\n   - `rw` for rewriting equations\n   - `simp` for simplifying expressions\n   - `exact` for providing direct proofs\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem add_cancel_left, we should follow the structure outlined in the planning strategy. Since we're at the start of the proof, our first step should be to set up the basic structure of the bidirectional implication.\n\n1. Use the `constructor` tactic to split the proof into two directions. This will create two subgoals, one for each direction of the implication.\n\n2. For the forward direction (→):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis using the `intro` tactic. This will give us an assumption that p + n = p + m.\n   b. We'll need to use the cancellation property of addition for natural numbers. In Lean 4, we can likely use the `add_left_cancel` theorem from the Nat library.\n   c. Apply the `add_left_cancel` theorem using the `apply` tactic.\n\n3. For the backward direction (←):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis that n = m using the `intro` tactic.\n   b. Use the `rw` (rewrite) tactic to substitute n with m in the left side of the equation.\n   c. The goal should then be trivially true, which can be solved with the `rfl` tactic for reflexivity.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by applying the `constructor` tactic to set up the two directions of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The application of Nat.add_left_cancel was incorrect, as it doesn't match the expected type for the current goal.\n\nImprovement: We should use Nat.add_left_cancel as a function to prove equality, not as a direct tactic application, and ensure we're using it with the correct arguments.\n```\n\nThe reflection reveals that our approach was generally correct, but we made a mistake in how we applied the Nat.add_left_cancel theorem. This theorem is not a tactic that can be directly applied, but rather a function that we need to use to prove the equality.\n\nTo improve our proof, we should:\n\n1. Keep the overall structure of the proof, which was correct (using constructor to split into two cases).\n\n2. In the forward direction (→), instead of directly applying Nat.add_left_cancel, we should use it as a function. The correct usage would be something like:\n   `exact Nat.add_left_cancel h`\n   \n   This uses Nat.add_left_cancel as a function that takes our hypothesis h (which states p + n = p + m) and produces the desired conclusion (n = m).\n\n3. The backward direction (←) was correct and doesn't need modification.\n\nFor the next iteration, the acting agent should implement this correction in the forward direction of the proof. This should resolve the type mismatch error and allow the proof to proceed correctly.",
