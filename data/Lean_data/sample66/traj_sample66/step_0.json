Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an if and only if (↔) statement\n   - The left side is a negation of a disjunction: ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - The right side is a conjunction of negations: ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the proof into two implications\n   - Prove the forward direction: ¬ (P ∨ Q) → ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Prove the backward direction: ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Use contradiction to prove ¬ P and ¬ Q separately\n   - Combine the results to form ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Use contradiction to prove ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Assume P ∨ Q and derive a contradiction using the hypothesis\n\n5. Utilize Lean 4 tactics:\n   - Use `intro` to introduce hypotheses\n   - Use `apply And.intro` to prove conjunctions\n   - Use `apply Or.elim` to eliminate disjunctions\n   - Use `contradiction` or `exact` to derive contradictions\n\n6. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the logic is sound and complete\n   - Check that all steps are properly justified\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem notOrIff (P Q : Prop) : ¬ (P ∨ Q) ↔ ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q, we should follow the planned structure:\n\n1. Start by applying the Iff.intro tactic to split the proof into two implications. This will create two subgoals: the forward direction and the backward direction.\n\n2. For the forward direction (¬ (P ∨ Q) → ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   b. To prove ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q, we need to show both ¬ P and ¬ Q separately\n   c. For each part, use contradiction:\n      - Assume P (or Q) and derive a contradiction using the hypothesis ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   d. After proving both ¬ P and ¬ Q, combine them using And.intro\n\n3. For the backward direction (¬ P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∨ Q)):\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n   b. To prove ¬ (P ∨ Q), use contradiction:\n      - Assume P ∨ Q\n      - Use Or.elim to consider both cases (P and Q)\n      - In each case, derive a contradiction using the appropriate part of the hypothesis\n\nThe acting agent should start by applying the Iff.intro tactic to set up the structure of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete and relies on 'sorry' for both directions of the iff statement, failing to provide a rigorous demonstration of the theorem.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'sorry' statements with detailed proof steps for both the forward and backward directions, using tactics like 'intro', 'apply', and 'cases' to break down the logical structure and prove each part systematically.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure is correct in applying Iff.intro to split the theorem into two directions. However, the use of 'sorry' for both directions means that no actual proving has been done. To improve:\n\n1. For the forward direction (¬ (P ∨ Q) → ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q):\n   - Use 'intro' to assume ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Apply 'apply And.intro' to split the goal into two parts: ¬P and ¯Q\n   - For each part, use 'apply not_intro' and then 'intro' to set up a proof by contradiction\n   - Use 'apply absurd' with the appropriate hypothesis to derive the contradiction\n\n2. For the backward direction (¬ P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∨ Q)):\n   - Use 'intro' to assume ¬ P ∧ ¯Q\n   - Apply 'apply not_intro' to set up a proof by contradiction for ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Use 'cases' on the disjunction P ∨ Q\n   - For each case, apply the corresponding part of the hypothesis to derive a contradiction\n\nBy implementing these steps, we can provide a complete and rigorous proof of the theorem without relying on 'sorry'. The acting agent should focus on implementing these detailed proof steps in the next iteration.",
