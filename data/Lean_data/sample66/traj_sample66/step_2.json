    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an if and only if (↔) statement\n   - The left side is a negation of a disjunction: ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - The right side is a conjunction of negations: ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the proof into two implications\n   - Prove the forward direction: ¬ (P ∨ Q) → ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Prove the backward direction: ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Use contradiction to prove ¬ P and ¬ Q separately\n   - Combine the results to form ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Use contradiction to prove ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Assume P ∨ Q and derive a contradiction using the hypothesis\n\n5. Utilize Lean 4 tactics:\n   - Use `intro` to introduce hypotheses\n   - Use `apply And.intro` to prove conjunctions\n   - Use `apply Or.elim` to eliminate disjunctions\n   - Use `contradiction` or `exact` to derive contradictions\n\n6. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the logic is sound and complete\n   - Check that all steps are properly justified\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. For the forward direction (¬ (P ∨ Q) → ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q):\n   - The structure is correct, but we need to replace 'not_intro' with the correct Lean 4 syntax.\n   - For each part of the conjunction (¬P and ¬Q), we should:\n     a. Use 'intro' to assume the positive case (P or Q)\n     b. Apply the hypothesis h to derive a contradiction\n   - This approach will prove both ¬P and ¬Q, which can then be combined with And.intro\n\n2. For the backward direction (¬ P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∨ Q)):\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (¬P ∧ ¬Q)\n   - Then, prove ¬(P ∨ Q) by contradiction:\n     a. Assume (P ∨ Q)\n     b. Use Or.elim to consider both cases (P and Q)\n     c. In each case, derive a contradiction using the appropriate part of the hypothesis\n   - This will complete the proof of the backward direction\n\n3. General advice:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce hypotheses and assumptions\n   - Use 'apply' or 'exact' to use hypotheses or proven facts\n   - Use 'contradiction' when you have both a proposition and its negation in the context\n\nBy following this reasoning, we should be able to complete the proof using correct Lean 4 syntax and tactics.\n",
