    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is an if and only if (↔) statement\n   - The left side is a negation of a disjunction: ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - The right side is a conjunction of negations: ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the proof into two implications\n   - Prove the forward direction: ¬ (P ∨ Q) → ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Prove the backward direction: ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q → ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n\n3. Forward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Use contradiction to prove ¬ P and ¬ Q separately\n   - Combine the results to form ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n\n4. Backward direction strategy:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q\n   - Use contradiction to prove ¬ (P ∨ Q)\n   - Assume P ∨ Q and derive a contradiction using the hypothesis\n\n5. Utilize Lean 4 tactics:\n   - Use `intro` to introduce hypotheses\n   - Use `apply And.intro` to prove conjunctions\n   - Use `apply Or.elim` to eliminate disjunctions\n   - Use `contradiction` or `exact` to derive contradictions\n\n6. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the logic is sound and complete\n   - Check that all steps are properly justified\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the forward direction (¬ (P ∨ Q) → ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q):\n\n1. Start by introducing the hypothesis ¬ (P ∨ Q):\n   intro h\n\n2. Apply And.intro to split the goal into two parts:\n   apply And.intro\n\n3. For the first part (¬P):\n   · apply not_intro\n     intro p\n     apply h\n     apply Or.inl\n     exact p\n\n4. For the second part (¬Q):\n   · apply not_intro\n     intro q\n     apply h\n     apply Or.inr\n     exact q\n\nThis approach will prove the forward direction by contradiction. We assume ¬ (P ∨ Q), and then prove ¬P and ¬Q separately. For each part, we show that assuming P (or Q) leads to a contradiction with our initial assumption ¬ (P ∨ Q).\n\nAfter completing the forward direction, the acting agent should move on to the backward direction in the next iteration.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current outcome:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof uses 'not_intro', which is not a recognized tactic in Lean 4, causing errors in the proving process.\nImprovement: Replace 'not_intro' with the correct Lean 4 syntax for introducing negation, such as using 'intro' followed by 'apply absurd' or 'contradiction'.\n```\n\nThe current approach is on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The use of 'not_intro' is incorrect in Lean 4. This tactic doesn't exist in Lean 4, which is why we're seeing errors.\n\n2. The structure of the proof is correct, but the implementation needs to be adjusted to use Lean 4 syntax and tactics.\n\n3. The backward direction is currently using 'sorry', which needs to be replaced with a proper proof.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Replace 'not_intro' with the correct Lean 4 syntax for introducing negation. This typically involves using 'intro' to introduce the assumption and then using 'apply absurd' or 'contradiction' to derive a contradiction.\n\n2. Complete the backward direction of the proof using similar logic to the forward direction, but adapted for the reverse implication.\n\n3. Ensure that all tactics and syntax used are compatible with Lean 4.\n\n4. Break down complex steps into smaller, more manageable parts if necessary.\n\nIn the next iteration, the reasoning and acting agents should focus on implementing these improvements, particularly addressing the negation introduction and completing the backward direction of the proof.",
