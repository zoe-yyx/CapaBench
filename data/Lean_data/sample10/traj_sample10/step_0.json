After rewriting, we'll have an arithmetic expression that needs to be simplified.\n\n3. Use norm_num to simplify the arithmetic expression and prove the equality automatically.\n\nThese steps align with the planning strategy and should be sufficient to prove the theorem. The acting agent should begin by using the 'rw' tactic to rewrite the definition of smul, followed by the 'norm_num' tactic to simplify and prove the resulting arithmetic equality.\n",
