Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove the theorem addSuccR: add n (succ m) = succ (add n m)\n   - This involves the custom 'add' function defined for natural numbers\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use induction on 'n' as the 'add' function is defined recursively on its first argument\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Base case: n = zero\n      - Show: add zero (succ m) = succ (add zero m)\n   \n   b. Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for succ n\n      - Inductive hypothesis: add n (succ m) = succ (add n m)\n      - Show: add (succ n) (succ m) = succ (add (succ n) m)\n\n4. Proof strategy:\n   - Start with induction on 'n'\n   - For the base case, use the definition of 'add'\n   - For the inductive step:\n     * Expand the left-hand side using the definition of 'add'\n     * Use the inductive hypothesis\n     * Apply equality reasoning\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - induction n\n   - rfl (for reflexivity)\n   - simp (for simplification)\n   - rw (for rewriting)\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Correctly applying the inductive hypothesis\n   - Managing the nested successor functions\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure each step of the proof is justified\n   - Check that both the base case and inductive step are completed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the planned approach of using induction on 'n'. This is because the 'add' function is defined recursively on its first argument.\n\nThe reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. We need to prove the theorem for all natural numbers 'n', and the structure of 'add' suggests that induction on 'n' will be effective.\n\n2. Using induction will split our proof into two cases: the base case (n = zero) and the inductive step (assuming the theorem holds for n, prove it for succ n).\n\n3. This approach aligns with the recursive definition of 'add' and will allow us to leverage its structure in our proof.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start the proof by applying induction on 'n'. This will set up the framework for the rest of the proof, allowing us to tackle both the base case and the inductive step separately.\n",
