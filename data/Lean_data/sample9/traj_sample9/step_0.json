Break down the proof:\n   - Expand the definition of 'square 5'\n   - Perform the multiplication 5 * 5\n   - Show that the result equals 25\n\n3. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'rw' (rewrite) to unfold the definition of 'square'\n   - Use 'simp' to simplify the multiplication\n   - Alternatively, use 'rfl' (reflexivity) if Lean can automatically recognize that 5 * 5 = 25\n\n4. Proof outline:\n   a. Start with the goal 'square 5 = 25'\n   b. Rewrite using the definition of 'square'\n   c. Let Lean simplify the resulting expression\n   d. If necessary, explicitly state that 5 * 5 = 25\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure that the 'square' function is properly recognized and unfolded\n   - Make sure that Lean can perform integer multiplication automatically\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed\n   - Check that no additional assumptions were introduced\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem square_5, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Begin by unfolding the definition of 'square'. The 'square' function is defined as x * x, so we need to rewrite 'square 5' into its expanded form.\n\n2. After expanding the definition, we'll have the goal of proving that 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n3. Lean should be able to recognize that 5 * 5 = 25 automatically, as it's a simple integer multiplication.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most efficient approach would be to use the 'rw' tactic to unfold the definition of 'square', followed by the 'rfl' tactic to prove the equality automatically.\n\nThe 'rw' tactic will rewrite 'square 5' to '5 * 5', and 'rfl' will then prove that 5 * 5 = 25 by reflexivity, as Lean recognizes this equality as true by computation.\n\nThis approach aligns with steps 4a, 4b, and 4d of our proof outline, while potentially skipping 4c as the simplification might not be necessary if 'rfl' can handle it directly.\n",
