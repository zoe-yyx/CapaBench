Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves two types A and B, and two predicates P and Q of type A → B → Prop.\n   - The goal is to prove an implication between two universally quantified statements.\n\n2. Identify the given hypothesis:\n   - We are given: ∀ (a : A) (b : B), P a b → Q a b\n\n3. Identify the goal to prove:\n   - We need to prove: ∀ (a : A) (b : B), ¬ P a b ∨ Q a b\n\n4. Plan the proof strategy:\n   a. Introduce arbitrary variables for A and B:\n      - Let a : A and b : B be arbitrary.\n   \n   b. Use the law of excluded middle:\n      - Either P a b is true or it's false.\n   \n   c. Case analysis:\n      - Case 1: P a b is true\n        * Use the given hypothesis to show Q a b\n        * Conclude ¬ P a b ∨ Q a b by right injection\n      \n      - Case 2: P a b is false\n        * Directly conclude ¬ P a b ∨ Q a b by left injection\n\n5. Utilize Classical logic:\n   - The problem opens with `open Classical`, so we can use classical reasoning techniques.\n\n6. Structure the proof:\n   - Use intros to introduce the hypothesis and arbitrary variables.\n   - Apply classical.byCases for the law of excluded middle.\n   - Use cases for the disjunction in the goal.\n   - Apply the hypothesis where needed.\n   - Use the or.inl and or.inr constructors to build the final disjunction.\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered.\n   - Verify that classical logic is used appropriately.\n   - Check that the final goal matches the theorem statement.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof should begin by introducing the given hypothesis and the arbitrary variables for A and B. We can then use classical reasoning to apply the law of excluded middle on P a b. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis:\n   - Use `intro h` to introduce the given hypothesis (∀ (a : A) (b : B), P a b → Q a b).\n\n2. Introduce arbitrary variables:\n   - Use `intro a b` to introduce arbitrary variables a : A and b : B.\n\n3. Apply the law of excluded middle:\n   - Use `apply Classical.byCases` to consider both cases: P a b is true or P a b is false.\n\n4. For the case where P a b is true:\n   - We can use the hypothesis h to prove Q a b.\n   - Then, we can use `apply Or.inr` to conclude ¬ P a b ∨ Q a b.\n\n5. For the case where P a b is false:\n   - We can directly use `apply Or.inl` to conclude ¬ P a b ∨ Q a b.\n\nThis reasoning covers the main structure of the proof and sets up the case analysis needed to prove the theorem. The acting agent should follow these steps to start building the proof.\n",
