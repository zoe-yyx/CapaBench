    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P ∨ Q is true, then Q ∨ P is true.\n   - This is a logical equivalence, showing that disjunction (OR) is commutative.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - We need to prove an implication: P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P\n   - Use the `intro` tactic to assume the left side of the implication.\n\n3. Case analysis:\n   - Since we have P ∨ Q, we can use case analysis with the `cases` tactic.\n   - This will give us two cases to prove: one where P is true, and one where Q is true.\n\n4. Prove each case:\n   - For the case where P is true:\n     * Use the `right` tactic to prove Q ∨ P by showing P is true.\n   - For the case where Q is true:\n     * Use the `left` tactic to prove Q ∨ P by showing Q is true.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Once both cases are proved, the theorem is complete.\n   - The `cases` tactic should automatically close the proof if both cases are handled correctly.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the symmetry of the OR operation.\n   - It showcases how to handle disjunctions in both the hypothesis and the goal.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the plan's first concrete step. The plan suggests using the `intro` tactic to assume the left side of the implication P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We're dealing with an implication, and the standard approach in Lean 4 is to assume the antecedent (left side) and prove the consequent (right side).\n2. The `intro` tactic is used to introduce a hypothesis, which in this case will be P ∨ Q.\n3. After using `intro`, we'll have a hypothesis of P ∨ Q in our context, and our goal will be to prove Q ∨ P.\n4. This sets us up perfectly for the next step in our plan, which is to perform case analysis on P ∨ Q.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the `intro` tactic to begin the proof. This will create a hypothesis representing P ∨ Q and change the goal to proving Q ∨ P under this assumption.\n",
