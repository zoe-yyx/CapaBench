    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem:\n   - The theorem states: For any propositions P and Q, if P ∨ Q is true, then Q ∨ P is true.\n   - This is a logical equivalence, showing that disjunction (OR) is commutative.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - We need to prove an implication: P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P\n   - Use the `intro` tactic to assume the left side of the implication.\n\n3. Case analysis:\n   - Since we have P ∨ Q, we can use case analysis with the `cases` tactic.\n   - This will give us two cases to prove: one where P is true, and one where Q is true.\n\n4. Prove each case:\n   - For the case where P is true:\n     * Use the `right` tactic to prove Q ∨ P by showing P is true.\n   - For the case where Q is true:\n     * Use the `left` tactic to prove Q ∨ P by showing Q is true.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Once both cases are proved, the theorem is complete.\n   - The `cases` tactic should automatically close the proof if both cases are handled correctly.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof demonstrates the symmetry of the OR operation.\n   - It showcases how to handle disjunctions in both the hypothesis and the goal.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we should proceed with the case analysis as outlined in step 3 of our plan. The `intro h` tactic has successfully introduced the hypothesis `h : P ∨ Q` into our context. Now, we need to use this hypothesis to prove our goal `Q ∨ P`.\n\nThe next logical step is to use the `cases` tactic on our hypothesis `h`. This will split our proof into two cases:\n1. A case where P is true\n2. A case where Q is true\n\nBy doing this, we'll be able to handle each possibility separately and prove that Q ∨ P holds in both scenarios.\n\nAfter applying the `cases` tactic, we'll need to provide proofs for each case, which aligns with step 4 of our plan. The acting agent should be instructed to use the `cases` tactic on `h` for the next operation.\n",
