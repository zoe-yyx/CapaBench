    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for reverseHeight Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that the height of a reversed tree is equal to the height of the original tree.\n   - We need to consider the structure of Tree and the definitions of treeReverse and treeHeight.\n\n2. Proof Structure:\n   - Use structural induction on the Tree type.\n   - Base case: Leaf\n   - Inductive case: Node\n\n3. Base Case (Leaf):\n   - Show that treeHeight (treeReverse leaf) = treeHeight leaf\n\n4. Inductive Case (Node):\n   - Assume the theorem holds for subtrees l and r\n   - Prove for node l v r\n\n5. Key Steps:\n   a. Expand the definition of treeReverse for a node\n   b. Expand the definition of treeHeight for the reversed node\n   c. Use the induction hypotheses for the subtrees\n   d. Apply the myMax_comm theorem to rearrange terms\n   e. Simplify and show equality with the original tree's height\n\n6. Potential Challenges:\n   - Handling the myMax function in the treeHeight definition\n   - Correctly applying the myMax_comm theorem\n\n7. Tactics to Consider:\n   - induction: for structural induction on Tree\n   - simp: to simplify expressions and apply known definitions\n   - rw: to rewrite using myMax_comm and other equalities\n   - cases: to consider different cases of the Tree structure if needed\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the proof follows logically from the given definitions and theorems\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem reverseHeight, we should follow the structural induction approach outlined in the planning strategy. Since we're starting from scratch, we'll begin with setting up the induction on the tree structure.\n\n1. Start with induction on t:\n   This will set up our proof structure, giving us two cases to prove: the base case (leaf) and the inductive case (node).\n\n2. For the base case (leaf):\n   We need to show that treeHeight (treeReverse leaf) = treeHeight leaf. This should be straightforward as both treeReverse and treeHeight have simple definitions for leaf.\n\n3. For the inductive case (node l v r):\n   We'll have induction hypotheses for l and r, stating that the theorem holds for these subtrees. We'll need to use these to prove the case for the entire node.\n\n4. In the node case, we should:\n   a. Expand the definition of treeReverse for the node\n   b. Expand the definition of treeHeight for the reversed node\n   c. Use the induction hypotheses to replace treeHeight (treeReverse l) with treeHeight l and treeHeight (treeReverse r) with treeHeight r\n   d. Apply the myMax_comm theorem to rearrange the terms\n   e. Simplify to show that the result equals treeHeight (node l v r)\n\nThe acting agent should start by applying the induction tactic on t to set up this structure. After that, we can guide through each case step by step.\n",
