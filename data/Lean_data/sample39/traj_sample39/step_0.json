    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We are working with an inductive type `Tree` with two constructors: `leaf` and `node`.\n   - The goal is to prove that a leaf cannot be equal to a node.\n   - The theorem statement suggests that if a leaf were equal to a node, it would imply that 1 = 2 (an obvious contradiction).\n\n2. Approach:\n   - Use proof by contradiction.\n   - Assume that `leaf = node l v r` is true.\n   - Show that this assumption leads to an impossible conclusion (1 = 2).\n\n3. Proof outline:\n   a. Introduce the assumption `leaf = node l v r`.\n   b. Use the fact that constructors of inductive types are injective and disjoint.\n   c. Demonstrate that the assumption violates this principle.\n   d. Conclude that the assumption leads to a contradiction.\n   e. Since the contradiction is represented as 1 = 2, we've proven the theorem.\n\n4. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro (to introduce the hypothesis)\n   - contradiction or absurd (to handle the contradictory assumption)\n   - injection (to work with the equality of inductive type constructors)\n   - rfl (to prove reflexive equality)\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the equality between different constructors of an inductive type.\n   - Clearly showing how the contradiction arises from the assumption.\n\n6. Additional notes:\n   - This proof relies on the fundamental properties of inductive types in Lean.\n   - The specific conclusion \"1 = 2\" is arbitrary; any contradiction would suffice.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the start of the proof, our first step should be to introduce the hypothesis that assumes `leaf = node l v r`. This will set up the contradiction we need to prove.\n\nThe key insight here is that `leaf` and `node` are distinct constructors of the `Tree` inductive type, and they cannot be equal. By assuming they are equal, we're setting up a scenario that will lead to a contradiction.\n\nAfter introducing this hypothesis, we should be able to use Lean's built-in knowledge about inductive types to derive a contradiction. The exact tactic to use might depend on Lean 4's specific capabilities, but we're looking for something that can recognize the impossibility of equating distinct constructors.\n\nOnce we have this contradiction, we should be able to conclude that 1 = 2, fulfilling the theorem's statement.\n\nTherefore, I suggest starting with an `intro` tactic to bring the hypothesis into our context, followed by a tactic that can derive a contradiction from equating distinct constructors.\n",
