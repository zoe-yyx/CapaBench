Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is named 'orIntrol'\n   - It involves two propositions A and B\n   - The goal is to prove: A → A ∨ B\n\n2. Understand the logical operators:\n   - '→' represents implication\n   - '∨' represents logical OR\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis A\n   - Use the left introduction rule for disjunction (∨) to prove A ∨ B\n   - This rule states that if we can prove A, we can conclude A ∨ B\n\n4. Outline the tactics to use:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the hypothesis A\n   - Use 'left' tactic to prove the left side of the disjunction\n   - Use 'exact' or 'assumption' to use the introduced hypothesis A\n\n5. Consider potential challenges:\n   - The proof is straightforward, but ensure correct application of tactics\n   - Pay attention to the order of applying tactics\n\n6. Reflect on the proof's significance:\n   - This theorem demonstrates how to introduce a disjunction from its left component\n   - It's a fundamental building block for more complex logical proofs\n\n7. Prepare for verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Lean 4 without errors\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof for the theorem orIntrol, which states A → A ∨ B, our first step should be to introduce the hypothesis A. This aligns with the planning strategy and follows the standard approach for proving implications in Lean 4.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to prove an implication (A → A ∨ B), so we should start by assuming the left side of the implication (A).\n2. The 'intro' tactic in Lean 4 is used to introduce hypotheses for implications.\n3. After introducing A, we'll have it as a hypothesis in our local context, which we can then use to prove A ∨ B.\n4. Introducing the hypothesis will transform our goal from A → A ∨ B to simply A ∨ B, with A as an available assumption.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in our proof should be to use the 'intro' tactic to introduce the hypothesis A. This will set us up for the subsequent steps of proving the disjunction A ∨ B using the left introduction rule.\n",
