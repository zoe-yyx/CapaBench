    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orIntrol:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is named 'orIntrol'\n   - It involves two propositions A and B\n   - The goal is to prove: A → A ∨ B\n\n2. Understand the logical operators:\n   - '→' represents implication\n   - '∨' represents logical OR\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis A\n   - Use the left introduction rule for disjunction (∨) to prove A ∨ B\n   - This rule states that if we can prove A, we can conclude A ∨ B\n\n4. Outline the tactics to use:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the hypothesis A\n   - Use 'left' tactic to prove the left side of the disjunction\n   - Use 'exact' or 'assumption' to use the introduced hypothesis A\n\n5. Consider potential challenges:\n   - The proof is straightforward, but ensure correct application of tactics\n   - Pay attention to the order of applying tactics\n\n6. Reflect on the proof's significance:\n   - This theorem demonstrates how to introduce a disjunction from its left component\n   - It's a fundamental building block for more complex logical proofs\n\n7. Prepare for verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof is accepted by Lean 4 without errors\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the planning strategy, here's the reasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis 'a : A' using the 'intro' tactic, which aligns with step 3 of our plan.\n\n2. The current goal is to prove 'A ∨ B' given that we have 'a : A' in our context.\n\n3. According to our plan (step 3), we need to use the left introduction rule for disjunction. This corresponds to using the 'left' tactic in Lean 4.\n\n4. After applying 'left', we'll need to prove 'A', which we can do using the hypothesis 'a' that we've already introduced.\n\n5. Therefore, the next logical steps are:\n   a. Apply the 'left' tactic to choose the left side of the disjunction.\n   b. Use the 'exact' tactic with our hypothesis 'a' to complete the proof.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with steps 3 and 4 of our original plan and should lead us to successfully complete the proof of the theorem 'orIntrol'.\n",
