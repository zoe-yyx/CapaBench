    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem logicEx9 involves two types A and B, and two predicates P and Q.\n   - The goal is to prove that if (¬P a b ∨ Q a b) holds for all a and b, then (P a b → Q a b) also holds for all a and b.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin by introducing the hypothesis: assume (∀ (a : A) (b : B), ¬ P a b ∨ Q a b).\n   - Introduce arbitrary a : A and b : B.\n   - Introduce the assumption P a b.\n   - The goal is to prove Q a b.\n\n3. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the universal quantifier from the hypothesis to our arbitrary a and b.\n   - This gives us (¬ P a b ∨ Q a b) for our specific a and b.\n\n4. Case analysis:\n   - Use the disjunction (¬ P a b ∨ Q a b) to split the proof into two cases.\n\n5. Case 1 (¬ P a b):\n   - We have ¬ P a b and P a b, which is a contradiction.\n   - Use this contradiction to prove Q a b (principle of explosion).\n\n6. Case 2 (Q a b):\n   - In this case, we directly have Q a b, which is what we want to prove.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Both cases lead to Q a b, so we have proven the implication P a b → Q a b.\n   - Since a and b were arbitrary, this proves the universal quantification.\n\n8. Verify and clean up:\n   - Ensure all assumptions are discharged.\n   - Check that the proof follows logical steps without gaps.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo complete the proof of theorem logicEx9, we need to apply the hypothesis h and use case analysis. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Remove the incomplete 'have' tactic and its associated block, as it's not necessary for the proof.\n\n2. Apply the hypothesis h to the current a and b:\n   - Use 'have h_case := h a b' to instantiate the universal quantifier in h with our specific a and b.\n   - This gives us ¬P a b ∨ Q a b for the current a and b.\n\n3. Perform case analysis on h_case:\n   - Use 'cases h_case with hnotP hQ' to split into two cases: ¬P a b and Q a b.\n\n4. For the first case (¬P a b):\n   - We have hnotP : ¬P a b and hPab : P a b, which is a contradiction.\n   - Use 'contradiction' to prove this case.\n\n5. For the second case (Q a b):\n   - We directly have hQ : Q a b, which is exactly what we need to prove.\n   - This case is trivially true.\n\n6. Both cases lead to Q a b, so the proof is complete.\n\nBy following these steps, we will prove the theorem without using 'sorry' and provide a rigorous, step-by-step proof that aligns with the original plan.\n",
