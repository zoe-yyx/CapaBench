    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem logicEx9 involves two types A and B, and two predicates P and Q.\n   - The goal is to prove that if (¬P a b ∨ Q a b) holds for all a and b, then (P a b → Q a b) also holds for all a and b.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Begin by introducing the hypothesis: assume (∀ (a : A) (b : B), ¬ P a b ∨ Q a b).\n   - Introduce arbitrary a : A and b : B.\n   - Introduce the assumption P a b.\n   - The goal is to prove Q a b.\n\n3. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the universal quantifier from the hypothesis to our arbitrary a and b.\n   - This gives us (¬ P a b ∨ Q a b) for our specific a and b.\n\n4. Case analysis:\n   - Use the disjunction (¬ P a b ∨ Q a b) to split the proof into two cases.\n\n5. Case 1 (¬ P a b):\n   - We have ¬ P a b and P a b, which is a contradiction.\n   - Use this contradiction to prove Q a b (principle of explosion).\n\n6. Case 2 (Q a b):\n   - In this case, we directly have Q a b, which is what we want to prove.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Both cases lead to Q a b, so we have proven the implication P a b → Q a b.\n   - Since a and b were arbitrary, this proves the universal quantification.\n\n8. Verify and clean up:\n   - Ensure all assumptions are discharged.\n   - Check that the proof follows logical steps without gaps.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to set up the basic structure according to the planning strategy. We need to:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis of the theorem.\n2. Introduce arbitrary elements a and b.\n3. Assume P a b.\n4. Set the goal to prove Q a b.\n\nTo achieve this, we should guide the acting agent to:\n\n1. Use the 'intro' tactic to introduce the hypothesis, which represents the left side of the implication in our theorem.\n2. Use 'intro' again for arbitrary a and b.\n3. Use 'intro' one more time to assume P a b.\n\nAfter these steps, we'll be in a position to start the main body of the proof, where we'll apply the hypothesis and perform case analysis.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on setting up this initial structure, which will provide the foundation for the subsequent logical reasoning.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but the use of 'sorry' and incomplete 'have' tactic are preventing the proof from being completed.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'have' tactic and 'sorry' placeholder, and directly apply the hypothesis h to prove Q a b using case analysis on ¬P a b ∨ Q a b.\n```\n\nThe current approach has set up the proof structure correctly by introducing the necessary hypotheses and assumptions. However, the main proof is not implemented, and the use of 'sorry' is preventing the theorem from being proven rigorously.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should focus on applying the hypothesis h, which states that for all a and b, either ¬P a b or Q a b holds. We already have P a b as an assumption (hPab), so we can use this to eliminate the ¬P a b case and prove Q a b directly.\n\nIn the next steps, the acting agent should:\n\n1. Remove the 'have' tactic and its associated block.\n2. Apply the hypothesis h to the current a and b using 'have h_case := h a b'.\n3. Use 'cases h_case' to split into two cases: ¬P a b and Q a b.\n4. For the ¬P a b case, use 'contradiction' to show it's impossible given hPab.\n5. For the Q a b case, it directly proves our goal.\n\nThis approach will provide a direct and rigorous proof without using 'sorry', aligning with the overall goal of proving the theorem successfully.",
