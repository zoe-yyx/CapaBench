    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem is named 'forallEx2'\n   - It involves three predicates P, Q, and R on a type X\n   - The goal is to prove that if (∀ x : X, P x ∧ Q x → R x) then (∀ x : X, P x → Q x → R x)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis: assume (∀ x : X, P x ∧ Q x → R x)\n   - Set the goal: prove (∀ x : X, P x → Q x → R x)\n\n3. Prove the goal:\n   - Use universal introduction: introduce an arbitrary x : X\n   - Assume P x and Q x\n   - Show that R x follows from these assumptions\n\n4. Use the hypothesis:\n   - Apply the hypothesis to x\n   - Show that P x ∧ Q x holds (which we can do from our assumptions)\n   - Conclude that R x holds\n\n5. Finalize the proof:\n   - Check that all assumptions have been discharged\n   - Ensure the final statement matches the goal theorem\n\n6. Key tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the universal quantifier in the hypothesis\n   - exact: to prove goals that match exactly with available hypotheses\n   - constructor: to prove conjunctions\n\n7. Potential challenges:\n   - Managing the scope of variables and hypotheses\n   - Correctly applying the hypothesis to prove the goal\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to set up the basic structure of the proof. We need to introduce the hypothesis and prepare to prove the goal. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis:\n   We should start by introducing the left-hand side of the implication as a hypothesis. This corresponds to (∀ x : X, P x ∧ Q x → R x).\n\n2. Prepare to prove the right-hand side:\n   We need to set up the structure to prove (∀ x : X, P x → Q x → R x).\n\n3. Use universal introduction:\n   Since our goal starts with a universal quantifier (∀ x : X), we should introduce an arbitrary x of type X.\n\n4. Set up the implication structure:\n   After introducing x, we need to assume P x and Q x separately, and then prove R x.\n\nThese steps will establish the basic structure of our proof, allowing us to then use the hypothesis to complete the proof in subsequent steps.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these initial steps using appropriate Lean 4 tactics, likely including 'intro' for introducing hypotheses and variables, and potentially 'apply' or 'fun' for handling the implications and universal quantifier.\n",
