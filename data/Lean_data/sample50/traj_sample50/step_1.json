Understand the logical structure:\n   - We need to prove an implication (→)\n   - The left side of the implication is a conjunction (∧)\n   - The right side is simply Q\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (P ∧ Q)\n   - Use the 'and' elimination tactic to extract Q from the conjunction\n   - Conclude by showing that Q is true\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - cases: to destruct the conjunction\n   - exact: to finish the proof by showing Q is true\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the conjunction\n   - Properly extract the right-hand side (Q) from the conjunction\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Ensure that the final statement matches the required theorem\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the planning strategy, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis (P ∧ Q) using the 'intro' tactic, which is now represented by 'h' in our local context.\n\n2. The current goal is to prove Q, given that we have h : P ∧ Q in our context.\n\n3. According to our plan, the next step should be to extract Q from the conjunction P ∧ Q.\n\n4. In Lean 4, we can use the 'cases' tactic to destruct a conjunction. This will give us access to both P and Q separately.\n\n5. After using 'cases', we should have Q directly in our context, which can then be used to prove our goal.\n\n6. Once we have Q in our context, we can use the 'exact' tactic to complete the proof.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in our proof should be to use the 'cases' tactic on our hypothesis 'h' to extract Q from the conjunction. This aligns with our original plan and sets us up for the final step of the proof.\n",
