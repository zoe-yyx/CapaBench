Understand the logical structure:\n   - We need to prove an implication (→)\n   - The left side of the implication is a conjunction (∧)\n   - The right side is simply Q\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (P ∧ Q)\n   - Use the 'and' elimination tactic to extract Q from the conjunction\n   - Conclude by showing that Q is true\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - cases: to destruct the conjunction\n   - exact: to finish the proof by showing Q is true\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the conjunction\n   - Properly extract the right-hand side (Q) from the conjunction\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Ensure that the final statement matches the required theorem\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the theorem statement and our plan, we should start by introducing the hypothesis. The theorem is an implication, so we need to assume the left side (P ∧ Q) and prove the right side (Q).\n\nReasoning for the next step:\n1. We should use the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypothesis. This will bring the assumption P ∧ Q into our context.\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we'll need to extract Q from the conjunction P ∧ Q.\n3. The `cases` tactic can be used to destruct the conjunction, giving us access to both P and Q separately.\n4. Once we have Q available, we can use the `exact` tactic to prove our goal, as Q is exactly what we need to show.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start by using the `intro` tactic to bring the hypothesis into the context. This will set up the proof environment for the subsequent steps of deconstructing the conjunction and proving Q.\n",
