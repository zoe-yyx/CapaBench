    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orAndDistrL:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves a bi-implication (↔) between two propositions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff tactic to split the bi-implication into two implications\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Left-to-right direction (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use cases tactic to consider two possibilities:\n     a) Case P is true\n     b) Case Q ∧ R is true\n   - For each case, prove (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left direction (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use cases tactic to consider possible combinations:\n     a) Case P is true in both conjuncts\n     b) Case Q is true in first conjunct, R is true in second conjunct\n     c) Other cases (which should lead to contradiction or imply P)\n   - Prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R) for each valid case\n\n5. Utilize propositional logic tactics:\n   - Use or_inl and or_inr for introducing disjunctions\n   - Use and.left and and.right for eliminating conjunctions\n   - Apply or.elim for case analysis on disjunctions\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure both directions are proven\n   - Use the iff.intro tactic to combine both directions and complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the distributive property of disjunction over conjunction, considering all possible cases and using appropriate Lean 4 tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem orAndDistrL, we should follow the first steps of our strategic plan:\n\n1. Start by using the `iff` tactic to split the bi-implication into two separate implications. This will create two goals, one for each direction of the proof.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction (→), we should introduce the hypothesis P ∨ (Q ∧ R) and then use the `cases` tactic to consider the two possible cases: when P is true, and when Q ∧ R is true.\n\n3. For each case, we'll need to prove (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R), which can be done using `constructor` tactic to split the conjunction, and then using `left` or `right` tactics to prove each disjunction.\n\nThe acting agent should start by applying the `iff` tactic to split the proof into two directions. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof and allow us to tackle each implication separately.\n",
