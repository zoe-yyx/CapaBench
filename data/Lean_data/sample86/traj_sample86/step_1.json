    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orAndDistrL:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves a bi-implication (↔) between two propositions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff tactic to split the bi-implication into two implications\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Left-to-right direction (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use cases tactic to consider two possibilities:\n     a) Case P is true\n     b) Case Q ∧ R is true\n   - For each case, prove (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left direction (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use cases tactic to consider possible combinations:\n     a) Case P is true in both conjuncts\n     b) Case Q is true in first conjunct, R is true in second conjunct\n     c) Other cases (which should lead to contradiction or imply P)\n   - Prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R) for each valid case\n\n5. Utilize propositional logic tactics:\n   - Use or_inl and or_inr for introducing disjunctions\n   - Use and.left and and.right for eliminating conjunctions\n   - Apply or.elim for case analysis on disjunctions\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure both directions are proven\n   - Use the iff.intro tactic to combine both directions and complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the distributive property of disjunction over conjunction, considering all possible cases and using appropriate Lean 4 tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the left-to-right direction (mp case):\n\n1. We have the hypothesis h : P ∨ (Q ∧ R), and we need to prove (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R).\n2. We should use case analysis on the disjunction P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n3. For this, we can use the `cases` tactic on h.\n4. This will give us two cases to prove:\n   a. Case where P is true\n   b. Case where Q ∧ R is true\n5. In each case, we'll need to prove both parts of the conjunction (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ R).\n\nFor the right-to-left direction (mpr case):\n\n1. We have the hypothesis h : (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R), and we need to prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n2. We should first split the conjunction h into its two parts using `cases h with h1 h2`.\n3. Then, we can use case analysis on both h1 and h2.\n4. This will give us four cases to consider:\n   a. P is true in both h1 and h2\n   b. P is true in h1, R is true in h2\n   c. Q is true in h1, P is true in h2\n   d. Q is true in h1, R is true in h2\n5. We'll need to prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R) in each of these cases.\n\nThe acting agent should start with the left-to-right direction, using the `cases` tactic on h in the mp case.\n",
