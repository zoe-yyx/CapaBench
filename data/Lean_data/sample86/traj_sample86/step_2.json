    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orAndDistrL:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves a bi-implication (↔) between two propositions\n   - Left side: P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Right side: (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff tactic to split the bi-implication into two implications\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Left-to-right direction (→):\n   - Assume P ∨ (Q ∧ R)\n   - Use cases tactic to consider two possibilities:\n     a) Case P is true\n     b) Case Q ∧ R is true\n   - For each case, prove (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n\n4. Right-to-left direction (←):\n   - Assume (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)\n   - Use cases tactic to consider possible combinations:\n     a) Case P is true in both conjuncts\n     b) Case Q is true in first conjunct, R is true in second conjunct\n     c) Other cases (which should lead to contradiction or imply P)\n   - Prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R) for each valid case\n\n5. Utilize propositional logic tactics:\n   - Use or_inl and or_inr for introducing disjunctions\n   - Use and.left and and.right for eliminating conjunctions\n   - Apply or.elim for case analysis on disjunctions\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - Ensure both directions are proven\n   - Use the iff.intro tactic to combine both directions and complete the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the distributive property of disjunction over conjunction, considering all possible cases and using appropriate Lean 4 tactics.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the right-to-left direction, we have the hypothesis h : (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R), and we need to prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R). We should consider the possible cases arising from this hypothesis:\n\n1. If P is true in either of the disjunctions, then we can immediately conclude P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n2. If P is false in both disjunctions, then Q must be true in (P ∨ Q) and R must be true in (P ∨ R), which allows us to construct Q ∧ R.\n\nTo implement this reasoning, we should:\n\n1. Use cases tactic on h to split it into its two conjuncts.\n2. For each conjunct, use cases again to consider when P is true or false.\n3. If P is true in either case, we can directly prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n4. If P is false in both cases, we can prove Q ∧ R and then use that to prove P ∨ (Q ∧ R).\n\nThe acting agent should start by using the cases tactic on h to split it into its conjuncts, and then proceed with the case analysis as outlined above.\n",
