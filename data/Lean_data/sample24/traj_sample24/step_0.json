    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving theorem mono_pl:\n\n1. Understand the definitions:\n   - Recall the definition of 'mono' (monotonicity)\n   - Understand 'shift_left1' function\n   - Grasp the meaning of 'preserved_by_shifting_left'\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the goal: preserved_by_shifting_left mono\n   - Unfold the definition of preserved_by_shifting_left\n\n3. Main proof steps:\n   a. Introduce arbitrary function f and assumption that f is monotonic\n   b. Show that shift_left1 f is also monotonic:\n      - Take arbitrary integers n and m with n ≤ m\n      - Prove: shift_left1 f n ≤ shift_left1 f m\n   c. Use the definition of shift_left1:\n      - Rewrite goal as: f (n + 1) ≤ f (m + 1)\n   d. Apply monotonicity of f:\n      - Show that (n + 1) ≤ (m + 1)\n      - Use the assumption n ≤ m and properties of addition\n\n4. Conclude the proof:\n   - Summarize that shift_left1 f is monotonic when f is monotonic\n   - This proves that mono is preserved by shifting left\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro, intros for introducing variables and hypotheses\n   - unfold for expanding definitions\n   - apply for using the monotonicity of f\n   - linarith for handling integer inequalities\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Properly handling the shift in the function argument\n   - Ensuring all necessary hypotheses are used correctly\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem mono_pl, breaking down the proof into manageable steps and highlighting key concepts and tactics to use.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem mono_pl, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Unfold the definition of preserved_by_shifting_left and mono. This will give us a clear view of what we need to prove.\n\n2. Introduce the necessary variables and hypotheses:\n   - Introduce an arbitrary function f\n   - Introduce the hypothesis that f is monotonic\n   - Introduce arbitrary integers n and m\n   - Introduce the hypothesis that n ≤ m\n\n3. Set up the goal we need to prove: shift_left1 f n ≤ shift_left1 f m\n\n4. Unfold the definition of shift_left1 in the goal. This will transform our goal into:\n   f (n + 1) ≤ f (m + 1)\n\n5. To prove this, we can use the monotonicity of f. We know f is monotonic, so if we can show that (n + 1) ≤ (m + 1), we can apply the monotonicity property to conclude f (n + 1) ≤ f (m + 1).\n\n6. The inequality (n + 1) ≤ (m + 1) follows directly from n ≤ m, which we have as a hypothesis.\n\n7. Apply the monotonicity of f to complete the proof.\n\nFor the acting agent, the first step should be to unfold the definitions and introduce the necessary variables and hypotheses. This will set up the proof structure and allow us to work with the concrete elements we need to prove the theorem.\n",
