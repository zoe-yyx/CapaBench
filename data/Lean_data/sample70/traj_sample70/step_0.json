Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is a bi-implication (↔) between two universal quantifiers.\n   - The hypothesis is a universal quantifier containing a bi-implication.\n\n2. Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the intro tactic to introduce the hypothesis.\n   - Apply the iff.intro tactic to split the conclusion into two implications.\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (→):\n   - Introduce the assumption for the left-hand side of the main bi-implication.\n   - Use the intro tactic to handle the universal quantifier on the right-hand side.\n   - Apply the hypothesis to convert from P to Q.\n   - Use the assumption from step 3a to complete this direction.\n\n4. Prove the backward direction (←):\n   - Introduce the assumption for the right-hand side of the main bi-implication.\n   - Use the intro tactic to handle the universal quantifier on the left-hand side.\n   - Apply the hypothesis to convert from Q to P.\n   - Use the assumption from step 4a to complete this direction.\n\n5. Close the proof:\n   - The iff.intro tactic from step 2 should automatically close the proof once both directions are proved.\n\nNote: This plan takes advantage of the symmetry in the theorem structure, applying similar steps for both directions of the bi-implication.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by following the first two steps of our plan:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis using the `intro` tactic. This will bring the universal quantifier and the bi-implication from the hypothesis into our local context.\n\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we should split the main goal (which is a bi-implication) into two separate implications using the `apply iff.intro` tactic. This will create two subgoals, one for each direction of the bi-implication.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should start with these two steps:\n\n1. Use the `intro` tactic to introduce the hypothesis.\n2. Apply the `iff.intro` tactic to split the goal into two implications.\n\nThese actions will set up the structure for the rest of the proof, allowing us to tackle each direction of the bi-implication separately.\n",
