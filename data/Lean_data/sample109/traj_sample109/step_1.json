    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem mul_one_left:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplying 1 (represented as succ zero) by any natural number n results in n itself.\n   - We need to show: mul (succ zero) n = n for any n : Nat\n\n2. Analyze available definitions and theorems:\n   - We have definitions for add and mul functions.\n   - We have two proven theorems: add_zero_right and mul_zero_left (although their proofs are skipped with sorry).\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side: mul (succ zero) n\n   b. Expand the definition of mul for the case of succ n'\n   c. Simplify the resulting expression\n   d. Show that the simplified expression equals n\n\n4. Detailed steps:\n   a. Apply the definition of mul with (succ zero) as the first argument\n   b. This will result in: add n (mul zero n)\n   c. Use the mul_zero_left theorem to simplify mul zero n to zero\n   d. Now we have: add n zero\n   e. Apply the add_zero_right theorem to simplify add n zero to n\n   f. Conclude that mul (succ zero) n = n\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct application of the mul and add definitions\n   - Properly utilize the add_zero_right and mul_zero_left theorems\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Ensure that the final result matches the theorem statement\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the mul_one_left theorem using the available definitions and theorems in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current observation and our planning strategy, we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. We have successfully unfolded the definition of mul, which has given us the goal: add n (mul 0 n) = n\n\n2. Our next step should focus on simplifying the expression mul 0 n. We can use the mul_zero_left theorem for this purpose.\n\n3. After applying mul_zero_left, we will have: add n zero = n\n\n4. This new goal can be directly solved using the add_zero_right theorem.\n\n5. These steps align with our original plan and should lead us to the final proof of mul_one_left.\n\nTherefore, I suggest guiding the acting agent to:\n1. Apply the mul_zero_left theorem to simplify mul 0 n to zero.\n2. Then, use the add_zero_right theorem to complete the proof.\n\nThis reasoning should provide a clear path for the acting agent to proceed with the proof.\n",
