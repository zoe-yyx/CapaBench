Understand the problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplying 1 (represented as succ zero) by any natural number n results in n itself.\n   - We need to show: mul (succ zero) n = n for any n : Nat\n\n2. Analyze available definitions and theorems:\n   - We have definitions for add and mul functions.\n   - We have two proven theorems: add_zero_right and mul_zero_left (although their proofs are skipped with sorry).\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side: mul (succ zero) n\n   b. Expand the definition of mul for the case of succ n'\n   c. Simplify the resulting expression\n   d. Show that the simplified expression equals n\n\n4. Detailed steps:\n   a. Apply the definition of mul with (succ zero) as the first argument\n   b. This will result in: add n (mul zero n)\n   c. Use the mul_zero_left theorem to simplify mul zero n to zero\n   d. Now we have: add n zero\n   e. Apply the add_zero_right theorem to simplify add n zero to n\n   f. Conclude that mul (succ zero) n = n\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct application of the mul and add definitions\n   - Properly utilize the add_zero_right and mul_zero_left theorems\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Ensure that the final result matches the theorem statement\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the mul_one_left theorem using the available definitions and theorems in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mul_one_left (n : Nat) : mul (succ zero) n = n, we should follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. Start by expanding the definition of mul with (succ zero) as the first argument. This will give us the first step in our proof.\n\n2. After expanding the definition, we'll need to work with the expression add n (mul zero n). This is where we can apply the mul_zero_left theorem to simplify the inner part.\n\n3. Once we've simplified mul zero n to zero, we'll have the expression add n zero. At this point, we can apply the add_zero_right theorem.\n\n4. After applying add_zero_right, we should arrive at our goal of showing that the expression equals n.\n\nGiven that we're starting from scratch, the first step should be to expand the definition of mul. The acting agent should use a tactic that allows us to unfold or expand the definition of mul for the case where the first argument is (succ zero).\n\nThis initial step will set up the proof structure and allow us to proceed with the subsequent simplifications and theorem applications as outlined in the plan.\n",
