    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves logical equivalence (↔) and disjunction (∨)\n   - We need to prove that (P1 ∨ Q1) is equivalent to (P2 ∨ Q2) given two premises\n\n2. Break down the equivalence:\n   - To prove (A ↔ B), we need to show both (A → B) and (B → A)\n   - In this case, we need to prove:\n     a. (P1 ∨ Q1 → P2 ∨ Q2)\n     b. (P2 ∨ Q2 → P1 ∨ Q1)\n\n3. Utilize the given premises:\n   - We have (P1 ↔ P2) and (Q1 ↔ Q2)\n   - These can be used to transform P1 to P2 and Q1 to Q2 (and vice versa)\n\n4. Proof strategy:\n   a. For (P1 ∨ Q1 → P2 ∨ Q2):\n      - Assume P1 ∨ Q1\n      - Use case analysis (or elimination) on this assumption\n      - For each case, use the corresponding premise to transform to P2 or Q2\n      - Conclude P2 ∨ Q2\n   \n   b. For (P2 ∨ Q2 → P1 ∨ Q1):\n      - Follow a similar strategy as above, but in the reverse direction\n\n5. Combine the proofs:\n   - Use the biconditional introduction rule to combine both directions of the proof\n\n6. Consider using Lean 4 tactics:\n   - intro for introducing hypotheses\n   - cases for case analysis on disjunctions\n   - left and right for introducing disjunctions\n   - rw for rewriting using equivalences\n   - exact for concluding with a matching goal\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem orCongr, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduce the hypotheses:\n   We have four propositions (P1, Q1, P2, Q2) and two premises ((P1 ↔ P2) and (Q1 ↔ Q2)). We should introduce these into our context.\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   To prove (P1 ∨ Q1 ↔ P2 ∨ Q2), we need to show both directions of the implication. We should start by proving (P1 ∨ Q1 → P2 ∨ Q2).\n\n3. Begin with the first direction:\n   a. Assume (P1 ∨ Q1)\n   b. Use case analysis on this assumption\n   c. For the P1 case:\n      - Use the premise (P1 ↔ P2) to transform P1 into P2\n      - Introduce P2 ∨ Q2 by using the 'left' tactic\n   d. For the Q1 case:\n      - Use the premise (Q1 ↔ Q2) to transform Q1 into Q2\n      - Introduce P2 ∨ Q2 by using the 'right' tactic\n\n4. After completing the first direction, we should prove the reverse direction (P2 ∨ Q2 → P1 ∨ Q1) using a similar approach.\n\n5. Finally, we can combine both directions to conclude the proof.\n\nGiven that we're starting from scratch, the acting agent should begin by introducing the hypotheses and setting up the structure for the first direction of the proof.\n",
