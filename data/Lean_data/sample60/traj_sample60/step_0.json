Analyze the problem structure:\n   - The theorem involves three predicates P, Q, and R over a type X.\n   - We need to prove an implication between two universally quantified statements.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis (∀ x : X, P x → Q x → R x) into the context.\n   - Introduce a universal quantifier for x : X.\n   - Introduce the hypothesis (P x ∧ Q x).\n\n3. Break down the conjunction:\n   - Split the hypothesis (P x ∧ Q x) into two separate hypotheses: P x and Q x.\n\n4. Apply the universal quantifier:\n   - Instantiate the first hypothesis (∀ x : X, P x → Q x → R x) with the specific x we introduced.\n\n5. Use implication elimination:\n   - Apply the instantiated hypothesis to P x and Q x to derive R x.\n\n6. Conclude the proof:\n   - We have derived R x, which is exactly what we needed to prove.\n   - This completes the proof of the implication and the universal quantifier.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Ensure all hypotheses are used and the goal is met.\n   - Check that no unnecessary steps were introduced.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin the proof of the theorem forallEx1, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduce the given hypothesis:\n   We need to introduce the left-hand side of the implication as a hypothesis. This can be done using the `intro` tactic.\n\n2. Introduce the universal quantifier:\n   We need to consider an arbitrary x of type X. This can also be done with the `intro` tactic.\n\n3. Introduce the conjunction hypothesis:\n   We need to introduce the hypothesis (P x ∧ Q x) into our context. Again, the `intro` tactic can be used for this.\n\n4. Break down the conjunction:\n   We should split the conjunction (P x ∧ Q x) into two separate hypotheses. The `cases` tactic is suitable for this operation.\n\n5. Apply the universal quantifier:\n   We need to instantiate our first hypothesis with the specific x we introduced. This can be done using the `have` tactic to create a new hypothesis that applies the universal quantifier to our specific x.\n\n6. Use implication elimination:\n   We should apply the instantiated hypothesis to our P x and Q x hypotheses to derive R x. This can be accomplished using function application or the `apply` tactic.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   At this point, we should have derived R x, which is our goal. The proof should be complete.\n\nGiven that we're starting from scratch, the acting agent should begin with the first step: introducing the given hypothesis. The `intro` tactic is the most appropriate tool for this initial step.\n",
