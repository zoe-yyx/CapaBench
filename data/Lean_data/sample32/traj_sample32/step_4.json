    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for treeExample3bSize theorem:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of treeExample3b is 5.\n   - The treeSize function is defined recursively for the Tree data type.\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample2b (which is part of treeExample3b).\n\n3. Apply treeSize function:\n   - Apply the treeSize function to the expanded structure of treeExample3b.\n\n4. Simplify calculations:\n   - Simplify the nested treeSize calculations.\n   - Add up the individual node counts.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Confirm that the final calculation equals 5.\n\n6. Optional: Visualization\n   - Consider drawing or visualizing the tree structure to aid in understanding and counting nodes.\n\n7. Proof structure:\n   - Use rewrite tactics to expand definitions.\n   - Use simp to simplify calculations.\n   - Use rfl for reflexivity at the end to prove equality.\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, applying the treeSize function, and simplifying the calculations to show that treeSize treeExample3b indeed equals 5.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is on the right track, but we need to adjust our approach for handling the treeExample2b definition. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've correctly expanded treeExample3b and applied treeSize initially.\n2. Now, we need to expand treeExample2b, but we should use 'unfold' instead of 'rw' since it's a definition, not an equation.\n3. After unfolding treeExample2b, we should apply simp with treeSize again to simplify the expanded structure.\n4. This process should reduce the expression to a simple arithmetic calculation.\n5. Finally, we can use reflexivity (rfl) to complete the proof.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on:\n- Using 'unfold treeExample2b' to expand its definition.\n- Applying 'simp [treeSize]' after unfolding to simplify the structure.\n- Using 'rfl' at the end to prove the final equality.\n\nThis approach should systematically break down the tree structure, apply the treeSize function correctly, and lead to the desired result of 5.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof steps are correct, but the theorem was already proven in the previous steps, resulting in \"no goals to be solved\" error.\nImprovement: Remove the unnecessary steps after 'simp [treeSize]' and end the proof with 'rfl' to complete it efficiently.\n```\n\nThe current approach was actually on the right track, but it went further than necessary. The proof was completed earlier than expected, which is a positive outcome. Here's a breakdown of what happened:\n\n1. The 'rw [treeExample3b]' step correctly expanded the definition of treeExample3b.\n2. The subsequent 'simp [treeSize]' step was powerful enough to simplify the entire expression down to the final result.\n3. After these two steps, the goal was already solved, which is why we encountered the \"no goals to be solved\" error when trying to proceed further.\n\nFor future proofs, we should:\n1. Apply transformations step-by-step, checking the state of the proof after each significant operation.\n2. Be prepared for simplification steps (like simp) to potentially solve more of the problem than initially expected.\n3. Use 'rfl' immediately after a simplification step if the goal appears to be solved.\n\nIn this case, the proof can be completed more concisely with just:\n\n```lean\ntheorem treeExample3bSize : treeSize treeExample3b = 5 := by\n  rw [treeExample3b]\n  simp [treeSize]\n  rfl\n```\n\nThis approach will efficiently prove the theorem without unnecessary steps, aligning perfectly with the goal of proving the problem successfully.",
