Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of treeExample3b is 5.\n   - The treeSize function is defined recursively for the Tree data type.\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample2b (which is part of treeExample3b).\n\n3. Apply treeSize function:\n   - Apply the treeSize function to the expanded structure of treeExample3b.\n\n4. Simplify calculations:\n   - Simplify the nested treeSize calculations.\n   - Add up the individual node counts.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Confirm that the final calculation equals 5.\n\n6. Optional: Visualization\n   - Consider drawing or visualizing the tree structure to aid in understanding and counting nodes.\n\n7. Proof structure:\n   - Use rewrite tactics to expand definitions.\n   - Use simp to simplify calculations.\n   - Use rfl for reflexivity at the end to prove equality.\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, applying the treeSize function, and simplifying the calculations to show that treeSize treeExample3b indeed equals 5.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof has actually been completed successfully with the first two steps. The 'rw [treeExample3b]' expanded the definition of treeExample3b, and then 'simp [treeSize]' was powerful enough to simplify the entire expression to the desired result. At this point, the goal is already solved, and we just need to confirm this with a reflexivity check.\n\nTherefore, the next and final step should be to apply the reflexivity tactic 'rfl'. This will complete the proof by showing that the left-hand side is indeed equal to the right-hand side after the simplification.\n\nWe don't need to unfold treeExample2b or perform any further simplifications, as the theorem has already been proven by the previous steps. The 'rfl' tactic will serve as the final confirmation of the equality.\n",
