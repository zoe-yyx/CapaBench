Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of treeExample3b is 5.\n   - The treeSize function is defined recursively for the Tree data type.\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample2b (which is part of treeExample3b).\n\n3. Apply treeSize function:\n   - Apply the treeSize function to the expanded structure of treeExample3b.\n\n4. Simplify calculations:\n   - Simplify the nested treeSize calculations.\n   - Add up the individual node counts.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Confirm that the final calculation equals 5.\n\n6. Optional: Visualization\n   - Consider drawing or visualizing the tree structure to aid in understanding and counting nodes.\n\n7. Proof structure:\n   - Use rewrite tactics to expand definitions.\n   - Use simp to simplify calculations.\n   - Use rfl for reflexivity at the end to prove equality.\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, applying the treeSize function, and simplifying the calculations to show that treeSize treeExample3b indeed equals 5.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof strategy needs to be adjusted to break down the treeSize calculation into smaller, more manageable steps. We should:\n\n1. Start by calculating the size of the innermost subtrees and work our way outward.\n2. Use 'have' statements to clearly show each step of the calculation.\n3. Apply the treeSize function definition explicitly at each step.\n4. Use 'simp' and 'norm_num' tactitanianwatchcs to simplify arithmetic expressions.\n\nLet's begin with the leftmost leaf node and gradually build up to the entire tree:\n\n1. Calculate the size of Tree.leaf.node 9 Tree.leaf\n2. Calculate the size of Tree.leaf.node 8 Tree.leaf\n3. Use these to calculate the size of treeExample2b\n4. Calculate the size of Tree.leaf.node 3 Tree.leaf\n5. Finally, combine all these to calculate the size of treeExample3b\n\nThis step-by-step approach will make the proof more transparent and easier to verify, while also demonstrating how the final result of 5 is obtained.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof strategy is correct, but the final step fails to fully simplify the expression and complete the proof.\n\nImprovement: Add an explicit calculation step after the final simp tactic to show that 3 + 1 + 1 = 5, using norm_num or a manual arithmetic step.\n```\n\nThe current proof strategy is well-structured and breaks down the problem into manageable steps. However, the final simplification step doesn't completely resolve the goal. Here's a detailed reflection:\n\n1. The proof correctly calculates the sizes of subtrees and uses them to build up to the final result.\n2. The use of 'have' statements for intermediate results is effective and clear.\n3. The simp tactic is used appropriately to simplify expressions at each step.\n\nTo improve the proof and complete it successfully:\n\n1. After the final simp [treeSize, h3, h4] step, the goal likely reduces to something like 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n2. We need an additional step to perform this final arithmetic calculation.\n3. We can use the norm_num tactic to automatically solve simple arithmetic goals.\n4. Alternatively, we could use rfl or a manual calculation step to show that 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nFor the next attempt, we should add one more step after the final simp tactic:\n\n```lean\nsimp [treeSize, h3, h4]\nnorm_num  -- or 'rfl' if the goal is already simplified to 5 = 5\n```\n\nThis additional step should complete the proof by resolving the final arithmetic calculation and proving the theorem.",
