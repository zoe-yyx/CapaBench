    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem treeExample3bSize, we should follow the strategic plan laid out. Our first step should be to expand the definitions of treeExample3b and treeExample2b. This will give us a clear view of the tree structure we're working with.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We need to unfold the definition of treeExample3b first. This will reveal its structure, including the embedded treeExample2b.\n\n2. After unfolding treeExample3b, we should then unfold treeExample2b to fully expose the entire tree structure.\n\n3. Once the tree structure is fully expanded, we can apply the treeSize function to this structure.\n\n4. The treeSize function will recursively calculate the size of each subtree and add them together.\n\n5. As we calculate, we'll be adding 1 for each node encountered (as per the treeSize definition for nodes).\n\n6. After expansion and application of treeSize, we should be able to see a series of additions that we can simplify.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by using tactics to unfold the definitions of treeExample3b and treeExample2b. This will set the stage for applying the treeSize function and performing the necessary calculations.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, I can provide the following reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof strategy was correct, but the `simp` tactic failed to fully simplify the expression.\nImprovement: We should use a combination of `simp` and manual calculation steps to break down the treeSize function application.\n```\n\nThe planning and initial steps were correct, as we successfully unfolded the definitions of `treeExample3b` and `treeExample2b`. However, the `simp [treeSize]` step did not fully simplify the expression as expected.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. After unfolding the definitions, apply the `treeSize` function step by step, starting from the innermost nodes.\n2. Use `simp` in combination with explicit calculations. For example, we could use `simp [treeSize]` after each step to simplify intermediate results.\n3. Break down the calculation into smaller steps, possibly using `have` statements to show intermediate results.\n4. Use the `norm_num` tactic to perform arithmetic calculations when needed.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to gradually reduce the complex tree structure to the final result of 5, making the proof more transparent and easier to verify. This approach will also help identify any potential issues in the calculation process more easily.",
