Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of treeExample3b is 5.\n   - The treeSize function is defined recursively for the Tree data type.\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample2b (which is part of treeExample3b).\n\n3. Apply treeSize function:\n   - Apply the treeSize function to the expanded structure of treeExample3b.\n\n4.

Optional: Visualization\n   - Consider drawing or visualizing the tree structure to aid in understanding and counting nodes.\n\n7. Proof structure:\n   - Use rewrite tactics to expand definitions.\n   - Use simp to simplify calculations.\n   - Use rfl for reflexivity at the end to prove equality.\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, applying the treeSize function, and simplifying the calculations to show that treeSize treeExample3b indeed equals 5.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof strategy has been effective in breaking down the problem and calculating the sizes of subtrees. We've successfully expanded the definitions, applied the treeSize function to various parts of the tree, and simplified the calculations using simp tactics and intermediate results (h1, h2, h3, and h4).\n\nHowever, the final step didn't completely resolve the goal. After the last simp [treeSize, h3, h4] tactic, we likely have a goal that looks like:\n\n⊢ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nTo complete the proof, we need to perform this final arithmetic calculation. We can do this by adding one more tactic after the final simp. The norm_num tactic is ideal for solving simple arithmetic goals like this.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to apply the norm_num tactic. This will perform the final calculation and should complete the proof.\n\nIf norm_num doesn't resolve the goal for any reason, we can fall back to using rfl, which should work if the expression is already simplified to 5 = 5.\n\nSo, the next step in the proof should be:\n\nnorm_num\n\nThis should finalize the proof by resolving the remaining arithmetic calculation and proving the theorem treeExample3bSize.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed due to an unexpected identifier at the beginning of the file, indicating a syntax error or misplaced code.\n\nImprovement: Review and correct the file structure, ensuring that all definitions and theorems are properly placed and that the proof script starts with the correct theorem statement followed by `: by`.\n```\n\nThe current error suggests that there's an issue with the structure of the Lean file or the placement of the proof script. Here are some specific points to consider for improvement:\n\n1. File Structure: Ensure that all necessary definitions (Tree, treeExample2b, treeExample3b, treeSize) are present and correctly placed in the file before the theorem statement.\n\n2. Theorem Statement: Verify that the theorem statement for treeExample3bSize is correctly written and placed in the file.\n\n3. Proof Script: Make sure the proof script starts immediately after the theorem statement with `: by` and that all tactics are properly indented.\n\n4. Syntax Check: Review the entire file for any syntax errors, misplaced characters, or incorrect indentation that could cause the \"unexpected identifier\" error.\n\n5. Isolation: If possible, try to isolate the theorem and its proof in a separate file to rule out interference from other parts of the code.\n\n6. Step-by-Step Approach: Consider building the proof incrementally, starting with the theorem statement and adding tactics one by one, to pinpoint where the error occurs.\n\nBy addressing these points, we should be able to correct the structural issues in the file and proceed with the actual proof logic. Once the file structure is corrected, we can focus on completing the arithmetic calculations to finalize the proof.",
