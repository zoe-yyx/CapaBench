Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of treeExample3b is 5.\n   - The treeSize function is defined recursively for the Tree data type.\n\n2. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample3b.\n   - Expand the definition of treeExample2b (which is part of treeExample3b).\n\n3. Apply treeSize function:\n   - Apply the treeSize function to the expanded structure of treeExample3b.\n\n4. Simplify calculations:\n   - Simplify the nested treeSize calculations.\n   - Add up the individual node counts.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Confirm that the final calculation equals 5.\n\n6. Optional: Visualization\n   - Consider drawing or visualizing the tree structure to aid in understanding and counting nodes.\n\n7. Proof structure:\n   - Use rewrite tactics to expand definitions.\n   - Use simp to simplify calculations.\n   - Use rfl for reflexivity at the end to prove equality.\n\nThis plan provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem, focusing on expanding definitions, applying the treeSize function, and simplifying the calculations to show that treeSize treeExample3b indeed equals 5.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. File Structure Correction:\n   Ensure that the file starts with the necessary imports and definitions. The error suggests there might be some misplaced code at the beginning of the file.\n\n2. Theorem Statement:\n   Verify that the theorem statement is correctly placed and formatted:\n   theorem treeExample3bSize : treeSize treeExample3b = 5 := by\n\n3. Proof Strategy:\n   Once the file structure is corrected, we can proceed with the proof. Given the current goal and hypotheses, we should:\n   a) Expand the definition of treeExample3b\n   b) Apply the treeSize function to the expanded structure\n   c) Use the hypotheses (h1 to h4) to simplify the calculation\n\n4. Suggested Tactics:\n   - Use 'rw [treeExample3b]' to expand the definition of treeExample3b\n   - Use 'simp [treeSize]' to apply the treeSize function and simplify\n   - Use 'rw [h3, h4]' to replace known values\n   - Finally, use arithmetic simplification and 'rfl' to complete the proof\n\n5. Step-by-Step Guidance:\n   After correcting the file structure, start the proof with:\n   rw [treeExample3b]\n   simp [treeSize]\n   rw [h3, h4]\n   simp\n   rfl\n\nThis approach should systematically break down the problem, use the given hypotheses, and lead to the desired conclusion that treeSize treeExample3b = 5.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt fails because it's trying to rewrite treeExample2b, which is not an equation but a definition.\n\nImprovement: Instead of using 'rw' for treeExample2b, we should use 'unfold' to expand its definition, then continue with simplification using 'simp'.\n```\n\nThe current approach was on the right track by first expanding treeExample3b and simplifying with treeSize. However, it encountered an error when trying to rewrite treeExample2b. This is because treeExample2b is a definition, not an equation that can be used for rewriting.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we should:\n\n1. Continue using 'rw' for treeExample3b as it correctly expands the definition.\n2. Use 'simp [treeSize]' to apply the treeSize function.\n3. Instead of 'rw [treeExample2b]', use 'unfold treeExample2b' to expand its definition.\n4. Apply 'simp [treeSize]' again to simplify the expanded tree structure.\n5. Finally, use 'rfl' to complete the proof by reflexivity.\n\nThis adjusted approach should allow us to systematically break down the tree structure and calculate its size correctly, leading to the desired conclusion that treeSize treeExample3b = 5.\n\nFor future proofs involving complex data structures or definitions, remember to distinguish between equations (which can be used with 'rw') and definitions (which should be expanded with 'unfold'). This distinction is crucial for correct application of Lean tactics.",
