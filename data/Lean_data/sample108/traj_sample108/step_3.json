Understand the Problem:\n   - The goal is to prove that multiplication is associative for natural numbers.\n   - We need to show: mul n (mul m p) = mul (mul n m) p for any n, m, and p.\n\n2. Choose Proof Technique:\n   - Use induction on 'n' as multiplication is defined recursively on the first argument.\n\n3. Set Up Induction:\n   - Base case: n = 0\n   - Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for n', prove for (succ n')\n\n4. Prove Base Case:\n   - Simplify mul 0 (mul m p) using the definition of mul\n   - Simplify mul (mul 0 m) p using the definition of mul\n   - Show that both sides equal 0\n\n5. Prove Inductive Step:\n   - Start with mul (succ n') (mul m p)\n   - Use the definition of mul to expand this\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis\n   - Use the mul_add_distr_r theorem (which is given as sorry)\n   - Manipulate the expressions to show equality\n\n6. Use Auxiliary Lemmas:\n   - Utilize the mul_add_distr_r theorem when needed\n\n7. Apply Simplification:\n   - Use the definitions of add and mul to simplify expressions where possible\n\n8. Conclude the Proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Verify that the final expression matches the right-hand side of the theorem\n\n9. Review and Refine:\n   - Check each step for logical consistency\n   - Ensure all uses of definitions and theorems are correct\n",

Proved the base case (n = 0) using simp [mul]\n3. For the inductive step (n = succ n'):\n   - Applied the definition of mul\n   - Used the inductive hypothesis\n   - Applied the distributive property of multiplication over addition\n\nThe final step needs a slight modification. Instead of using 'rw [mul]', which didn't fully resolve the goal, we should use 'rfl' to prove that the remaining equation is true by reflexivity.\n\nThe current goal is:\n⊢ mul (add m (mul n' m)) p = mul (mul (n' + 1) m) p\n\nThis equation is true by the definition of mul for succ n', which states:\nmul (succ n') m = add m (mul n' m)\n\nTherefore, both sides of the equation are already equal, and we can prove this using reflexivity.\n\nThe acting agent should replace the last line 'rw [mul]' with 'rfl' to complete the proof.\n",
