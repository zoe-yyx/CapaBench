By following these steps, the player should be able to construct a clear and concise proof in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem shift_up1_shift_left1_comm, we should follow the plan step by step. Since we're at the beginning of the proof, we should start with setting up the proof structure and using function extensionality.\n\n1. Begin by using the 'funext' tactic to apply function extensionality. This will allow us to prove the equality of the functions by showing they produce the same output for an arbitrary input.\n\n2. After applying 'funext', we should introduce an arbitrary integer x, which will be our point of comparison for the two sides of the equality.\n\n3. Next, we should focus on expanding the definitions of shift_up1 and shift_left1 on both sides of the equality. This will involve unfolding the definitions and simplifying the expressions.\n\n4. Once the definitions are expanded, we can use the 'simp' tactic to simplify the expressions on both sides. This should help in revealing that the two sides are indeed equal.\n\n5. If the simplification doesn't immediately show the equality, we may need to perform some algebraic manipulations to demonstrate that the expressions are equivalent.\n\n6. Finally, if the expressions are visibly identical after simplification, we can use the 'rfl' tactic to complete the proof by reflexivity.\n\nThe acting agent should start by applying the 'funext' tactic and then proceed with expanding definitions and simplifying expressions.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof was close to completion, but the final 'rfl' tactic was unnecessary and caused an error as there were no more goals to be solved.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'rfl' tactic at the end of the proof, as the 'simp' tactic has already simplified the expressions to show their equality.\n```\n\nThe proof process was largely correct and effective. The 'funext' tactic was correctly applied to introduce an arbitrary integer x. The definitions were then unfolded using 'unfold shift_up1 shift_left1', which was the right approach. The 'simp' tactic was then used to simplify the expressions.\n\nThe key insight here is that after the 'simp' tactic, the proof was actually complete. The simplified expressions 'f (x + 1) + 1 = (fun x => f x + 1) (x + 1)' are indeed equal, and Lean recognizes this equality without needing an additional 'rfl' tactic.\n\nFor future proofs, it's important to pay attention to the state of the proof after each tactic application. If there are no more goals to be solved, it means the proof is complete, and no further tactics are needed.\n\nIn the next iteration, the acting agent should remove the 'rfl' tactic and the proof should be complete. This will result in a successful proof of the theorem shift_up1_shift_left1_comm.",
