Understand the definitions:\n   - Review the definitions of shift_left1 and shift_up1\n   - Identify how these functions transform the input function f\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with the goal of proving equality between shift_up1 (shift_left1 f) and shift_left1 (shift_up1 f)\n   - Use function extensionality to show that these functions are equal for all inputs\n\n3. Choose an arbitrary input:\n   - Introduce an arbitrary integer x\n\n4. Expand definitions:\n   - Expand the left-hand side: shift_up1 (shift_left1 f)\n   - Expand the right-hand side: shift_left1 (shift_up1 f)\n\n5. Simplify expressions:\n   - Simplify both sides using the definitions of shift_left1 and shift_up1\n\n6. Show equality:\n   - Demonstrate that the simplified expressions on both sides are identical\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - Use the fact that the expressions are equal for an arbitrary x to conclude that the functions are equal\n\n8. Consider using tactics:\n   - Utilize Lean 4 tactics like 'funext', 'simp', and 'rfl' to streamline the proof\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the commutativity of shift_up1 and shift_left1 operations on a function f. By following these steps, the player should be able to construct a clear and concise proof in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete and has followed the correct steps. Let's analyze the current state:\n\n1. We've used 'funext x' to introduce an arbitrary integer x, which aligns with our plan to prove equality for all inputs.\n\n2. We've unfolded the definitions of shift_up1 and shift_left1 using the 'unfold' tactic, which exposes the internal structure of these functions.\n\n3. The 'simp' tactic has simplified the expressions on both sides of the equality, resulting in:\n   ⊢ f (x + 1) + 1 = (fun x => f x + 1) (x + 1)\n\nAt this point, the proof is actually complete. The expressions on both sides are identical:\n- The left side directly applies f to (x + 1) and then adds 1.\n- The right side defines a function that adds 1 to f x, and then applies this function to (x + 1).\n\nThese operations are equivalent, and Lean recognizes this without needing further proof.\n\nThe error message \"no goals to be solved\" after the 'simp' tactic indicates that Lean considers the proof finished.\n\nNext step:\nRemove the 'rfl' tactic as it's unnecessary and causing an error. The proof is complete after the 'simp' tactic.\n\nThis approach demonstrates the commutativity of shift_up1 and shift_left1 operations on the function f, as required by the theorem.\n",
