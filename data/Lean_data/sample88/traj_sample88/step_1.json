    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orAndAbsorb:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem states that P ∨ (P ∧ Q) ↔ P for any propositions P and Q.\n   - We need to prove both directions of the bi-implication (↔).\n\n2. Break down the proof into two parts:\n   a) Forward direction: P ∨ (P ∧ Q) → P\n   b) Backward direction: P → P ∨ (P ∧ Q)\n\n3. For the forward direction (P ∨ (P ∧ Q) → P):\n   - Use case analysis on the left-hand side (P ∨ (P ∧ Q))\n   - For the case P, it's trivial as P implies P\n   - For the case (P ∧ Q), we can extract P from the conjunction\n\n4. For the backward direction (P → P ∨ (P ∧ Q)):\n   - This is a simple application of the disjunction introduction rule\n   - P directly implies the left side of the disjunction P ∨ (P ∧ Q)\n\n5. Combine both directions to complete the bi-implication proof\n\n6. Use appropriate tactics in Lean 4:\n   - apply Iff.intro for the bi-implication\n   - use intro for introducing hypotheses\n   - apply Or.elim for case analysis\n   - use And.left for extracting P from P ∧ Q\n   - apply Or.inl for disjunction introduction\n\n7. Ensure all cases are covered and the proof is complete\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and suggesting relevant Lean 4 tactics to use during the proof process.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. For the forward direction (P ∨ (P ∧ Q) → P):\n   - Replace 'sorry' with 'cases h' to perform case analysis on h : P ∨ P ∧ Q\n   - This will generate two cases:\n     a) h : P - In this case, we already have P, so we can use 'exact h' to prove the goal\n     b) h : P ∧ Q - In this case, we need to extract P from the conjunction using 'exact h.left'\n\n2. For the backward direction (P → P ∨ P ∧ Q):\n   - Replace 'sorry' with 'apply Or.inl' or simply 'left'\n   - This directly proves that P implies the left side of the disjunction P ∨ (P ∧ Q)\n\n3. After implementing these steps, the proof should be complete without any 'sorry' tactics\n\nRemember to use appropriate Lean 4 syntax and tactics for each step. The acting agent should focus on implementing these specific proof strategies for each direction to provide a complete and rigorous proof of the theorem.\n",
