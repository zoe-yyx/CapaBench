    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem fixpoint_self_comp, we need to show that if x is a fixpoint of f, then x is also a fixpoint of (f ∘ f). Let's break this down into steps:\n\n1. First, we should unfold the definition of is_fixpoint in the goal. This will give us a concrete equality to work with.\n\n2. Next, we should expand the definition of Zcomp. This will show us explicitly what (f ∘ f)(x) means in terms of function composition.\n\n3. After expanding these definitions, we'll have a goal that looks something like:\n   f (f x) = x\n\n4. We can use the hypothesis h, which states that x is a fixpoint of f. This means f x = x.\n\n5. We can use this equality to rewrite the inner function application in our goal.\n\n6. After this rewriting, we'll have:\n   f x = x\n\n7. But this is exactly what our hypothesis h states, so we can use it directly to prove the goal.\n\nGiven these steps, I suggest the acting agent start by unfolding the definitions of is_fixpoint and Zcomp, then use the hypothesis h to rewrite the goal, and finally use h again to prove the resulting equality.\n",
