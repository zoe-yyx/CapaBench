Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: mul n (succ zero) = n\n   - We need to prove this for any natural number n\n   - We have definitions for add and mul\n   - We have two potentially useful theorems: mul_comm and mul_one_left\n\n2. Choose Proof Strategy:\n   - Induction on n seems appropriate, as mul is defined recursively\n\n3. Outline the Proof:\n   a. Base case: Prove for n = zero\n   b. Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for succ n\n\n4. Utilize Available Theorems:\n   - mul_comm might be useful to switch the order of multiplication\n   - mul_one_left could be used if we can switch the order of multiplication\n\n5. Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof by induction on n\n   b. For the base case (n = zero):\n      - Expand the definition of mul\n      - Simplify\n   c. For the inductive step:\n      - Assume the theorem holds for n (induction hypothesis)\n      - Prove for succ n\n      - Use the definition of mul for succ n\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use properties of succ and add to simplify\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - Ensure each step is justified\n   - Check if the proof can be simplified or made more elegant\n   - Verify that all cases are covered\n\n7. Finalization:\n   - Review the complete proof\n   - Ensure all steps are logically connected\n   - Confirm the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof structure using induction is correct, and the base case has been handled properly. For the inductive step, we need to modify our approach to avoid syntax errors and make the proof more explicit. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Keep the induction structure and the base case as they are.\n\n2. For the inductive step, we should transform the goal step by step using rewrite (rw) and simplify (simp) tactics instead of using a calc block. This approach will make each transformation explicit and easier to verify.\n\n3. The goal is to prove: mul (succ k) (succ zero) = succ k\n\n4. Steps for the inductive case:\n   a. First, rewrite the left-hand side using the definition of mul for the succ case:\n      rw [mul]\n      This should transform the goal to: add (succ zero) (mul k (succ zero)) = succ k\n\n   b. Next, use the induction hypothesis (ih) to replace mul k (succ zero) with k:\n      rw [ih]\n      This should transform the goal to: add (succ zero) k = succ k\n\n   c. Finally, simplify the left-hand side using the definition of add:\n      simp [add]\n      This should complete the proof as it will simplify to: succ k = succ k\n\n5. After these steps, the proof should be complete, and Lean should accept it without errors.\n\nThis approach breaks down the proof into clear, manageable steps, making it easier to understand and verify. It also avoids the syntax issues encountered with the calc block in Lean 4.\n",
