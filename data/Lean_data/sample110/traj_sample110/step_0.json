Analyze the Problem:\n   - The theorem states: mul n (succ zero) = n\n   - We need to prove this for any natural number n\n   - We have definitions for add and mul\n   - We have two potentially useful theorems: mul_comm and mul_one_left\n\n2. Choose Proof Strategy:\n   - Induction on n seems appropriate, as mul is defined recursively\n\n3. Outline the Proof:\n   a. Base case: Prove for n = zero\n   b. Inductive step: Assume true for n, prove for succ n\n\n4. Utilize Available Theorems:\n   - mul_comm might be useful to switch the order of multiplication\n   - mul_one_left could be used if we can switch the order of multiplication\n\n5. Proof Steps:\n   a. Start the proof by induction on n\n   b. For the base case (n = zero):\n      - Expand the definition of mul\n      - Simplify\n   c. For the inductive step:\n      - Assume the theorem holds for n (induction hypothesis)\n      - Prove for succ n\n      - Use the definition of mul for succ n\n      - Apply the induction hypothesis\n      - Use properties of succ and add to simplify\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mul_one_right (n : Nat) : mul n (succ zero) = n, we should follow the induction strategy outlined in the plan. Here's the reasoning for the initial steps:\n\n1. Start with induction on n:\n   - This is appropriate because mul is defined recursively on its first argument.\n   - We need to prove the theorem for all natural numbers, and induction is a powerful tool for this.\n\n2. Begin with the base case (n = zero):\n   - We need to prove: mul zero (succ zero) = zero\n   - This will involve expanding the definition of mul for the zero case.\n\n3. Then move to the inductive step:\n   - Assume the theorem holds for some k: mul k (succ zero) = k (induction hypothesis)\n   - We need to prove it holds for succ k: mul (succ k) (succ zero) = succ k\n\n4. For each step, we'll need to:\n   - Use the definitions of mul and add\n   - Simplify expressions\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis when appropriate\n\nGiven that we're starting from scratch, the acting agent should begin by setting up the induction proof structure. This involves:\n\na) Initiating the induction on n\nb) Defining the base case\nc) Setting up the inductive step\n\nThe acting agent should focus on these initial structuring steps to lay the foundation for the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current outcome, here's my reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but there's a syntax error in the final calculation step.\n\nImprovement: Replace the calculation block with a step-by-step proof using 'rw' and 'simp' tactics to avoid syntax errors and clearly show each transformation.\n```\n\nThe proof structure using induction is correct, and the base case has been handled properly. The inductive step is also set up correctly. However, the error occurs in the final calculation block, which is not properly formatted for Lean 4.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Keep the induction structure and the base case as they are.\n2. For the inductive step, instead of using a calculation block, use a series of 'rw' (rewrite) and 'simp' (simplify) tactics to transform the goal step by step.\n3. Start by rewriting the goal using the definition of mul for the succ case.\n4. Then use the induction hypothesis (ih) to replace mul k (succ zero) with k.\n5. Finally, use the definition of add to simplify the expression to succ k.\n\nThis approach will make each step of the proof explicit and avoid syntax errors. It will also make the proof more readable and easier to verify. The acting agent should focus on implementing these steps in the inductive case of the proof.",
