Understand the given definitions:\n   - Recall the definition of 'mono' for integer functions\n   - Understand 'func_plus' as the pointwise addition of two functions\n\n2. Unpack the goal:\n   - We need to prove that (func_plus f g) is monotonic\n   - This means showing: ∀ n m, n ≤ m → (func_plus f g) n ≤ (func_plus f g) m\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Start by introducing arbitrary integers n and m\n   - Assume n ≤ m as the hypothesis\n\n4. Expand the definition of func_plus:\n   - Rewrite (func_plus f g) n as f n + g n\n   - Rewrite (func_plus f g) m as f m + g m\n\n5. Use the monotonicity of f and g:\n   - Apply hf to get f n ≤ f m\n   - Apply hg to get g n ≤ g m\n\n6. Combine the inequalities:\n   - Use the fact that if a ≤ b and c ≤ d, then a + c ≤ b + d\n   - This will show that (f n + g n) ≤ (f m + g m)\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The last step directly proves the goal for arbitrary n and m\n   - This establishes the monotonicity of (func_plus f g)\n\n8. Optional: Consider using linarith tactic:\n   - The problem imports Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith\n   - This tactic might be useful for handling the inequalities\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the monotonicity of the sum of two monotonic functions, leveraging the given hypotheses and definitions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nWe have successfully introduced the variables and expanded the definition of func_plus. Now, our goal is to prove that f n + g n ≤ f m + g m, given that n ≤ m and both f and g are monotonic.\n\nThe next logical steps should be:\n\n1. Apply the monotonicity of f:\n   - We know that f is monotonic (hf : mono f) and n ≤ m (hnm : n ≤ m)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that f n ≤ f m\n\n2. Apply the monotonicity of g:\n   - Similarly, g is monotonic (hg : mono g) and n ≤ m (hnm : n ≤ m)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that g n ≤ g m\n\n3. Combine these inequalities:\n   - We now have f n ≤ f m and g n ≤ g m\n   - We need to show that their sum also maintains the inequality\n\n4. Use the property of inequality addition:\n   - If a ≤ b and c ≤ d, then a + c ≤ b + d\n   - This property will allow us to conclude that f n + g n ≤ f m + g m\n\nTo implement these steps, we should:\n1. Use the 'have' tactic to state and prove f n ≤ f m and g n ≤ g m\n2. Use the 'linarith' tactic to combine these inequalities and prove the final goal\n\nThis approach directly follows our plan and should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
