Understand the given definitions:\n   - Recall the definition of 'mono' for integer functions\n   - Understand 'func_plus' as the pointwise addition of two functions\n\n2. Unpack the goal:\n   - We need to prove that (func_plus f g) is monotonic\n   - This means showing: ∀ n m, n ≤ m → (func_plus f g) n ≤ (func_plus f g) m\n\n3. Set up the proof:\n   - Start by introducing arbitrary integers n and m\n   - Assume n ≤ m as the hypothesis\n\n4. Expand the definition of func_plus:\n   - Rewrite (func_plus f g) n as f n + g n\n   - Rewrite (func_plus f g) m as f m + g m\n\n5. Use the monotonicity of f and g:\n   - Apply hf to get f n ≤ f m\n   - Apply hg to get g n ≤ g m\n\n6. Combine the inequalities:\n   - Use the fact that if a ≤ b and c ≤ d, then a + c ≤ b + d\n   - This will show that (f n + g n) ≤ (f m + g m)\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The last step directly proves the goal for arbitrary n and m\n   - This establishes the monotonicity of (func_plus f g)\n\n8. Optional: Consider using linarith tactic:\n   - The problem imports Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith\n   - This tactic might be useful for handling the inequalities\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the monotonicity of the sum of two monotonic functions, leveraging the given hypotheses and definitions.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by setting up the basic structure of the proof as outlined in the planning strategy. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Begin by introducing arbitrary integers n and m, and assume n ≤ m. This sets up the context for proving the monotonicity of (func_plus f g).\n\n2. We need to show that (func_plus f g) n ≤ (func_plus f g) m under this assumption.\n\n3. To do this, we should first expand the definition of func_plus. This will allow us to work with the concrete expressions f n + g n and f m + g m.\n\n4. After expanding the definition, we can use the monotonicity properties of f and g (given by hf and hg) to establish that f n ≤ f m and g n ≤ g m.\n\n5. Once we have these inequalities, we can combine them to show that f n + g n ≤ f m + g m, which is equivalent to our goal.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on introducing the variables, stating the assumption, and expanding the definition of func_plus as the next steps in the proof.\n",
