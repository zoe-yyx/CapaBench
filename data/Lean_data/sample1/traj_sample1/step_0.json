Analyze the given information:\n   - We have two variables: C (chickens) and R (rabbits)\n   - Two equations are provided:\n     h1: C + R = 35 (total number of animals)\n     h2: 2*C + 4*R = 94 (total number of legs)\n\n2. Develop a strategy to solve the system of equations:\n   - Use the substitution method to eliminate one variable\n   - Express R in terms of C using h1\n   - Substitute this expression into h2\n\n3. Solve for C:\n   - Simplify the resulting equation\n   - Use linarith tactic to solve the linear equation\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Check if C = 23 satisfies both original equations\n   - Use linarith or calc to confirm\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - Assert that C = 23\n   - Use rfl tactic for reflexivity\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- The import of Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith suggests that the linarith tactic will be useful\n- The problem is straightforward algebraic manipulation, so focus on clear step-by-step reasoning\n- Be prepared to use basic arithmetic operations and simplification tactics\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo solve this theorem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach using the equations provided in the hypotheses. Let's start by expressing R in terms of C using the first equation (h1).\n\n1. From h1: C + R = 35, we can derive R = 35 - C\n\n2. Now, we need to substitute this expression for R into the second equation (h2):\n   2*C + 4*R = 94\n   2*C + 4*(35 - C) = 94\n\n3. The next step is to simplify this equation:\n   2*C + 140 - 4*C = 94\n   -2*C + 140 = 94\n\n4. Subtract 140 from both sides:\n   -2*C = -46\n\n5. Divide both sides by -2:\n   C = 23\n\nWe have now derived that C = 23, which is exactly what we need to prove. However, we need to formalize this reasoning in Lean 4.\n\nThe acting agent should start by:\n1. Introducing the substitution R = 35 - C\n2. Rewriting h2 using this substitution\n3. Using linarith tactic to solve the resulting linear equation\n\nThis approach will set up the problem in a way that Lean can easily verify the solution.\n",
