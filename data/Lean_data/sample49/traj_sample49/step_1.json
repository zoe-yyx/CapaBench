    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem proj1:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is named \"proj1\"\n   - It involves two propositions P and Q\n   - The goal is to prove: P ∧ Q → P\n\n2. Understand the logical statement:\n   - We need to show that if P ∧ Q is true, then P is true\n   - This is essentially extracting the first component of a conjunction\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (P ∧ Q)\n   - Use the hypothesis to extract P\n   - Conclude that P is true\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the hypothesis\n   - Use 'cases' or 'match' to deconstruct the conjunction\n   - Use 'exact' or 'assumption' to conclude the proof\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the conjunction\n   - Avoid unnecessary steps that might complicate the proof\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof uses only the given hypothesis and no additional assumptions\n\nThis plan provides a straightforward approach to proving the theorem, focusing on the key logical steps required to extract P from P ∧ Q.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we can reason about the next step as follows:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis (P ∧ Q) using the 'intro' tactic, which is now represented by 'h' in our context.\n\n2. Our current goal is to prove P, given that we have h : P ∧ Q in our context.\n\n3. The next logical step is to extract the P component from the conjunction P ∧ Q.\n\n4. In Lean 4, we can use the 'cases' tactic to deconstruct a conjunction. This will give us direct access to both P and Q separately.\n\n5. After using 'cases', we should have P in our context, which directly proves our goal.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning suggests that we should use the 'cases' tactic on our hypothesis h to extract P, which will then allow us to immediately conclude the proof.\n",
