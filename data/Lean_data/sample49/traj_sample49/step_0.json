Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is named \"proj1\"\n   - It involves two propositions P and Q\n   - The goal is to prove: P ∧ Q → P\n\n2. Understand the logical statement:\n   - We need to show that if P ∧ Q is true, then P is true\n   - This is essentially extracting the first component of a conjunction\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (P ∧ Q)\n   - Use the hypothesis to extract P\n   - Conclude that P is true\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce the hypothesis\n   - Use 'cases' or 'match' to deconstruct the conjunction\n   - Use 'exact' or 'assumption' to conclude the proof\n\n5. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure correct handling of the conjunction\n   - Avoid unnecessary steps that might complicate the proof\n\n6. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof uses only the given hypothesis and no additional assumptions\n\nThis plan provides a straightforward approach to proving the theorem, focusing on the key logical steps required to extract P from P ∧ Q.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof has not yet begun, so we need to start by introducing the hypothesis. The theorem states \"P ∧ Q → P\", which means we're assuming P ∧ Q and need to prove P. \n\nReasoning for the next step:\n\n1. We should use the 'intro' tactic to introduce the hypothesis P ∧ Q into our local context. This will allow us to work with the assumption and extract P from it.\n\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we'll have a local variable (let's call it h) of type P ∧ Q in our context, and our goal will be to prove P.\n\n3. The 'intro' tactic is a fundamental first step in proving implications, as it allows us to work with the left-hand side of the implication as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the 'intro' tactic as the first step in this proof. This will set up the proof environment correctly for the subsequent steps of extracting P from the conjunction P ∧ Q.\n",
