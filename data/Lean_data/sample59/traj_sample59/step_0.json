Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is about distributing existential quantifiers over conjunction.\n   - We need to prove: (∃ x, P x ∧ Q x) → (∃ x, P x) ∧ (∃ x, Q x)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with an intro step to bring the hypothesis into the local context.\n   - The goal will then be to prove a conjunction: (∃ x, P x) ∧ (∃ x, Q x)\n\n3. Handle the conjunction in the goal:\n   - Use the 'constructor' tactic to split the goal into two subgoals:\n     a) ∃ x, P x\n     b) ∃ x, Q x\n\n4. Prove the first subgoal (∃ x, P x):\n   - Use the 'cases' tactic on the hypothesis to extract the witness and properties.\n   - Use 'exists' tactic with the extracted witness.\n   - Prove P holds for this witness using the extracted property.\n\n5. Prove the second subgoal (∃ x, Q x):\n   - Similar to step 4, but focus on proving Q for the same witness.\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed.\n   - If any steps are unclear, consider adding comments or breaking them down further.\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any alternative proof strategies.\n   - Think about how this theorem might be useful in other contexts.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the start of the proof, our first step should be to introduce the hypothesis into our local context. This aligns with step 2 of our planning strategy.\n\nReasoning:\n1. We start with a theorem of the form A → B, where A is (∃ x, P x ∧ Q x) and B is (∃ x, P x) ∧ (∃ x, Q x).\n2. In Lean 4, when we have an implication as our goal, it's standard practice to use the 'intro' tactic to bring the left-hand side (the hypothesis) into our local context.\n3. This will allow us to work with the existential quantifier in our hypothesis, which we'll need to prove both parts of our conjunction in the goal.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent use the 'intro' tactic to bring the hypothesis (∃ x, P x ∧ Q x) into the local context. This will set us up for the next steps in our proof strategy, particularly steps 3 and 4 in our plan.\n",
