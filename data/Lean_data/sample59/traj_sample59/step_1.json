Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is about distributing existential quantifiers over conjunction.\n   - We need to prove: (∃ x, P x ∧ Q x) → (∃ x, P x) ∧ (∃ x, Q x)\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start with an intro step to bring the hypothesis into the local context.\n   - The goal will then be to prove a conjunction: (∃ x, P x) ∧ (∃ x, Q x)\n\n3. Handle the conjunction in the goal:\n   - Use the 'constructor' tactic to split the goal into two subgoals:\n     a) ∃ x, P x\n     b) ∃ x, Q x\n\n4. Prove the first subgoal (∃ x, P x):\n   - Use the 'cases' tactic on the hypothesis to extract the witness and properties.\n   - Use 'exists' tactic with the extracted witness.\n   - Prove P holds for this witness using the extracted property.\n\n5. Prove the second subgoal (∃ x, Q x):\n   - Similar to step 4, but focus on proving Q for the same witness.\n\n6. Finalize the proof:\n   - Ensure all goals are closed.\n   - If any steps are unclear, consider adding comments or breaking them down further.\n\n7. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any alternative proof strategies.\n   - Think about how this theorem might be useful in other contexts.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we are now at step 3 of our plan. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis into the local context using the 'intro h' tactic. Now, our goal is to prove the conjunction (∃ x, P x) ∧ (∃ x, Q x).\n\nTo proceed, we should use the 'constructor' tactic to split this conjunction into two subgoals. This aligns with our plan and will allow us to tackle each existential statement separately.\n\nAfter applying the 'constructor' tactic, we expect to have two subgoals:\n1. ∃ x, P x\n2. ∃ x, Q x\n\nOnce these subgoals are created, we can proceed to step 4 of our plan, which involves handling the first subgoal by extracting the witness from our hypothesis 'h'.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in our proving process is to apply the 'constructor' tactic.\n",
