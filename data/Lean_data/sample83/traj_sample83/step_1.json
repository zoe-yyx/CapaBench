    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem orDup (P : Prop) : P ∨ P ↔ P\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that for any proposition P, P ∨ P (P or P) is logically equivalent to P.\n   - We need to prove both directions of the biconditional (↔).\n\n2. Structure the proof:\n   - Use the `apply Iff.intro` tactic to split the proof into two directions:\n     a) (→) P ∨ P → P\n     b) (←) P → P ∨ P\n\n3. Prove the forward direction (P ∨ P → P):\n   - Use `intro h` to introduce the hypothesis.\n   - Apply `cases h` to consider both cases of the disjunction.\n   - For both cases, the result will directly be P.\n\n4. Prove the reverse direction (P → P ∨ P):\n   - Use `intro h` to introduce the hypothesis.\n   - Apply `apply Or.inl` or `apply Or.inr` to construct the disjunction.\n   - Use the hypothesis `h` to prove either case.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The `sorry` tactic should not be needed as this proof can be completed with basic tactics.\n   - Ensure all goals are closed before finishing the proof.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the theorem, considering both directions of the biconditional and using appropriate tactics for handling disjunctions and implications in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the forward direction (P ∨ P → P):\n1. Use `intro h` to bring the hypothesis P ∨ P into the context.\n2. Apply `cases h with hp hp` to perform case analysis on the disjunction.\n3. For both cases, the goal will be to prove P, which is exactly what we have in the context, so we can use `exact hp` for each case.\n\nFor the reverse direction (P → P ∨ P):\n1. Use `intro h` to bring the hypothesis P into the context.\n2. Apply `apply Or.inl` to choose the left side of the disjunction.\n3. Use `exact h` to prove P using the hypothesis.\n\nThis approach will replace the `sorry` tactics with proper proof steps, completing the proof rigorously for both directions of the biconditional.\n",
