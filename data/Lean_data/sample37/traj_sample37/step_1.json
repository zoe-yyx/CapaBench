    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We're working with an inductive type 'Tree' with two constructors: leaf and node.\n   - The theorem 'nodeInjRight' aims to prove that if two nodes are equal, their right subtrees are equal.\n\n2. Understand the theorem structure:\n   - Input: Two pairs of trees (l1, r1) and (l2, r2), and two integer values v1 and v2.\n   - Hypothesis: node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2\n   - Goal: Prove r1 = r2\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start with the equality of the nodes: node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2\n   b. Use the fact that 'node' is an injective constructor:\n      - If node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2, then l1 = l2, v1 = v2, and r1 = r2\n   c. Focus on extracting the equality of right subtrees (r1 = r2) from the node equality\n\n4. Possible tactics to use:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - injection: to apply injectivity of the 'node' constructor\n   - rw: to rewrite equalities\n   - exact: to prove the goal when it matches the hypothesis exactly\n\n5. Outline of the proof:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis\n   b. Apply injection to the hypothesis to get individual equalities\n   c. Extract the equality r1 = r2\n   d. Use this equality to prove the goal\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring the correct application of the injection tactic\n   - Properly handling the multiple equalities generated by injection\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof relies only on the given hypothesis and the properties of the 'Tree' type\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure is logically correct, but we need to adjust our tactics to align with Lean 4's syntax and behavior. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We've already introduced the hypothesis with 'intro h', which is correct.\n\n2. Instead of using 'injection', we should use the 'cases' tactic to decompose the equality. This will generate the equalities we need, including r1 = r2.\n\n3. After using 'cases', the goal r1 = r2 should already be one of the generated equalities.\n\n4. We can then use the 'assumption' tactic to complete the proof, as it will match the goal with one of the generated equalities.\n\nThis approach maintains the logical structure of our original proof while adapting to Lean 4's specific syntax and behavior. It should resolve the \"no goals to be solved\" error and successfully prove the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The 'cases' tactic simplified the equality to a reflexivity case, leaving us with the goal r1 = r1, which the 'assumption' tactic cannot solve directly.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'assumption' tactic with 'rfl' to prove the reflexive equality r1 = r1, which should complete the proof successfully.\n```\n\nThe current approach was close, but we overlooked a subtle point in how Lean 4 handles the 'cases' tactic on equalities. When we used 'cases' on the equality hypothesis, it simplified the problem to a reflexivity case, effectively replacing all instances of the right-hand side with the left-hand side. This left us with the goal of proving r1 = r1, which is a reflexive equality.\n\nThe 'assumption' tactic looks for a hypothesis that exactly matches the goal, which we don't have in this case. Instead, we need to use a tactic that can prove reflexive equalities directly.\n\nFor the next step, we should keep the same structure up to the 'cases' tactic, but then use 'rfl' instead of 'assumption'. The 'rfl' tactic is designed to prove reflexive equalities, which is exactly what we need in this situation.\n\nThis adjustment should successfully complete the proof while maintaining the logical structure we intended. It also aligns well with Lean 4's proof style and makes use of its built-in tactics for handling basic logical principles like reflexivity.",
