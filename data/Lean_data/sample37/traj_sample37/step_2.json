    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We're working with an inductive type 'Tree' with two constructors: leaf and node.\n   - The theorem 'nodeInjRight' aims to prove that if two nodes are equal, their right subtrees are equal.\n\n2. Understand the theorem structure:\n   - Input: Two pairs of trees (l1, r1) and (l2, r2), and two integer values v1 and v2.\n   - Hypothesis: node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2\n   - Goal: Prove r1 = r2\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start with the equality of the nodes: node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2\n   b. Use the fact that 'node' is an injective constructor:\n      - If node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2, then l1 = l2, v1 = v2, and r1 = r2\n   c. Focus on extracting the equality of right subtrees (r1 = r2) from the node equality\n\n4. Possible tactics to use:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - injection: to apply injectivity of the 'node' constructor\n   - rw: to rewrite equalities\n   - exact: to prove the goal when it matches the hypothesis exactly\n\n5. Outline of the proof:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis\n   b. Apply injection to the hypothesis to get individual equalities\n   c. Extract the equality r1 = r2\n   d. Use this equality to prove the goal\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring the correct application of the injection tactic\n   - Properly handling the multiple equalities generated by injection\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof relies only on the given hypothesis and the properties of the 'Tree' type\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof structure is correct up to the 'cases' tactic. The 'cases' tactic on the equality hypothesis has simplified our goal to proving a reflexive equality r1 = r1. To complete the proof, we need to use a tactic that can directly prove reflexive equalities.\n\nThe 'rfl' tactic in Lean 4 is specifically designed for this purpose. It proves goals of the form t = t for any term t, which is exactly what we need here.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to replace the 'assumption' tactic with 'rfl'. This will directly prove the reflexive equality r1 = r1 and complete our proof.\n\nThe complete proof structure should look like this:\n1. intro h  (to introduce the hypothesis)\n2. cases h  (to break down the equality)\n3. rfl      (to prove the resulting reflexive equality)\n\nThis approach maintains the logical flow of the proof while correctly handling the simplified goal produced by the 'cases' tactic.\n",
