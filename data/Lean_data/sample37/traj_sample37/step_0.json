    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We're working with an inductive type 'Tree' with two constructors: leaf and node.\n   - The theorem 'nodeInjRight' aims to prove that if two nodes are equal, their right subtrees are equal.\n\n2. Understand the theorem structure:\n   - Input: Two pairs of trees (l1, r1) and (l2, r2), and two integer values v1 and v2.\n   - Hypothesis: node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2\n   - Goal: Prove r1 = r2\n\n3. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start with the equality of the nodes: node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2\n   b. Use the fact that 'node' is an injective constructor:\n      - If node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2, then l1 = l2, v1 = v2, and r1 = r2\n   c. Focus on extracting the equality of right subtrees (r1 = r2) from the node equality\n\n4. Possible tactics to use:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - injection: to apply injectivity of the 'node' constructor\n   - rw: to rewrite equalities\n   - exact: to prove the goal when it matches the hypothesis exactly\n\n5. Outline of the proof:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis\n   b. Apply injection to the hypothesis to get individual equalities\n   c. Extract the equality r1 = r2\n   d. Use this equality to prove the goal\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensuring the correct application of the injection tactic\n   - Properly handling the multiple equalities generated by injection\n\n7. Verification:\n   - After completing the proof, ensure that all goals are closed\n   - Check that the proof relies only on the given hypothesis and the properties of the 'Tree' type\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof for the theorem 'nodeInjRight' should begin by introducing the hypothesis and then using the injection tactic to leverage the injectivity of the 'node' constructor. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should start by introducing the hypothesis. The theorem statement implies that we have an equality between two 'node' constructors, and we need to prove that their right subtrees are equal.\n\n2. After introducing the hypothesis, we should use the injection tactic. This tactic is crucial because it will break down the equality of the 'node' constructors into equalities of their components (left subtrees, values, and right subtrees).\n\n3. The injection tactic will generate three separate equalities: one for the left subtrees (l1 = l2), one for the values (v1 = v2), and one for the right subtrees (r1 = r2).\n\n4. Among these generated equalities, we're particularly interested in the equality of the right subtrees (r1 = r2), as this is exactly what we need to prove for our theorem.\n\n5. Once we have this equality, we can use it directly to prove our goal, as it matches exactly what we need to show.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should focus on introducing the hypothesis, applying the injection tactic, and then identifying and using the relevant equality to complete the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof is correct, but the tactic 'injection' is causing an issue due to how it's being used in Lean 4.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'injection' tactic with 'cases h' to decompose the equality, then use 'assumption' to complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe current proof approach is logically correct, but there's a compatibility issue with how the 'injection' tactic is being used in Lean 4. In Lean 4, the behavior of 'injection' has changed compared to Lean 3, which is causing the \"no goals to be solved\" error.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should adjust our tactics to align with Lean 4's syntax and behavior. Instead of using 'injection', we can use the 'cases' tactic to decompose the equality. This will generate the same equalities we need, including the one for the right subtrees.\n\nHere's a suggested improvement for the acting agent:\n\n1. Start with 'intro h' as before to introduce the hypothesis.\n2. Use 'cases h' instead of 'injection' to decompose the equality.\n3. The 'cases' tactic will automatically generate the equality we need (r1 = r2).\n4. Use 'assumption' to complete the proof, as the goal will match one of the generated equalities.\n\nThis approach should work smoothly in Lean 4 and avoid the issues encountered with the 'injection' tactic. It maintains the logical structure of the proof while adapting to Lean 4's syntax and behavior.",
