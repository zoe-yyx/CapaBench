    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem mono_compose, we should follow the structure outlined in the planning strategy. The first step is to set up the proof by introducing the hypotheses and expanding the goal.\n\n1. We should start by introducing the hypotheses that f and g are monotonic functions. This can be done using the `intro` tactic.\n\n2. Next, we need to expand the definition of `mono` for the composition `Zcomp f g`. This involves showing that for any two integers n and m, if n ≤ m, then (Zcomp f g) n ≤ (Zcomp f g) m.\n\n3. To prove this, we should introduce two arbitrary integers n and m, and assume n ≤ m. This can also be done using the `intro` tactic.\n\n4. After setting up these initial conditions, we'll need to expand the definition of `Zcomp` and use the monotonicity of both f and g to complete the proof.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I suggest the acting agent start with the following steps:\n\n1. Use `intro` to introduce the hypotheses for f and g being monotonic.\n2. Use `intro` again to introduce arbitrary integers n and m, and the assumption n ≤ m.\n3. Begin to work with the expanded goal, focusing on showing (Zcomp f g) n ≤ (Zcomp f g) m.\n\nThese initial steps will set up the proof structure and allow us to proceed with applying the monotonicity properties of f and g in subsequent steps.\n",
