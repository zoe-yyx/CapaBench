Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p)\n   - This is the right distributive property of multiplication over addition\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Use induction on 'n', as the definitions of 'add' and 'mul' are recursive on the first argument\n\n3. Set up the induction:\n   - Base case: n = 0\n   - Inductive step: Assume the property holds for n, prove for (succ n)\n\n4. Prove the base case:\n   - Simplify mul (add 0 m) p\n   - Simplify add (mul 0 p) (mul m p)\n   - Show these are equal\n\n5. Prove the inductive step:\n   - Assume: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p)\n   - Goal: mul (add (succ n) m) p = add (mul (succ n) p) (mul m p)\n   - Use the definitions of 'add' and 'mul' to expand both sides\n   - Use the induction hypothesis\n   - Use the addAssoc theorem to rearrange terms\n   - Show that both sides are equal\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\n1. The main issue we're facing is the need to prove the equality:\n   add p (add (mul n p) (mul m p)) = add (add p (mul n p)) (mul m p)\n\n2. This equality is a direct application of the associativity of addition (addAssoc theorem). However, we can't use it directly because it's currently marked with 'sorry'.\n\n3. Our first priority should be to prove the addAssoc theorem rigorously. This will likely require its own induction proof.\n\n4. Once addAssoc is proven, we can use it to complete the proof of mulAddDistrR. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n   a. Apply the addAssoc theorem to the left side of our current goal:\n      rw [addAssoc p (mul n p) (mul m p)]\n      This will transform the left side to: add (add p (mul n p)) (mul m p)\n\n   b. After this transformation, both sides of the equation should be identical, and the proof will be complete.\n\n5. If any additional lemmas or properties of addition are needed during this process, we should prove them as well.\n\n6. Remember to use Lean 4 syntax and tactics throughout the proof, such as 'rw' for rewriting and 'simp' for simplification.\n\n7. After completing the proof, we should remove all 'sorry' statements to ensure the theorem is fully and rigorously proven.\n\nThe acting agent should focus on implementing these steps, starting with the proof of addAssoc if it hasn't been done already.\n",
