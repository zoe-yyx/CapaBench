Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p)\n   - This is the right distributive property of multiplication over addition\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Use induction on 'n', as the definitions of 'add' and 'mul' are recursive on the first argument\n\n3. Set up the induction:\n   - Base case: n = 0\n   - Inductive step: Assume the property holds for n, prove for (succ n)\n\n4. Prove the base case:\n   - Simplify mul (add 0 m) p\n   - Simplify add (mul 0 p) (mul m p)\n   - Show these are equal\n\n5. Prove the inductive step:\n   - Assume: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p)\n   - Goal: mul (add (succ n) m) p = add (mul (succ n) p) (mul m p)\n   - Use the definitions of 'add' and 'mul' to expand both sides\n   - Use the induction hypothesis\n   - Use the addAssoc theorem to rearrange terms\n   - Show that both sides are equal\n\n6.

    "reasoning": "\nTo address the issues in the current proof attempt and make progress towards proving the theorem mulAddDistrR, we should:\n\n1. Correct the induction syntax to properly handle both cases (zero and succ) in Lean 4 style.\n2. Simplify the base case using simp tactics instead of explicit calc blocks.\n3. Implement the inductive step by:\n   a. Expanding the definitions of add and mul\n   b. Applying the induction hypothesis\n   c. Rearranging terms using the properties of addition (associativity and commutativity)\n4. Use simp tactics and rw tactics strategically to simplify expressions and rewrite equations.\n5. If needed, prove auxiliary lemmas for add and mul properties to assist in the main proof.\n\nThe next step should focus on rewriting the induction structure and implementing the inductive step. We'll guide the acting agent to start with the correct induction syntax and then proceed with the proof for both cases.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof is incomplete, relying on 'sorry' to conclude the inductive step, and it lacks the necessary manipulation of addition terms to complete the equality.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'sorry' with explicit steps to rearrange the addition terms using addAssoc and other properties of addition, potentially proving auxiliary lemmas if needed.\n```\n\nTo elaborate on the improvement:\n\n1. We've successfully set up the induction and simplified the base case and inductive step. However, we're stuck at the final equality in the inductive step.\n\n2. The current goal is to prove:\n   `add p (add (mul n p) (mul m p)) = add (add p (mul n p)) (mul m p)`\n\n3. This is essentially an application of the associativity of addition. We should use the addAssoc theorem (which is currently marked with 'sorry') to rewrite the left side of the equation.\n\n4. If addAssoc is not available (since it's currently using 'sorry'), we should first prove it rigorously, removing the 'sorry' statement. This might involve another induction proof on its own.\n\n5. After applying addAssoc, the proof should be complete, as both sides of the equation will be identical.\n\n6. In future steps, we should focus on:\n   a. Proving addAssoc if it's not already proven.\n   b. Applying addAssoc to complete the proof of mulAddDistrR.\n   c. Using rw tactics to apply the necessary theorems and complete the equality.\n\nBy addressing these points, we can complete the proof without relying on 'sorry' and demonstrate the theorem rigorously in Lean 4.",
