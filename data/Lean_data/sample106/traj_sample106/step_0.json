    "planning_context": "\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p)\n   - This is the right distributive property of multiplication over addition\n\n2. Choose the proof method:\n   - Use induction on 'n', as the definitions of 'add' and 'mul' are recursive on the first argument\n\n3. Set up the induction:\n   - Base case: n = 0\n   - Inductive step: Assume the property holds for n, prove for (succ n)\n\n4. Prove the base case:\n   - Simplify mul (add 0 m) p\n   - Simplify add (mul 0 p) (mul m p)\n   - Show these are equal\n\n5. Prove the inductive step:\n   - Assume: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p)\n   - Goal: mul (add (succ n) m) p = add (mul (succ n) p) (mul m p)\n   - Use the definitions of 'add' and 'mul' to expand both sides\n   - Use the induction hypothesis\n   - Use the addAssoc theorem to rearrange terms\n   - Show that both sides are equal\n\n6. Apply induction:\n   - Conclude that the property holds for all natural numbers\n\n7. Use auxiliary theorems and lemmas:\n   - Utilize the addAssoc theorem when rearranging terms\n\n8.

    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem mulAddDistrR, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with induction on 'n':\n   - Use the 'induction' tactic to set up the proof structure.\n   - This will give us two goals: the base case (n = 0) and the inductive step.\n\n2. For the base case (n = 0):\n   - We need to prove: mul (add 0 m) p = add (mul 0 p) (mul m p)\n   - Use the definition of 'add' to simplify the left side: mul m p\n   - Use the definition of 'mul' to simplify the right side: add 0 (mul m p)\n   - These should be equal by the definition of 'add'\n\n3. For the inductive step:\n   - We have the induction hypothesis: mul (add n m) p = add (mul n p) (mul m p)\n   - We need to prove: mul (add (succ n) m) p = add (mul (succ n) p) (mul m p)\n   - Use the definitions of 'add' and 'mul' to expand both sides\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis\n   - Use the addAssoc theorem to rearrange terms\n\n4. Throughout the proof:\n   - Use Lean 4 tactics like 'rw' (rewrite), 'simp' (simplify), and 'calc' (calculation) to manipulate equations\n   - Use 'rfl' (reflexivity) for trivial equalities\n   - Apply the addAssoc theorem when needed using the 'rw' tactic\n\nStart by setting up the induction on 'n' and focus on proving the base case first.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is incomplete, lacking the full implementation of the inductive step and proper syntax for case handling.\n\nImprovement: Complete the inductive step by providing the 'succ' case with a detailed proof, and ensure correct Lean 4 syntax for case handling in the induction tactic.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt has made progress by setting up the induction and proving the base case. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The induction syntax is incorrect. In Lean 4, we typically use `induction n with | zero => ... | succ n ih => ...` instead of separating cases with `with`.\n\n2. The inductive step is incomplete, marked with `sorry`. This needs to be fully implemented to complete the proof.\n\n3. The base case calculation is correct, but it could be simplified using `simp` tactics instead of explicit `calc` blocks.\n\n4. The `addAssoc` theorem is defined using `sorry`, which might cause issues when we need to use it in the proof.\n\nTo improve in the next iteration:\n\n1. Fix the induction syntax to follow Lean 4 conventions.\n2. Implement the inductive step, using the induction hypothesis (ih) and the definitions of `add` and `mul`.\n3. Use `simp` tactics where possible to simplify expressions.\n4. If `addAssoc` is needed, consider proving it first or using an alternative approach that doesn't rely on it.\n5. Ensure all cases are handled properly in the induction tactic.\n\nBy addressing these points, we should be able to make significant progress towards completing the proof of `mulAddDistrR`.",
