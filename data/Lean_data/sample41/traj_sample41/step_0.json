Inductive step:\n   - Expand the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize for the node case.\n   - Use the inductive hypotheses for the subtrees.\n   - Rearrange the terms to show equality.\n\n6. Use simplification and rewriting:\n   - Simplify expressions using the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize.\n   - Rewrite using the inductive hypotheses.\n\n7. Complete the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered.\n   - Verify that the sizes are equal for both the original and reversed trees.\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any simplifications or generalizations possible.\n   - Think about how this theorem might be useful for other proofs involving trees.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the reverseSize theorem using induction on the tree structure, leveraging the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove the theorem reverseSize, we should follow the induction approach outlined in the planning strategy. Since we're at the beginning of the proof, we should start by setting up the induction on the structure of the tree t.\n\nThe reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1. We need to use induction on the structure of the tree t. In Lean 4, this can be done using the `induction` tactic.\n\n2. The Tree type has two constructors: leaf and node. Therefore, our induction will have two cases to consider.\n\n3. For each case, we'll need to show that the size of the reversed tree equals the size of the original tree.\n\n4. The induction tactic will automatically generate the base case (leaf) and the inductive case (node) for us.\n\n5. After applying induction, we'll be able to work on each case separately.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start the proof by applying induction on t. This will set up the structure for the rest of the proof and allow us to tackle each case individually.\n",
    "reflection": "Based on the current observation, I can provide the following reflection:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt fails at the final step because the left-hand side (treeSize r + treeSize l) is not definitionally equal to the right-hand side (treeSize l + treeSize r).\n\nImprovement: We need to use the commutativity of addition to prove that treeSize r + treeSize l = treeSize l + treeSize r, instead of relying on reflexivity (rfl).\n```\n\nThe proof was mostly correct up until the final step. The induction was set up properly, the base case was handled correctly, and the inductive case was simplified and rewritten using the induction hypotheses. However, the final step failed because the order of addition matters in the expression, and Lean doesn't automatically recognize that addition is commutative.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should:\n\n1. Remove the final `rfl` tactic.\n2. Instead, use a tactic that applies the commutativity of addition. In Lean 4, we can use the `ring` tactic, which is capable of proving equalities in commutative rings (which includes integer addition).\n\nThe acting agent should replace the final `rfl` with `ring` to complete the proof. This will allow Lean to use the properties of integer addition to prove that treeSize r + treeSize l = treeSize l + treeSize r, thus completing the theorem.",
