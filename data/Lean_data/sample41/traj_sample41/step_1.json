    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem reverseSize:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of a reversed tree is equal to the size of the original tree.\n   - The theorem involves two functions: treeReverse and treeSize.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Use induction on the structure of the tree t.\n   - We'll need to consider two cases: leaf and node.\n\n3. Base case (leaf):\n   - Show that treeSize (treeReverse leaf) = treeSize leaf\n\n4. Inductive case (node):\n   - Assume the theorem holds for subtrees l and r.\n   - Prove the theorem for node l v r.\n\n5. Inductive step:\n   - Expand the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize for the node case.\n   - Use the inductive hypotheses for the subtrees.\n   - Rearrange the terms to show equality.\n\n6. Use simplification and rewriting:\n   - Simplify expressions using the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize.\n   - Rewrite using the inductive hypotheses.\n\n7. Complete the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered.\n   - Verify that the sizes are equal for both the original and reversed trees.\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any simplifications or generalizations possible.\n   - Think about how this theorem might be useful for other proofs involving trees.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the reverseSize theorem using induction on the tree structure, leveraging the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe proof is almost complete, but we've encountered an issue with the final step. The problem is that we're trying to prove that treeSize r + treeSize l = treeSize l + treeSize r using reflexivity (rfl), which doesn't work because these expressions are not definitionally equal.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to use a tactic that can handle the commutativity of addition. In Lean 4, the `ring` tactic is perfect for this situation. It can prove equalities in commutative rings, which includes integer addition.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to replace the final `rfl` tactic with `ring`. This will allow Lean to use the properties of integer addition to prove that treeSize r + treeSize l = treeSize l + treeSize r, thus completing the theorem.\n\nAfter making this change, the proof should be complete and the theorem should be proven successfully.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The 'ring' tactic is not recognized in Lean 4, causing the proof to fail at the final step.\n\nImprovement: Replace the 'ring' tactic with 'rw [add_comm]' to use the commutativity of addition explicitly, or use 'simp only [add_comm]' to simplify the equation.\n```\n\nThe reflection highlights that the main issue in the proof attempt was the use of the 'ring' tactic, which is not available in Lean 4. This led to an \"unknown tactic\" error and prevented the completion of the proof.\n\nTo improve the proof, we need to use tactics that are available in Lean 4 and can handle the commutativity of addition. The 'rw [add_comm]' tactic would rewrite the equation using the commutativity of addition, or 'simp only [add_comm]' would simplify the equation using the same property. Both of these approaches should work to prove that treeSize r + treeSize l = treeSize l + treeSize r.\n\nFor future proof attempts, it's important to be aware of the differences between Lean 3 and Lean 4 tactics and to use tactics that are specifically available in Lean 4. Additionally, when dealing with arithmetic properties like commutativity, it's often helpful to use explicit rewriting or simplification tactics rather than relying on more complex tactics that may not be available or may behave differently across different versions of Lean.",
