    "planning_context": "\nPlan for proving the theorem reverseSize:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - We need to prove that the size of a reversed tree is equal to the size of the original tree.\n   - The theorem involves two functions: treeReverse and treeSize.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Use induction on the structure of the tree t.\n   - We'll need to consider two cases: leaf and node.\n\n3. Base case (leaf):\n   - Show that treeSize (treeReverse leaf) = treeSize leaf\n\n4. Inductive case (node):\n   - Assume the theorem holds for subtrees l and r.\n   - Prove the theorem for node l v r.\n\n5. Inductive step:\n   - Expand the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize for the node case.\n   - Use the inductive hypotheses for the subtrees.\n   - Rearrange the terms to show equality.\n\n6. Use simplification and rewriting:\n   - Simplify expressions using the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize.\n   - Rewrite using the inductive hypotheses.\n\n7. Complete the proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered.\n   - Verify that the sizes are equal for both the original and reversed trees.\n\n8. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any simplifications or generalizations possible.\n   - Think about how this theorem might be useful for other proofs involving trees.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to prove the reverseSize theorem using induction on the tree structure, leveraging the definitions of treeReverse and treeSize.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. The main issue in the proof is the use of 'add_comm', which is not recognized in Lean 4. We need to use the correct theorem for addition commutativity.\n\n2. Given that we're dealing with tree sizes, it's likely that these sizes are represented as natural numbers (Nat) rather than integers (Int).\n\n3. In Lean 4, the commutativity of addition for natural numbers is typically represented by 'Nat.add_comm'.\n\n4. To fix the proof, we should replace 'rw [add_comm]' with 'rw [Nat.add_comm]'.\n\n5. If 'Nat.add_comm' is not directly accessible, we may need to open the Nat namespace or use the full path.\n\n6. In case the tree sizes are represented as Int, we should use 'Int.add_comm' instead.\n\n7. We should also check if any additional imports or declarations are needed to access these arithmetic properties.\n\n8. The rest of the proof structure looks correct, so this change should be sufficient to complete the proof.\n\nNext steps for the acting agent:\n1. Replace 'rw [add_comm]' with 'rw [Nat.add_comm]' in the last line of the proof.\n2. If this doesn't work immediately, try opening the Nat namespace at the beginning of the file with 'open Nat'.\n3. If the above steps don't resolve the issue, check if the tree size is defined using Int instead of Nat, and adjust accordingly by using 'Int.add_comm'.\n",
