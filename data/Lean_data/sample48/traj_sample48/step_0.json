    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem andIntro:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem is named 'andIntro'\n   - It involves two propositions A and B\n   - The goal is to prove: A → B → A ∧ B\n\n2. Understand the logical structure:\n   - This is an implication: we need to prove that if A is true and B is true, then A ∧ B is true\n   - The theorem uses currying, so we'll likely need to introduce two hypotheses\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start by introducing hypotheses for A and B\n   b. Use the 'and' introduction rule to combine A and B\n   c. Construct the final proof using the introduced hypotheses\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the 'and' introduction rule\n   - exact: to finish the proof if we have the exact term needed\n\n5. Potential proof structure:\n   - intro ha (introduce hypothesis for A)\n   - intro hb (introduce hypothesis for B)\n   - apply And.intro (apply the 'and' introduction rule)\n   - exact ha (provide proof for A)\n   - exact hb (provide proof for B)\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that the final proof term matches the goal type\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the andIntro theorem in Lean 4, focusing on the logical steps needed to construct the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof for the theorem andIntro (A B : Prop) : A → B → A ∧ B, our first step should be to introduce the hypotheses for A and B. This aligns with the planning strategy's first step in the proof outline.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The theorem statement shows that we have two implications (→) before reaching the conjunction (∧). This suggests we need to introduce two hypotheses.\n2. In Lean 4, we use the 'intro' tactic to introduce hypotheses from implications in the goal.\n3. We should introduce these hypotheses one at a time, giving them meaningful names to make the proof more readable.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the acting agent start by using the 'intro' tactic to introduce a hypothesis for A. This will transform the goal by removing the first implication and introduce a local hypothesis for A.\n\nThe next step after this would be to introduce a hypothesis for B, but we'll wait for the result of the first intro before proceeding to ensure we're on the right track.\n",
