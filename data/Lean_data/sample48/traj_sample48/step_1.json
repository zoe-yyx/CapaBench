    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem andIntro:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem is named 'andIntro'\n   - It involves two propositions A and B\n   - The goal is to prove: A → B → A ∧ B\n\n2. Understand the logical structure:\n   - This is an implication: we need to prove that if A is true and B is true, then A ∧ B is true\n   - The theorem uses currying, so we'll likely need to introduce two hypotheses\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start by introducing hypotheses for A and B\n   b. Use the 'and' introduction rule to combine A and B\n   c. Construct the final proof using the introduced hypotheses\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the 'and' introduction rule\n   - exact: to finish the proof if we have the exact term needed\n\n5. Potential proof structure:\n   - intro ha (introduce hypothesis for A)\n   - intro hb (introduce hypothesis for B)\n   - apply And.intro (apply the 'and' introduction rule)\n   - exact ha (provide proof for A)\n   - exact hb (provide proof for B)\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that the final proof term matches the goal type\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the andIntro theorem in Lean 4, focusing on the logical steps needed to construct the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current state shows that we have successfully introduced the hypothesis 'ha' for proposition A. The goal has been updated to prove 'B → A ∧ B' under the context where we have 'ha : A'.\n\nFollowing our plan, the next logical step is to introduce a hypothesis for B. This aligns with step 3a in our outline, where we planned to introduce hypotheses for both A and B.\n\nBy introducing a hypothesis for B, we'll be in a position to apply the 'and' introduction rule, which requires proofs of both A and B to construct A ∧ B.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should use the 'intro' tactic again to introduce a hypothesis for B. This will further simplify our goal and set us up for the final steps of the proof.\n",
