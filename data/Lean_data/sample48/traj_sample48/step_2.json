    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem andIntro:\n\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem is named 'andIntro'\n   - It involves two propositions A and B\n   - The goal is to prove: A → B → A ∧ B\n\n2. Understand the logical structure:\n   - This is an implication: we need to prove that if A is true and B is true, then A ∧ B is true\n   - The theorem uses currying, so we'll likely need to introduce two hypotheses\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start by introducing hypotheses for A and B\n   b. Use the 'and' introduction rule to combine A and B\n   c. Construct the final proof using the introduced hypotheses\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce hypotheses\n   - apply: to apply the 'and' introduction rule\n   - exact: to finish the proof if we have the exact term needed\n\n5. Potential proof structure:\n   - intro ha (introduce hypothesis for A)\n   - intro hb (introduce hypothesis for B)\n   - apply And.intro (apply the 'and' introduction rule)\n   - exact ha (provide proof for A)\n   - exact hb (provide proof for B)\n\n6. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Check that the final proof term matches the goal type\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the andIntro theorem in Lean 4, focusing on the logical steps needed to construct the proof.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and the planning strategy, we can reason about the next step as follows:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypotheses for both A and B using the 'intro' tactic, as planned. This aligns with steps 3a and 4 of our plan.\n\n2. The current goal state shows:\n   A B : Prop\n   ha : A\n   hb : B\n   ⊢ A ∧ B\n\n3. This matches exactly with what we expected after introducing the hypotheses. We now need to prove A ∧ B given that we have ha : A and hb : B.\n\n4. The next logical step, as outlined in our plan (step 3b and 4), is to apply the 'and' introduction rule. In Lean 4, this can be done using the 'apply' tactic with And.intro.\n\n5. After applying And.intro, we expect to have two subgoals: one for proving A and another for proving B. These should be easily solved using our hypotheses ha and hb.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to apply the And.intro rule, which will set us up for the final steps of our proof. This aligns perfectly with our original plan and the current state of the proof.\n",
