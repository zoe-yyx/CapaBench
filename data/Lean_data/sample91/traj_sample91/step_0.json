Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if P1 is equivalent to P2, and Q1 is equivalent to Q2, then (P1 implies Q1) is equivalent to (P2 implies Q2).\n\n2. Break down the goal:\n   - We need to prove a bi-implication (↔), so we'll need to prove both directions.\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Introduce the hypotheses:\n      - (P1 ↔ P2)\n      - (Q1 ↔ Q2)\n   b. Prove (P1 → Q1) → (P2 → Q2)\n   c. Prove (P2 → Q2) → (P1 → Q1)\n\n4. For each direction of the proof:\n   a. Assume the antecedent\n   b. Assume the hypothesis of the implication\n   c. Use the equivalences from the hypotheses to transform the problem\n   d. Derive the conclusion\n\n5. Key strategies to employ:\n   - Use intro and apply tactics for implications\n   - Use iff.mp and iff.mpr to extract directions from bi-implications\n   - Use transitivity of implications where necessary\n\n6. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure that both directions are proved\n   - Verify that all hypotheses are used\n   - Check that the proof follows logically and uses appropriate Lean 4 tactics\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the implyCongr theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and highlighting key strategies to use in the Lean 4 proof assistant.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem implyCongr, we should follow the structure outlined in the planning strategy. Let's start by introducing the hypotheses and setting up the proof structure:\n\n1. Introduce the hypotheses:\n   We need to introduce two hypotheses for the bi-implications (P1 ↔ P2) and (Q1 ↔ Q2).\n\n2. Set up the proof structure:\n   Since we're proving a bi-implication ((P1 → Q1) ↔ (P2 → Q2)), we need to prove both directions. We can use the `constructor` tactic to split our goal into two implications.\n\n3. Focus on the first direction:\n   We'll start by proving (P1 → Q1) → (P2 → Q2). This will involve:\n   a. Introducing the assumption (P1 → Q1)\n   b. Introducing P2 as a hypothesis\n   c. Using the given equivalences to transform P2 to P1, then apply (P1 → Q1)\n   d. Transform the resulting Q1 back to Q2\n\nThe acting agent should start by introducing the hypotheses and using the `constructor` tactic to set up the proof structure. Then, they should focus on proving the first direction of the bi-implication.\n",
