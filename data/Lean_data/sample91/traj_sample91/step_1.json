    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem implyCongr:\n\n1. Understand the theorem:\n   - The theorem states that if P1 is equivalent to P2, and Q1 is equivalent to Q2, then (P1 implies Q1) is equivalent to (P2 implies Q2).\n\n2. Break down the goal:\n   - We need to prove a bi-implication (↔), so we'll need to prove both directions.\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Introduce the hypotheses:\n      - (P1 ↔ P2)\n      - (Q1 ↔ Q2)\n   b. Prove (P1 → Q1) → (P2 → Q2)\n   c. Prove (P2 → Q2) → (P1 → Q1)\n\n4. For each direction of the proof:\n   a. Assume the antecedent\n   b. Assume the hypothesis of the implication\n   c. Use the equivalences from the hypotheses to transform the problem\n   d. Derive the conclusion\n\n5. Key strategies to employ:\n   - Use intro and apply tactics for implications\n   - Use iff.mp and iff.mpr to extract directions from bi-implications\n   - Use transitivity of implications where necessary\n\n6. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure that both directions are proved\n   - Verify that all hypotheses are used\n   - Check that the proof follows logically and uses appropriate Lean 4 tactics\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the implyCongr theorem, breaking it down into manageable steps and highlighting key strategies to use in the Lean 4 proof assistant.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof, we have successfully proven the first direction (mp) of the bi-implication. Now we need to focus on proving the second direction (mpr).\n\nFor the mpr case, we need to prove: (P2 → Q2) → P1 → Q1\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. We should start by introducing the hypotheses for this direction. We'll assume (P2 → Q2) and then P1.\n\n2. Our goal will then be to prove Q1.\n\n3. To prove Q1, we can use the following chain of reasoning:\n   - We have P1, and we know P1 ↔ P2 (from h1), so we can deduce P2.\n   - We can then apply (P2 → Q2) to get Q2.\n   - Finally, we can use Q1 ↔ Q2 (from h2) to conclude Q1.\n\n4. In Lean 4 terms, this translates to:\n   - Use 'intro' to assume (P2 → Q2) and P1\n   - Apply h2.mpr to change the goal from Q1 to Q2\n   - Apply the assumed (P2 → Q2)\n   - Use h1.mp to prove P2 from P1\n\nThis reasoning should guide the acting agent to complete the proof by proving the second direction of the bi-implication.\n",
