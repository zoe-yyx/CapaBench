    "reasoning": "\n1. The initial step of unfolding definitions using 'rw [shift_up1, plus_one]' was correct and should be kept.\n\n2. The 'simp' tactic didn't make any progress, so we should skip it in the next attempt.\n\n3. After unfolding the definitions, we have the goal: x + 1 + 1 = x + 2\n\n4. To prove this, we need to focus on the left-hand side of the equation:\n   a) First, we should use the associativity of addition to regroup the terms.\n   b) Then, we can simplify the regrouped expression.\n\n5. The 'rw [add_assoc]' step was correct and should be kept, as it applies the associativity of addition.\n\n6. After regrouping, we can use 'norm_num' to normalize and simplify the numerical expressions.\n\n7. If 'norm_num' doesn't complete the proof, we might need to consider using 'rfl' to prove reflexivity, or 'linarith' as a last resort for linear integer arithmetic.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the next steps in the proof should be:\n\n1. rw [shift_up1, plus_one]\n2. rw [add_assoc]\n3. norm_num\n\nIf these steps don't complete the proof, consider adding 'rfl' at the end. If that still doesn't work, try using 'linarith' as the final step.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof was completed successfully with 'norm_num', but the unnecessary 'rfl' tactic caused an error as there were no remaining goals.\n\nImprovement: Remove the 'rfl' tactic at the end of the proof, as 'norm_num' is sufficient to complete the theorem.\n```\n\nThe current proof strategy was largely successful, as it managed to prove the theorem. The steps of unfolding definitions, applying associativity, and using 'norm_num' were all correct and effective. The only issue was the inclusion of an unnecessary 'rfl' tactic at the end.\n\nFor future proofs:\n\n1. Always check if the proof is completed after each tactic. In this case, 'norm_num' was sufficient to finish the proof.\n\n2. Be cautious about adding extra tactics after 'norm_num' or other powerful simplification tactics, as they might have already solved the goal.\n\n3. If you're unsure whether a proof is complete, you can use the 'done' tactic instead of 'rfl'. The 'done' tactic will succeed if there are no more goals and fail otherwise, providing a safe way to check if the proof is complete.\n\n4. Remember that for simple arithmetic equalities like this one, 'norm_num' is often powerful enough to complete the proof on its own.\n\nIn the next iteration, we should keep the successful parts of the proof and simply remove the unnecessary 'rfl' at the end. This will result in a clean, efficient proof of the theorem.",
