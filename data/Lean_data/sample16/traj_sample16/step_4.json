Simplification strategy:\n   - Unfold the definition of `shift_up1` with `plus_one` as its argument\n   - Simplify the resulting expression step by step\n\n4. Arithmetic manipulation:\n   - Use integer addition properties to rearrange terms\n   - Aim to show that the result equals `x + 2`\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Verify that the final expression matches the right-hand side of the theorem statement\n\n6. Proof structure:\n   - Begin with `rw [shift_up1, plus_one]` to unfold definitions\n   - Use `simp` or manual simplification steps\n   - If needed, use `ring` tactic for arithmetic simplification\n   - Conclude with `rfl` if the equality is reflexive after simplification\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof strategy is correct and nearly complete. We have successfully unfolded the definitions, applied associativity, and used 'norm_num' to simplify the arithmetic. The only issue is the unnecessary 'rfl' tactic at the end, which caused an error because there were no remaining goals after 'norm_num'.\n\nTo fix this, we should keep the existing proof steps but remove the 'rfl' tactic. The 'norm_num' tactic is powerful enough to complete the proof for this simple arithmetic equality.\n\nThe revised proof structure should be:\n\n1. Use 'rw [shift_up1, plus_one]' to unfold the definitions.\n2. Apply 'rw [add_assoc]' to rearrange the terms using associativity.\n3. Finally, use 'norm_num' to simplify and complete the proof.\n\nThis approach will provide a clean, efficient proof of the theorem without any unnecessary steps.\n",
