    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof, our first step should be to unfold the definitions of `shift_up1` and `plus_one` as outlined in the planning strategy. This will allow us to see the concrete expressions we're working with.\n\nThe acting agent should start by using the `rw` (rewrite) tactic to expand these definitions. Specifically, they should use:\n\nrw [shift_up1, plus_one]\n\nThis will replace `shift_up1 plus_one x` with its definition, and then replace `plus_one` within that expression with its definition.\n\nAfter this step, we expect to see an expression that looks like:\n\n(x + 1) + 1\n\nThis expanded form will make it clear how we can proceed to show that it equals `x + 2`.\n\nThe next step after this rewrite would likely be to use the `simp` tactic or to manually simplify the expression using arithmetic properties. However, let's first see the result of the initial `rw` step before deciding on the next move.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt failed because the 'simp' tactic was unable to automatically simplify the expression 'x + 1 + 1' to 'x + 2'.\n\nImprovement: We should use explicit arithmetic reasoning tactics like 'ring' or 'linarith' instead of 'simp' to handle the integer arithmetic in this proof.\n```\n\nThe current approach successfully unfolded the definitions using 'rw [shift_up1, plus_one]', which transformed the goal into 'x + 1 + 1 = x + 2'. However, the subsequent 'simp' tactic failed to make progress on this equality.\n\nTo improve our approach, we should recognize that this is a simple arithmetic equality that requires explicit handling. The 'ring' tactic is particularly well-suited for such algebraic simplifications, or 'linarith' could be used as it's good at handling linear integer arithmetic.\n\nFor the next step, I suggest replacing 'simp' with 'ring' or 'linarith'. This should complete the proof by directly showing that 'x + 1 + 1' is indeed equal to 'x + 2'.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that we didn't need to use 'sorry' in this proof attempt, which is good practice. We should continue to avoid using 'sorry' and instead focus on completing the proof rigorously using appropriate tactics.",
