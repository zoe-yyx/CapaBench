    "reasoning": "\nThe proof has successfully unfolded the definitions of `shift_up1` and `plus_one` using the `rw` tactic, which transformed our goal into the arithmetic equality `x + 1 + 1 = x + 2`. However, the `simp` tactic was unable to automatically simplify this expression.\n\nGiven that we are dealing with a straightforward arithmetic equality involving integers, we should use a tactic specifically designed for such situations. The `ring` tactic is an excellent choice for simplifying algebraic expressions and proving such equalities.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to apply the `ring` tactic. This tactic is powerful enough to recognize that `x + 1 + 1` is indeed equal to `x + 2` for all integers `x`, and it should be able to complete the proof in one step.\n\nIf for any reason `ring` doesn't work as expected, an alternative would be to use the `linarith` tactic, which is particularly good at handling linear integer arithmetic.\n\nAfter applying `ring` (or `linarith` if needed), the proof should be complete, and no further steps should be necessary.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The 'ring' tactic is not available in Lean 4, causing the proof to fail.\nImprovement: Replace 'ring' with 'simp' or a combination of 'rw' and 'norm_num' to simplify the arithmetic expression.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt failed because it used the 'ring' tactic, which is not available in Lean 4. This is a common mistake when transitioning from Lean 3 to Lean 4, as many tactics have changed or been replaced.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should use tactics that are available and suitable for arithmetic simplification in Lean 4. The 'simp' tactic might be sufficient to simplify the expression `x + 1 + 1 = x + 2`. If 'simp' alone doesn't work, we can use a combination of 'rw' to rewrite the left-hand side and 'norm_num' to normalize the numerical expressions.\n\nFor future actions, we should:\n1. Replace 'ring' with 'simp' as the first attempt.\n2. If 'simp' doesn't fully solve the goal, try using 'rw [add_assoc]' followed by 'norm_num'.\n3. Always verify that the tactics we're using are available and behave as expected in Lean 4.\n4. Consider using the 'linarith' tactic as a last resort for integer arithmetic problems, as it was imported at the beginning of the file.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to complete the proof successfully in the next attempt.",
