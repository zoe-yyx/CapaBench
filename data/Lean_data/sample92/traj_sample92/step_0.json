    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem andImply:\n\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem involves a bi-implication (↔) between two implications.\n   - Left side: (P ∧ Q → R)\n   - Right side: (P → Q → R)\n\n2. Plan to prove both directions of the bi-implication:\n   a. (P ∧ Q → R) → (P → Q → R)\n   b. (P → Q → R) → (P ∧ Q → R)\n\n3. For direction (a):\n   - Assume (P ∧ Q → R) as a hypothesis\n   - Introduce P and Q as separate assumptions\n   - Show that R follows from these assumptions\n\n4. For direction (b):\n   - Assume (P → Q → R) as a hypothesis\n   - Introduce (P ∧ Q) as an assumption\n   - Break down the conjunction into its components\n   - Apply the hypothesis to derive R\n\n5. Use Lean 4 tactics:\n   - intro for introducing hypotheses and assumptions\n   - apply for applying hypotheses or known facts\n   - exact for proving goals directly\n   - constructor for proving bi-implications\n\n6. Consider using auxiliary lemmas if needed:\n   - and.left and and.right for extracting components from a conjunction\n   - and.intro for constructing a conjunction\n\n7. Reflect on the logical equivalence between the two forms:\n   - (P ∧ Q → R) represents a single implication from a conjunction\n   - (P → Q → R) represents nested implications\n\n8. Be prepared to use propositional logic rules and Lean 4's built-in tactics to manipulate the propositions as needed.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the bi-implication, considering both directions and the logical relationships between the propositions involved.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem andImply, we should follow the plan's structure of proving both directions of the bi-implication. Let's start with setting up the proof structure:\n\n1. Use the `constructor` tactic to split the bi-implication (↔) into two implications (→). This will create two subgoals, one for each direction of the proof.\n\n2. For the first subgoal (P ∧ Q → R) → (P → Q → R):\n   - Use `intro h` to introduce the hypothesis (P ∧ Q → R).\n   - Then use `intro hP` and `intro hQ` to introduce assumptions for P and Q respectively.\n   - This will set up the left-hand side of the implication and prepare us to prove R.\n\n3. For the second subgoal (P → Q → R) → (P ∧ Q → R):\n   - We'll handle this after completing the first direction.\n\nBy starting with these steps, we'll establish a clear structure for our proof and be ready to work on each direction of the bi-implication separately. This approach aligns with the planning strategy and sets us up for a systematic proof process.\n",
