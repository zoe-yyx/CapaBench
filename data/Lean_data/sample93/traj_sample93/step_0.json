    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we are at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, we should start by implementing the first steps of our plan:\n\n1. Use the `iff` tactic to split the bi-implication into two implications. This will create two separate goals, one for each direction of the proof.\n\n2. For the left-to-right direction (→), we should:\n   a. Use the `intro` tactic to assume the left side of the bi-implication: (P ∨ Q → R)\n   b. Use the `and.intro` tactic to split the right side goal into two subgoals: (P → R) and (Q → R)\n\n3. After splitting the goal, we'll focus on proving the first subgoal (P → R):\n   a. Use the `intro` tactic again to assume P\n   b. Our goal will then be to prove R\n\n4. To prove R, we can use the assumption (P ∨ Q → R) that we introduced earlier:\n   a. Apply this implication using the `apply` tactic\n   b. This will change our goal to proving (P ∨ Q)\n   c. Use the `left` tactic to prove (P ∨ Q) using the P we assumed\n\nThis reasoning covers the initial steps of the proof and sets up the structure for the left-to-right direction. The acting agent should follow these steps to begin the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof attempt used tactics that are not recognized in Lean 4, specifically the 'iff' tactic.\n\nImprovement: We need to adjust our approach to use Lean 4 compatible tactics, such as 'constructor' for bi-implications and 'fun' for introducing functions, while maintaining the logical structure of the proof.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is that the proof attempt used tactics that are not compatible with Lean 4. In Lean 4, the syntax and tactics have changed from Lean 3, and we need to adapt our proof accordingly.\n\nTo improve our next steps, we should:\n\n1. Replace 'iff' with 'constructor' to split the bi-implication into two directions.\n2. Use 'fun' instead of 'intro' for introducing functions.\n3. Replace 'apply And.intro' with 'constructor' for proving conjunctions.\n4. Use 'fun' and pattern matching instead of 'cases' for case analysis on disjunctions.\n5. Utilize Lean 4's more powerful automation where possible, such as with the 'simp' tactic.\n\nIn the next iteration, we should focus on translating the logical structure of our proof into Lean 4 compatible syntax. This will involve rewriting our proof steps using the correct Lean 4 tactics and constructs, while maintaining the same logical flow of the argument.",
