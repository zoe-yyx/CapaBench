Plan the proof structure:\n   - Use the iff tactic to split the bi-implication into two implications\n   - Prove each direction separately\n\n3. Left-to-right direction (→):\n   - Assume the left side: (P ∨ Q → R)\n   - Prove the right side: (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n   - Use the and.intro tactic to split the goal into two subgoals\n   - For each subgoal, use the intro tactic to assume the antecedent\n   - Use the or.elim tactic to consider cases for P ∨ Q\n\n4. Right-to-left direction (←):\n   - Assume the right side: (P → R) ∧ (Q → R)\n   - Prove the left side: (P ∨ Q → R)\n   - Use the intro tactic to assume P ∨ Q\n   - Use the or.elim tactic to consider cases for P and Q\n   - Apply the corresponding implication from the assumption to prove R in each case\n\n5.

    "reasoning": "\nLet's start by restructuring our proof using Lean 4 compatible tactics and syntax:\n\n1. Use 'constructor' to split the bi-implication into two directions.\n2. For the forward direction (→):\n   - Use 'fun h => constructor' to introduce the assumption and split the conjunction.\n   - For each part of the conjunction, use nested 'fun' to introduce the assumptions.\n   - Apply the original hypothesis 'h' to prove each case, using 'Or.inl' and 'Or.inr' as before.\n3. For the backward direction (←):\n   - Use 'fun h pq => match pq with' to introduce the assumptions and pattern match on the disjunction.\n   - Use '| Or.inl p => h.left p' and '| Or.inr q => h.right q' to handle each case.\n\nThis structure will maintain the logical flow of our original proof while using Lean 4 compatible syntax. The acting agent should implement this structure, starting with the 'constructor' tactic to split the bi-implication.\n",
