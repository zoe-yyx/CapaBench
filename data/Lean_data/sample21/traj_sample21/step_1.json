    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove that addition (+) is associative for integers.\n   - The theorem name is 'plus_assoc'.\n   - We're using the 'assoc' definition, which defines associativity for a function f.\n\n2. Understand the 'assoc' definition:\n   - 'assoc' takes a function f : ℤ → ℤ → ℤ as an argument.\n   - It states that for all x, y, z: f x (f y z) = f (f x y) z\n\n3. Plan the proof structure:\n   a. Unfold the definition of 'assoc'.\n   b. Introduce arbitrary integers x, y, and z.\n   c. Show that (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) for these arbitrary integers.\n\n4. Proof steps:\n   a. Use 'intro' or 'fun' to introduce x, y, and z.\n   b. Rewrite the goal to match the form of the 'assoc' definition.\n   c. Use ring theory tactics to prove the equality.\n\n5. Key tactics to consider:\n   - 'rfl' or 'ring' for simplifying and proving ring equalities.\n   - 'simp' for potential simplification of expressions.\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - This proof should be relatively straightforward, as associativity of addition for integers is a fundamental property.\n   - The 'Ring' import suggests that ring theory tactics will be useful.\n\n7. Possible extensions:\n   - If successful, consider proving associativity for other operations like multiplication.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt is incorrect due to the improper use of 'fun' directly in the theorem body. To fix this and prove the associativity of addition for integers, we need to restructure the proof as follows:\n\n1. Start by unfolding the definition of 'assoc' using the 'unfold assoc' tactic. This will expose the universal quantifiers and the equality we need to prove.\n\n2. After unfolding, introduce the variables x, y, and z using the 'intros' tactic. This will bring these variables into the local context.\n\n3. The goal should now be in the form of an equality: (x + y) + z = x + (y + z).\n\n4. At this point, we can use the 'ring' tactic to prove the equality. The 'ring' tactic is powerful for proving equalities in ring-like structures, which includes integer addition.\n\nThis approach follows the standard structure for proofs in Lean 4 and should resolve the current errors while successfully proving the theorem.\n\nThe acting agent should implement these steps in order, starting with 'unfold assoc' and ending with the 'ring' tactic. This structured approach will provide a clear and correct proof of the associativity of addition for integers.\n",
