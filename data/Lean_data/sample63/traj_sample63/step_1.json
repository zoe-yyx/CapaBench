    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem is named 'notEx1'\n   - It involves two integer variables 'n' and 'm'\n   - The goal is to prove: n < m ∨ ¬(n < m)\n   - This is a classic example of the law of excluded middle\n\n2. Identify the key strategy:\n   - Since we're using Classical logic (as indicated by 'open Classical'), we can use the law of excluded middle\n   - The law of excluded middle states that for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation (¬P) is true\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the 'em' tactic (em stands for \"excluded middle\")\n   b. This will create two cases: n < m and ¬(n < m)\n   c. For each case, we'll need to prove that it implies our goal\n\n4. Plan for each case:\n   - Case 1 (n < m):\n     * This directly proves the left side of our disjunction\n     * Use the 'left' tactic to choose the left side of the disjunction\n   - Case 2 (¬(n < m)):\n     * This directly proves the right side of our disjunction\n     * Use the 'right' tactic to choose the right side of the disjunction\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - After handling both cases, the proof should be complete\n   - No additional steps should be necessary\n\n6. Tactics to use:\n   - em (excluded middle)\n   - cases (to handle the two cases created by em)\n   - left (to prove the left side of a disjunction)\n   - right (to prove the right side of a disjunction)\n   - assumption (to use a hypothesis that directly proves our goal)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo address the error and proceed with the proof in Lean 4, we should replace the 'em' tactic with the appropriate Lean 4 syntax for applying the law of excluded middle. The 'by_cases' tactic is a suitable replacement that will allow us to create the two cases we need for our proof.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Use 'by_cases h : n < m' to split the proof into two cases based on whether n < m is true or false.\n2. For the positive case (h : n < m), we'll use 'left' to choose the left side of the disjunction and then use 'exact h' to prove it.\n3. For the negative case (h : ¬(n < m)), we'll use 'right' to choose the right side of the disjunction and then use 'exact h' to prove it.\n\nThis approach maintains the structure of our original proof attempt but uses Lean 4 compatible syntax. It directly addresses the error we encountered and should allow us to complete the proof successfully.\n",
