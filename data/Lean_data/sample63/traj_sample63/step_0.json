    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - The theorem is named 'notEx1'\n   - It involves two integer variables 'n' and 'm'\n   - The goal is to prove: n < m ∨ ¬(n < m)\n   - This is a classic example of the law of excluded middle\n\n2. Identify the key strategy:\n   - Since we're using Classical logic (as indicated by 'open Classical'), we can use the law of excluded middle\n   - The law of excluded middle states that for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation (¬P) is true\n\n3. Outline the proof steps:\n   a. Start with the 'em' tactic (em stands for \"excluded middle\")\n   b. This will create two cases: n < m and ¬(n < m)\n   c. For each case, we'll need to prove that it implies our goal\n\n4. Plan for each case:\n   - Case 1 (n < m):\n     * This directly proves the left side of our disjunction\n     * Use the 'left' tactic to choose the left side of the disjunction\n   - Case 2 (¬(n < m)):\n     * This directly proves the right side of our disjunction\n     * Use the 'right' tactic to choose the right side of the disjunction\n\n5. Conclude the proof:\n   - After handling both cases, the proof should be complete\n   - No additional steps should be necessary\n\n6. Tactics to use:\n   - em (excluded middle)\n   - cases (to handle the two cases created by em)\n   - left (to prove the left side of a disjunction)\n   - right (to prove the right side of a disjunction)\n   - assumption (to use a hypothesis that directly proves our goal)\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof and following our planned strategy, the first step should be to apply the law of excluded middle. This is a fundamental principle in classical logic that states for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation (¬P) is true.\n\nIn our case, the proposition we want to apply this to is \"n < m\". By applying the law of excluded middle, we'll create two cases that cover all possibilities: either n < m is true, or it's not true (¬(n < m)).\n\nThe 'em' tactic in Lean 4 is specifically designed for this purpose. It will split our proof into these two cases, allowing us to prove each separately and thus prove our theorem.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step in our proof should be to use the 'em' tactic with the proposition \"n < m\". This will set up the structure for the rest of our proof, allowing us to handle each case individually in the subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The 'em' tactic is not recognized in Lean 4, causing an error in the proof process.\nImprovement: Replace the 'em' tactic with the correct Lean 4 syntax for applying the law of excluded middle, such as using 'by_cases' or 'Classical.byCases'.\n```\n\nThe main issue here is that we've attempted to use the 'em' tactic, which is not available or recognized in Lean 4. This is likely because 'em' is a Lean 3 tactic, and we're working in Lean 4. \n\nTo improve our approach, we need to use the correct Lean 4 syntax for applying the law of excluded middle. In Lean 4, we can use 'by_cases' or 'Classical.byCases' to achieve the same effect as the 'em' tactic in Lean 3.\n\nFor the next steps, we should:\n\n1. Replace 'em (n < m)' with 'by_cases h : n < m' or 'Classical.byCases (fun h => n < m)'.\n2. Adjust the subsequent case analysis to match the new syntax.\n3. Ensure that we're using other Lean 4 specific tactics and syntax throughout the proof.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to correctly apply the law of excluded middle and proceed with the proof in a way that's compatible with Lean 4's syntax and tactics.",
