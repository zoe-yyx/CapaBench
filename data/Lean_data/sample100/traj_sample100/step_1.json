    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for addAssoc Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove the associativity of the 'add' function for natural numbers.\n   - The theorem states: add n (add m p) = add (add n m) p, for any natural numbers n, m, and p.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Method:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the 'add' function, induction on 'n' is likely the best approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Structure:\n   a. Base case: Prove the theorem holds when n = 0\n   b. Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for some k, then prove it holds for k+1 (succ k)\n\n4. Plan for the Base Case:\n   - Simplify add 0 (add m p) and add (add 0 m) p using the definition of 'add'\n   - Show that both expressions reduce to the same result\n\n5. Plan for the Inductive Step:\n   - Start with add (succ k) (add m p)\n   - Use the definition of 'add' for the succ case\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis\n   - Manipulate the expression to match add (add (succ k) m) p\n\n6. Utilize Lean 4 Tactics:\n   - Use 'induction n' to set up the proof structure\n   - Apply 'rfl' (reflexivity) for simple equalities\n   - Use 'simp' to simplify expressions where possible\n   - Apply 'rw' (rewrite) with the induction hypothesis and definition of 'add'\n\n7. Finalize the Proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Verify that the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of addition for natural numbers in Lean 4, focusing on induction as the main proof technique.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nFor the base case (n = 0):\n1. We need to prove: add 0 (add m p) = add (add 0 m) p\n2. Let's simplify the left side:\n   - By definition of add, add 0 (add m p) = add m p\n3. Now, let's simplify the right side:\n   - First, add 0 m = m (by definition of add)\n   - Then, add (add 0 m) p = add m p\n4. We can see that both sides simplify to add m p\n5. Therefore, we can prove this case using reflexivity (rfl)\n\nFor the inductive step:\n1. We need to prove: add (succ n') (add m p) = add (add (succ n') m) p\n2. Let's expand the left side using the definition of add:\n   - add (succ n') (add m p) = succ (add n' (add m p))\n3. Now, let's use the induction hypothesis (ih) to rewrite add n' (add m p):\n   - succ (add n' (add m p)) = succ (add (add n' m) p)\n4. For the right side, let's expand add (succ n') m:\n   - add (add (succ n') m) p = add (succ (add n' m)) p\n5. By definition of add, this is equal to:\n   - succ (add (add n' m) p)\n6. We can see that both sides are now equal\n\nTo implement this reasoning, the acting agent should:\n1. For the base case:\n   - Use 'rfl' to prove the equality after simplification\n2. For the inductive step:\n   - Use 'rw' to apply the definition of add and the induction hypothesis\n   - Use 'simp' or 'rfl' to complete the proof\n\nThis approach should allow us to complete the proof without using 'sorry'.\n",
