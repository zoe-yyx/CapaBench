    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for addAssoc Theorem:\n\n1. Understand the Problem:\n   - We need to prove the associativity of the 'add' function for natural numbers.\n   - The theorem states: add n (add m p) = add (add n m) p, for any natural numbers n, m, and p.\n\n2. Identify the Proof Method:\n   - Given the recursive nature of the 'add' function, induction on 'n' is likely the best approach.\n\n3. Outline the Proof Structure:\n   a. Base case: Prove the theorem holds when n = 0\n   b. Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for some k, then prove it holds for k+1 (succ k)\n\n4. Plan for the Base Case:\n   - Simplify add 0 (add m p) and add (add 0 m) p using the definition of 'add'\n   - Show that both expressions reduce to the same result\n\n5. Plan for the Inductive Step:\n   - Start with add (succ k) (add m p)\n   - Use the definition of 'add' for the succ case\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis\n   - Manipulate the expression to match add (add (succ k) m) p\n\n6. Utilize Lean 4 Tactics:\n   - Use 'induction n' to set up the proof structure\n   - Apply 'rfl' (reflexivity) for simple equalities\n   - Use 'simp' to simplify expressions where possible\n   - Apply 'rw' (rewrite) with the induction hypothesis and definition of 'add'\n\n7. Finalize the Proof:\n   - Ensure all cases are covered\n   - Check that each step logically follows from the previous one\n   - Verify that the final statement matches the theorem to be proved\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to proving the associativity of addition for natural numbers in Lean 4, focusing on induction as the main proof technique.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof and no actions have been taken yet, our first step should be to set up the induction on 'n' as outlined in the planning strategy. This will establish the structure for both the base case and the inductive step.\n\nThe reasoning for this initial step is as follows:\n\n1. The 'add' function is defined recursively on its first argument, which in our theorem is 'n'.\n2. The theorem needs to be proved for all natural numbers, which makes induction on 'n' a natural choice.\n3. Using induction will allow us to prove the base case (n = 0) and the inductive step (n = succ k) separately, following our proof plan.\n\nTherefore, the next operation should be to apply induction on 'n'. This will generate two goals:\n- The base case where n = 0\n- The inductive step where we assume the theorem holds for some k and prove it for succ k\n\nAfter setting up the induction, we'll be ready to tackle each case separately, starting with the base case as outlined in the plan.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current state of the proof:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof structure is correct, but both the base case and inductive step are left unproven using 'sorry'.\n\nImprovement: For the base case, we should simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of 'add', and for the inductive step, we should use the induction hypothesis and the definition of 'add' to prove the equality.\n```\n\nThe current proof structure using induction on 'n' is correct and aligns with our initial plan. However, the use of 'sorry' in both the base case and inductive step indicates that these crucial parts of the proof are incomplete.\n\nFor the base case (n = 0), we need to:\n1. Simplify 'add 0 (add m p)' using the definition of 'add'.\n2. Simplify 'add (add 0 m) p' using the definition of 'add'.\n3. Show that these simplified expressions are equal.\n\nFor the inductive step, we should:\n1. Use the definition of 'add' for the successor case to expand both sides of the equation.\n2. Apply the induction hypothesis (ih) to part of the expanded equation.\n3. Show that the resulting expressions are equal.\n\nIn both cases, we should use Lean 4 tactics to manipulate and simplify the expressions, such as 'rw' (rewrite), 'simp' (simplify), or 'calc' (for step-by-step equation solving).\n\nFor future actions, we should focus on completing these steps without using 'sorry', ensuring a rigorous and complete proof of the theorem.",
