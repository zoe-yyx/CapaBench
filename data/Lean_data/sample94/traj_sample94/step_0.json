    "reasoning": "\nTo prove that 6 is not prime, we need to find a factor of 6 between 2 and 5 (inclusive). The planning strategy suggests using 3 as our witness. Let's start by introducing this witness and then prove the three required conditions.\n\n1. Use the `use` tactic to introduce 3 as our witness for n.\n2. After introducing 3, we'll need to prove three conditions:\n   a. 2 ≤ 3\n   b. 3 < 6\n   c. ∃ q : ℤ, 3 * q = 6\n\n3. For the first two conditions (2 ≤ 3 and 3 < 6), we can use the `norm_num` tactic to automatically prove these simple arithmetic facts.\n\n4. For the third condition (∃ q : ℤ, 3 * q = 6), we need to introduce another witness. We'll use 2 for q, as 3 * 2 = 6.\n\n5. After introducing 2 as the witness for q, we can use `norm_num` again to prove that 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to construct a complete proof of the theorem. The acting agent should start by using the `use` tactic to introduce 3 as the witness for n.\n",
