    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove that a constant function is monotonic.\n   - The theorem name is 'const_mono' with parameter 'a : ℤ'.\n   - The 'mono' definition is given, which defines monotonicity for integer functions.\n\n2. Understand the goal:\n   - We need to show that for any constant function f(x) = a, where a is an integer,\n     the function satisfies the monotonicity property.\n\n3. Outline the proof structure:\n   - Begin by introducing the variables n and m, and the hypothesis n ≤ m.\n   - Show that f n ≤ f m for the constant function f(x) = a.\n\n4. Key steps in the proof:\n   - Expand the definition of 'mono' in the context of a constant function.\n   - Demonstrate that f n = a and f m = a for any n and m.\n   - Use the reflexivity of ≤ to show that a ≤ a.\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce variables and hypotheses.\n   - Use 'simp' or 'dsimp' to simplify function applications.\n   - Use 'rfl' or 'refl' for reflexivity proofs.\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of the constant function definition.\n   - Make sure to address the universally quantified nature of the 'mono' definition.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Check that the proof satisfies the 'mono' definition for the constant function.\n   - Ensure all introduced variables and hypotheses are properly used or cleared.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the current state of the proof and the reflection on the previous attempt, here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. The proof structure is correct, starting with introducing the variables and hypothesis using 'intro n m h'. This step should be kept.\n\n2. The 'simp' tactic was too powerful and simplified the goal excessively. We should replace it with 'dsimp' to only unfold the definition of the constant function without performing additional simplifications.\n\n3. After applying 'dsimp', we expect the goal to be of the form 'a ≤ a', which is a perfect candidate for the reflexivity tactic 'rfl'.\n\n4. The 'rfl' tactic should then complete the proof by showing that 'a ≤ a' is true by reflexivity of the less-than-or-equal relation on integers.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should modify the proof as follows:\n1. Keep the 'intro n m h' step.\n2. Replace 'simp' with 'dsimp'.\n3. Keep the 'rfl' step.\n\nThis approach should unfold the constant function definition, reduce the goal to 'a ≤ a', and then prove it by reflexivity, thus completing the proof of monotonicity for the constant function.\n",
