    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the problem:\n   - We need to prove that a constant function is monotonic.\n   - The theorem name is 'const_mono' with parameter 'a : ℤ'.\n   - The 'mono' definition is given, which defines monotonicity for integer functions.\n\n2. Understand the goal:\n   - We need to show that for any constant function f(x) = a, where a is an integer,\n     the function satisfies the monotonicity property.\n\n3. Outline the proof structure:\n   - Begin by introducing the variables n and m, and the hypothesis n ≤ m.\n   - Show that f n ≤ f m for the constant function f(x) = a.\n\n4. Key steps in the proof:\n   - Expand the definition of 'mono' in the context of a constant function.\n   - Demonstrate that f n = a and f m = a for any n and m.\n   - Use the reflexivity of ≤ to show that a ≤ a.\n\n5. Tactics to consider:\n   - Use 'intro' to introduce variables and hypotheses.\n   - Use 'simp' or 'dsimp' to simplify function applications.\n   - Use 'rfl' or 'refl' for reflexivity proofs.\n\n6. Potential challenges:\n   - Ensure proper handling of the constant function definition.\n   - Make sure to address the universally quantified nature of the 'mono' definition.\n\n7. Verification:\n   - Check that the proof satisfies the 'mono' definition for the constant function.\n   - Ensure all introduced variables and hypotheses are properly used or cleared.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo prove that a constant function is monotonic, we need to follow these logical steps:\n\n1. Begin by introducing the variables and hypothesis from the 'mono' definition:\n   - We need to introduce two integer variables, let's call them 'n' and 'm'.\n   - We also need to introduce the hypothesis that n ≤ m.\n\n2. Next, we need to prove that f n ≤ f m for our constant function f(x) = a:\n   - Since f is a constant function that always returns 'a', we know that f n = a and f m = a.\n   - Therefore, we need to show that a ≤ a, which is true by reflexivity of ≤ for integers.\n\n3. The proof structure should look like this:\n   - Introduce n, m, and the hypothesis n ≤ m\n   - Show that f n = a and f m = a\n   - Conclude that a ≤ a\n\n4. We can use the following tactics:\n   - 'intro' to introduce variables and hypotheses\n   - 'simp' or 'dsimp' to simplify the function applications\n   - 'rfl' or 'refl' for the final step showing a ≤ a\n\nGiven this reasoning, the acting agent should start by using the 'intro' tactic to introduce the necessary variables and hypothesis. This will set up the proof structure for the subsequent steps.\n",
    "reflection": "Here's my reflection on the current situation:\n\n```\nFlaw: The proof failed because the 'simp' tactic simplified the goal too much, leaving no goals to be solved when 'rfl' was applied.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'simp' with 'dsimp' to only simplify definitions without performing additional simplifications, then use 'rfl' to complete the proof.\n```\n\nThe current approach was close, but it encountered an issue due to over-simplification. The 'simp' tactic is powerful and sometimes simplifies more than we intend. In this case, it simplified the goal to the point where there was nothing left to prove when 'rfl' was applied.\n\nTo improve the proof process:\n\n1. We should use 'dsimp' instead of 'simp'. 'dsimp' (definitional simplification) will unfold the definition of the constant function without performing additional simplifications.\n\n2. After 'dsimp', we should still have a goal of the form 'a ≤ a', which can then be solved by 'rfl'.\n\n3. We should be careful to check the state of our proof after each tactic application to ensure we're making progress without oversimplifying.\n\n4. If we encounter similar issues in the future, we might consider using more fine-grained tactics or combining tactics with specific simplification lemmas to have more control over the simplification process.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we should be able to complete the proof successfully in the next attempt.",
