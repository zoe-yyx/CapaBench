Break down the bi-implication:\n   - We need to prove two directions:\n     a) P ∧ (P ∨ Q) → P\n     b) P → P ∧ (P ∨ Q)\n\n3. Plan for proving P ∧ (P ∨ Q) → P:\n   - This direction is straightforward\n   - Use conjunction elimination (and.left) to extract P from P ∧ (P ∨ Q)\n\n4. Plan for proving P → P ∧ (P ∨ Q):\n   - This direction requires constructing a conjunction\n   - For the left side of the conjunction, use the given P\n   - For the right side, construct P ∨ Q using or.inl with the given P\n\n5. Combine the proofs:\n   - Use iff.intro to combine both directions of the proof\n\n6. Consider using tactics:\n   - apply iff.intro\n   - exact and.left\n   - constructor\n   - exact\n   - apply Or.inl\n\n7. Reflect on the proof:\n   - Ensure all steps are logically sound\n   - Check that both directions of the bi-implication are properly addressed\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the given problem and planning strategy, here's the reasoning to guide the acting agent's next proving operation:\n\n1. Start by applying the iff.intro tactic. This will split our goal into two implications that we need to prove separately:\n   a) P ∧ (P ∨ Q) → P\n   b) P → P ∧ (P ∨ Q)\n\n2. For the first implication (P ∧ (P ∨ Q) → P):\n   - This is straightforward as we can simply extract P from the conjunction.\n   - Use the and.left tactic to prove this direction.\n\n3. For the second implication (P → P ∧ (P ∨ Q)):\n   - We need to construct a conjunction.\n   - Use the constructor tactic to split this goal into two subgoals:\n     i) P\n     ii) P ∨ Q\n\n4. For the first subgoal (P), we can use the exact tactic with the given hypothesis.\n\n5. For the second subgoal (P ∨ Q), we can use Or.inl to prove it, as we have P available.\n\nThis reasoning follows the planning strategy and provides a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem. The acting agent should follow these steps to construct the proof.\n",
