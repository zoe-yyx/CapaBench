    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is named 'modusPonens'\n   - It takes two propositions P and Q as parameters\n   - The goal is to prove: P ∧ (P → Q) → Q\n\n2. Understand the logical structure:\n   - This is a classic modus ponens logical rule\n   - We need to show that if we have P and (P implies Q), then we can conclude Q\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis:\n      - Assume P ∧ (P → Q) is true\n   \n   b. Deconstruct the conjunction:\n      - Extract P from the left side of the conjunction\n      - Extract (P → Q) from the right side of the conjunction\n   \n   c. Apply modus ponens:\n      - Use the extracted P and (P → Q) to conclude Q\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - cases: to deconstruct the conjunction\n   - apply: to apply the implication\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the final goal Q is reached\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any alternative or more concise ways to prove this theorem\n   - Think about how this proof relates to other logical rules and theorems\n",
    "reasoning": "\nBased on the current state of the proof and our planning strategy, we can reason about the next steps as follows:\n\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypothesis 'h' of type P ∧ (P → Q) using the 'intro' tactic.\n\n2. Our current goal is to prove Q, given that we have h : P ∧ (P → Q).\n\n3. The next logical step is to deconstruct the conjunction in our hypothesis 'h'. We need to extract both P and (P → Q) from it.\n\n4. After deconstructing the conjunction, we will have two separate pieces of information:\n   - P is true\n   - P → Q is true\n\n5. Once we have these separate pieces, we can apply the implication P → Q to P to conclude Q.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning suggests that the next operation should focus on deconstructing the conjunction in hypothesis 'h'. This can be achieved using the 'cases' tactic in Lean 4. After that, we'll be in a position to apply the modus ponens rule directly.\n",
