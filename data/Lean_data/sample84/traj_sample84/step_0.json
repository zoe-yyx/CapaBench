    "planning_context": "\n1. Analyze the theorem structure:\n   - The theorem is named 'modusPonens'\n   - It takes two propositions P and Q as parameters\n   - The goal is to prove: P ∧ (P → Q) → Q\n\n2. Understand the logical structure:\n   - This is a classic modus ponens logical rule\n   - We need to show that if we have P and (P implies Q), then we can conclude Q\n\n3. Plan the proof steps:\n   a. Introduce the hypothesis:\n      - Assume P ∧ (P → Q) is true\n   \n   b. Deconstruct the conjunction:\n      - Extract P from the left side of the conjunction\n      - Extract (P → Q) from the right side of the conjunction\n   \n   c. Apply modus ponens:\n      - Use the extracted P and (P → Q) to conclude Q\n\n4. Tactics to consider:\n   - intro: to introduce the hypothesis\n   - cases: to deconstruct the conjunction\n   - apply: to apply the implication\n\n5. Verification:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous ones\n   - Check that the final goal Q is reached\n\n6. Reflection:\n   - Consider if there are any alternative or more concise ways to prove this theorem\n   - Think about how this proof relates to other logical rules and theorems\n",
    "reasoning": "\nTo begin proving the theorem modusPonens, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduce the hypothesis:\n   The theorem statement is an implication, so we should start by introducing the left-hand side of the implication as a hypothesis. This will give us a working assumption to prove the right-hand side.\n\n2. Deconstruct the conjunction:\n   Our hypothesis will be of the form P ∧ (P → Q). We need to break this down into its constituent parts to work with them separately.\n\n3. Apply modus ponens:\n   Once we have P and (P → Q) as separate hypotheses, we can apply the modus ponens rule to derive Q.\n\nFor the acting agent's next operation, I recommend starting with step 1: introducing the hypothesis. This can be done using the 'intro' tactic in Lean 4. The acting agent should use this tactic to introduce a hypothesis that represents the left-hand side of the implication we're trying to prove.\n\nAfter this step, we'll be in a position to work with the conjunction P ∧ (P → Q) and proceed with the subsequent steps of the proof.\n",
