    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem logicEx3:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q over a type A.\n   - We need to prove an implication between two universal quantifications.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a).\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A.\n   - Introduce the negation of Q a as a hypothesis.\n\n3. Prove by contraposition:\n   - The goal is to show ¬ P a.\n   - Use contraposition: instead of proving ¬Q a → ¬P a, prove P a → Q a.\n\n4. Apply universal instantiation:\n   - Use the initial hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a) and instantiate it with the arbitrary 'a'.\n\n5. Use implication elimination:\n   - Apply modus ponens with the instantiated hypothesis and the assumption P a.\n\n6. Reach contradiction:\n   - The result Q a contradicts the assumption ¬Q a.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves ¬P a under the assumption ¬Q a.\n   - This establishes the implication ¬Q a → ¬P a for the arbitrary 'a'.\n   - Generalize to complete the proof of ∀ a : A, ¬Q a → ¬P a.\n\nThis plan outlines a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem using basic logical principles and quantifier manipulation in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nThe current proof attempt has encountered an error due to the use of 'by_contrapositive', which is not a valid tactic in Lean 4. To proceed with the proof using contraposition, we need to adjust our approach using Lean 4 compatible tactics. Here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Use 'push_neg' tactic:\n   This will transform the goal from '¬P a' to 'P a → False', effectively setting up the contrapositive structure.\n\n2. Introduce the assumption with 'intro':\n   After pushing the negation, introduce 'P a' as an assumption. This aligns with the contrapositive approach, where we assume P a and aim to derive a contradiction.\n\n3. Apply the universal quantification:\n   Use 'have' tactic to apply the hypothesis 'h' to 'a', which will give us 'P a → Q a' for the specific 'a' we're working with.\n\n4. Use modus ponens:\n   Apply the result from step 3 to our assumption 'P a' to derive 'Q a'.\n\n5. Reach contradiction:\n   Use 'exact' tactic to apply 'notQ' to 'Q a', which will prove 'False' and complete the contrapositive argument.\n\nThis approach maintains the logical structure of the original plan while using Lean 4 compatible tactics. It avoids the use of 'by_contrapositive' and instead breaks down the contraposition into its constituent logical steps.\n",
