    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem logicEx3:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q over a type A.\n   - We need to prove an implication between two universal quantifications.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a).\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A.\n   - Introduce the negation of Q a as a hypothesis.\n\n3. Prove by contraposition:\n   - The goal is to show ¬ P a.\n   - Use contraposition: instead of proving ¬Q a → ¬P a, prove P a → Q a.\n\n4. Apply universal instantiation:\n   - Use the initial hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a) and instantiate it with the arbitrary 'a'.\n\n5. Use implication elimination:\n   - Apply modus ponens with the instantiated hypothesis and the assumption P a.\n\n6. Reach contradiction:\n   - The result Q a contradicts the assumption ¬Q a.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves ¬P a under the assumption ¬Q a.\n   - This establishes the implication ¬Q a → ¬P a for the arbitrary 'a'.\n   - Generalize to complete the proof of ∀ a : A, ¬Q a → ¬P a.\n\nThis plan outlines a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem using basic logical principles and quantifier manipulation in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven that we're at the beginning of the proof with no historical actions, we should start by following the first steps of our planning strategy. The initial steps involve setting up the proof structure and introducing the necessary hypotheses.\n\nOur reasoning for the next steps should be:\n\n1. Introduce the main hypothesis of the theorem: (∀ a : A, P a → Q a). This will be our starting point for the proof.\n\n2. To prove the goal (∀ a : A, ¬ Q a → ¬ P a), we need to work with an arbitrary 'a' of type A and show that ¬ Q a implies ¬ P a for this arbitrary 'a'.\n\n3. Instead of directly proving ¬ Q a → ¬ P a, we can use contraposition. This means we'll assume P a and try to prove Q a, which is equivalent to proving ¬ Q a → ¬ P a.\n\n4. After setting up these initial steps, we'll be in a position to apply the universal instantiation of our main hypothesis to the arbitrary 'a' we introduced.\n\nTherefore, the acting agent should focus on introducing the main hypothesis, fixing an arbitrary 'a', and setting up the contrapositive form of the goal. This will create the necessary structure for the subsequent steps of the proof.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The use of 'by_contrapositive' tactic is incorrect in Lean 4, leading to an \"unknown tactic\" error.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'by_contrapositive' with the correct Lean 4 syntax for contraposition, such as using 'push_neg' and 'intro' tactics to achieve the same logical effect.\n```\n\nThe reflection identifies that the main issue in the current proof attempt is the use of an incorrect tactic 'by_contrapositive', which is not recognized in Lean 4. This error prevents the proof from progressing further.\n\nTo improve the proof process, we need to adjust our approach to contraposition in Lean 4. Instead of using 'by_contrapositive', we should use a combination of other tactics that achieve the same logical effect. Here's a more detailed strategy for improvement:\n\n1. After introducing 'notQ', we should use 'push_neg' to push the negation inward. This will transform our goal from '¬P a' to 'P a → False'.\n\n2. Then, we can use 'intro' to assume 'P a', which sets us up to prove 'False' under this assumption.\n\n3. From there, we can apply our hypothesis 'h' to 'a' and 'Pa' to derive 'Q a'.\n\n4. Finally, we can use 'exact' to apply 'notQ' to 'Q a', which will prove 'False' and complete the proof.\n\nThis approach maintains the logical structure of contraposition without relying on the unavailable 'by_contrapositive' tactic. It also aligns better with Lean 4's syntax and available tactics.\n\nFor future steps, the acting agent should focus on implementing this revised strategy, carefully using Lean 4 compatible tactics to complete the proof. The reasoning agent should be mindful of Lean 4 specific syntax and tactics, avoiding reliance on tactics that may have been available in earlier versions of Lean but are not part of Lean 4.",
