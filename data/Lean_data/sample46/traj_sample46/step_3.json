    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem logicEx3:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q over a type A.\n   - We need to prove an implication between two universal quantifications.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a).\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A.\n   - Introduce the negation of Q a as a hypothesis.\n\n3. Prove by contraposition:\n   - The goal is to show ¬ P a.\n   - Use contraposition: instead of proving ¬Q a → ¬P a, prove P a → Q a.\n\n4. Apply universal instantiation:\n   - Use the initial hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a) and instantiate it with the arbitrary 'a'.\n\n5. Use implication elimination:\n   - Apply modus ponens with the instantiated hypothesis and the assumption P a.\n\n6. Reach contradiction:\n   - The result Q a contradicts the assumption ¬Q a.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves ¬P a under the assumption ¬Q a.\n   - This establishes the implication ¬Q a → ¬P a for the arbitrary 'a'.\n   - Generalize to complete the proof of ∀ a : A, ¬Q a → ¬P a.\n\nThis plan outlines a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem using basic logical principles and quantifier manipulation in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\n1. We have successfully introduced the hypotheses and set up the goal to prove ¬P a.\n\n2. To prove ¬P a, we need to show that assuming P a leads to a contradiction.\n\n3. Let's introduce P a as a hypothesis and then aim to derive False. This is equivalent to the contradiction we're seeking.\n\n4. After introducing P a, we'll use the universal quantification h with our specific a to get P a → Q a.\n\n5. We can then apply modus ponens with P a → Q a and our assumption P a to derive Q a.\n\n6. Having both Q a and ¬Q a will give us the contradiction we need.\n\n7. We'll use 'exact' or 'apply' with the appropriate contradiction to finish the proof.\n\nThis approach maintains the logical structure of our original plan while using Lean 4 compatible tactics.\n",
