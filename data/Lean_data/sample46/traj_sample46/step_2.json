    "planning_context": "\nStrategic Proving Plan for theorem logicEx3:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - The theorem involves two predicates P and Q over a type A.\n   - We need to prove an implication between two universal quantifications.\n\n2. Set up the proof:\n   - Start by introducing the hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a).\n   - Introduce an arbitrary element 'a' of type A.\n   - Introduce the negation of Q a as a hypothesis.\n\n3. Prove by contraposition:\n   - The goal is to show ¬ P a.\n   - Use contraposition: instead of proving ¬Q a → ¬P a, prove P a → Q a.\n\n4. Apply universal instantiation:\n   - Use the initial hypothesis (∀ a : A, P a → Q a) and instantiate it with the arbitrary 'a'.\n\n5. Use implication elimination:\n   - Apply modus ponens with the instantiated hypothesis and the assumption P a.\n\n6. Reach contradiction:\n   - The result Q a contradicts the assumption ¬Q a.\n\n7. Conclude the proof:\n   - The contradiction proves ¬P a under the assumption ¬Q a.\n   - This establishes the implication ¬Q a → ¬P a for the arbitrary 'a'.\n   - Generalize to complete the proof of ∀ a : A, ¬Q a → ¬P a.\n\nThis plan outlines a step-by-step approach to prove the theorem using basic logical principles and quantifier manipulation in Lean 4.\n",
    "reasoning": "\nGiven the current state of the proof and the reflection on the previous attempt, we should focus on proving the contrapositive directly without using the 'push_neg' tactic. The reasoning for the next steps is as follows:\n\n1. We have already introduced the necessary hypotheses: 'h' for the universal quantification, 'a' as an arbitrary element of type A, and 'notQ' as the negation of Q a.\n\n2. To prove ¬P a, we should use proof by contradiction. We'll assume P a and derive a contradiction.\n\n3. Introduce P a as an assumption. This sets up the contradiction we're aiming for.\n\n4. Use the universal quantification 'h' with the specific 'a' we have to get the implication P a → Q a for this particular 'a'.\n\n5. Apply modus ponens with the implication from step 4 and our assumption P a to derive Q a.\n\n6. Now we have both Q a (derived) and ¬Q a (given as notQ). This is a contradiction.\n\n7. By reaching this contradiction, we prove that our assumption P a must be false, thereby establishing ¬P a.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with the structure of contraposition and uses only tactics that are compatible with Lean 4. It directly addresses the goal without unnecessary transformations and should lead to a successful proof of the theorem.\n",
    "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The proof attempt used the 'by_contradiction' tactic, which is not available in Lean 4.\n\nImprovement: Replace 'by_contradiction' with 'intro' to assume P a, then use 'apply False.elim' to set up the contradiction as the goal.\n```\n\nThe current proof attempt was on the right track in terms of the logical structure, but it encountered an error due to the use of a tactic that is not available in Lean 4. The 'by_contradiction' tactic, which was commonly used in Lean 3, is not part of the Lean 4 tactic library.\n\nTo improve the proof, we should adjust our approach to achieve the same logical structure without relying on 'by_contradiction'. Here's how we can modify our strategy:\n\n1. Instead of using 'by_contradiction', we can use 'intro' to assume P a. This effectively sets up the proof by contradiction without using a specific tactic for it.\n\n2. After assuming P a, we should use 'apply False.elim' to set our goal to proving False. This is equivalent to deriving a contradiction.\n\n3. The rest of the proof can proceed as planned: apply the universal quantification to get P a → Q a, use this with our assumption to derive Q a, and then show that this contradicts our given ¬Q a.\n\n4. To finish the proof, we'll need to use 'exact' or 'apply' to show that we've reached a contradiction.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we maintain the logical structure of our proof while using tactics that are compatible with Lean 4. This should allow us to successfully complete the proof of the theorem.",
