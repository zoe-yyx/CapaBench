Dave PICK bread_slice2\n16. Dave PUT bread_slice2 cucumber\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Based on the current scene description and action history, I can see that we're at step 12 of the abstract plan. Dave is currently holding the bacon, which is the next item to be placed on the sandwich. Let's think through the next few steps:\n\n1. Current step (12): Dave should PUT bacon on ham\n2. Next step (13): Chad should PICK cucumber\n3. Then (14): Chad should PUT cucumber on bacon\n4. After that (15): Dave should PICK bread_slice2\n5. Finally (16): Dave should PUT bread_slice2 on cucumber\n\nReasoning through these steps:\n\n1. Dave is already holding the bacon, so he can immediately PUT it on the ham.\n2. After that, Chad needs to handle the cucumber, which is on his side (right side) of the table.\n3. Once Chad puts the cucumber on the bacon, Dave will need to pick up the final bread slice.\n4. The last step will be Dave putting the bread_slice2 on top to complete the sandwich.\n\n```reasoning\nDave should PUT bacon on ham in this round. In the next round, Chad should PICK cucumber to prepare for the next layer of the sandwich. This will allow for efficient completion of the remaining steps of the sandwich-making process.\n```"
