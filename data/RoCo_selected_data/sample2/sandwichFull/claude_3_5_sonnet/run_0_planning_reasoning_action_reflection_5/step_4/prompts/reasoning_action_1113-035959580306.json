Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"
