Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

The bread_slice1 is on the cutting_board, and the tomato is atop the bread_slice1. Now we need to continue with the next steps of the plan.\n\nLet's reason about the current situation and the next few steps:\n\n1. The next item in the recipe is beef_patty, which is on the right side of the table.\n2. Chad can reach the right side, so Chad should PICK the beef_patty.\n3. After picking the beef_patty, Chad should PUT it on top of the tomato.\n4. The next item after beef_patty is cheese, which is on the left side of the table.\n5. Dave can reach the left side, so Dave should PICK the cheese in the next round.\n6. After that, Dave should PUT the cheese on top of the beef_patty.\n\nGiven this reasoning, here's what the robots should do in the current round and the next few rounds:\n\nCurrent round:\n- Chad: PICK beef_patty\n- Dave: WAIT\n\nNext round:\n- Chad: PUT beef_patty tomato\n- Dave: WAIT\n\nFollowing round:\n- Chad: WAIT\n- Dave: PICK cheese\n\nRound after that:\n- Chad: WAIT\n- Dave: PUT cheese beef_patty\n\nThis plan follows the recipe order and utilizes both robots efficiently based on their reach limitations.\n\n```reasoning\nThe next step is to add the beef_patty to the sandwich. Chad should PICK the beef_patty from the right side of the table, then PUT it on top of the tomato in the next round. Meanwhile, Dave should WAIT as there's no action for him to take on the left side at this moment. In the following rounds, Dave will PICK and PUT the cheese, while Chad waits.\n```"
