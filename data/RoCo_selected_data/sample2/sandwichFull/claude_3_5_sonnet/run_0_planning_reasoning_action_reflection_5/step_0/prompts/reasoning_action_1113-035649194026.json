Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Thank you for providing the context and rules for the sandwich-making task with Chad and Dave robots. I'll analyze the current situation and plan the next steps.\n\nGiven the scene description, we can see that the ingredients are divided between the left and right sides of the table. Dave can reach the left side, while Chad can reach the right side. The first step in our abstract plan is for Dave to pick up bread_slice1, which is on the left side of the table.\n\nLet's start the reasoning process:\n\n1. Dave should PICK bread_slice1 from the left side of the table.\n2. After picking up bread_slice1, Dave will need to PUT it on the cutting_board.\n3. Chad can then prepare to PICK the tomato from the right side of the table.\n\nThis sequence follows the first three steps of our abstract plan and sets up the foundation for building the sandwich.\n\n```reasoning\nIn the current step, Dave should PICK bread_slice1 from the left side of the table. This action initiates the sandwich-making process and follows the first step of our abstract plan. In the next step, Dave will need to PUT bread_slice1 on the cutting_board, while Chad can prepare to pick up the tomato. This sequence ensures efficient use of both robots and adheres to the required stacking order for the sandwich ingredients.\n```"
