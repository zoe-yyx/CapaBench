Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Based on the scene description and action history, I'll analyze the current state and plan the next steps:\n\n1. The sandwich construction is progressing well, with bacon currently on top of the stack.\n2. Chad is holding the cucumber, which is the next ingredient to be added according to the recipe.\n3. Dave's gripper is empty, and bread_slice2 is still on the left side of the table.\n\nLet's plan the next few steps:\n\n1. Chad should PUT the cucumber on top of the bacon.\n2. After that, Dave needs to PICK up bread_slice2.\n3. Then, Dave should PUT bread_slice2 on top of the cucumber to complete the sandwich.\n\nReasoning for these steps:\n- Chad already has the cucumber, so he can immediately place it on the stack.\n- Dave is free to pick up the final ingredient (bread_slice2) while Chad is putting down the cucumber.\n- This approach maximizes efficiency by having both robots active when possible.\n\n```reasoning\nChad should PUT cucumber on bacon. Then, Dave will PICK bread_slice2 and PUT it on top of cucumber to complete the sandwich. This plan utilizes both robots efficiently and follows the correct order of ingredients.\n```"
