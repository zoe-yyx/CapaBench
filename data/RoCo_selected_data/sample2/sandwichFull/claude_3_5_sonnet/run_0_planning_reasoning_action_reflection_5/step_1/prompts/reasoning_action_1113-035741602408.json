Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Thank you for providing the context and rules for the sandwich-making task. I'll analyze the current situation and plan the next steps for Chad and Dave.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- bread_slice1 is already on the cutting_board (steps 1-2 of the abstract plan are complete)\n- The next item in the recipe is tomato, which is on Chad's side (right side)\n\nLet's plan the next few steps:\n\n1. Chad should PICK the tomato\n2. Chad should then PUT the tomato on bread_slice1\n3. After that, Chad should PICK the beef_patty\n4. Chad should then PUT the beef_patty on the tomato\n5. Meanwhile, Dave should prepare to PICK the cheese (next item after beef_patty)\n\nReasoning for these steps:\n- We're following the recipe order: bread_slice1, tomato, beef_patty, cheese, etc.\n- Chad has access to the tomato and beef_patty, so he should handle those steps\n- Dave should prepare for the next item he can reach (cheese) to maintain efficiency\n\n```reasoning\nFor the current round, Chad should PICK the tomato as it's the next item in the recipe and it's on his side of the table. Dave should WAIT as there's no action for him to take at this moment. In the next round, Chad will likely PUT the tomato on bread_slice1, while Dave continues to WAIT. Following that, Chad will likely PICK and PUT the beef_patty, while Dave prepares to handle the cheese in subsequent rounds.\n```\n\nBased on this reasoning, the actions for the current round should be:\n\nChad: PICK tomato\nDave: WAIT"
