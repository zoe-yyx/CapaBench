Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Based on the scene description and action history, the robots have successfully opened both cabinet doors and placed the cup on its correct coaster. Now, we need to proceed with retrieving the mug and placing it on its correct coaster. Let's analyze the current situation and plan the next steps:\n\n1. Alice and Bob are currently holding the left and right cabinet doors open, respectively. This is crucial as it allows access to the items inside the cabinet.\n\n2. Chad has just completed placing the cup on its coaster and is now available to retrieve the mug.\n\n3. The mug is still inside the cabinet and needs to be retrieved and placed on its correct coaster.\n\n4. Once the mug is placed, the task will be complete.\n\nGiven this information, here's the reasoning for the next steps:\n\n1. Alice and Bob should continue to WAIT, holding the cabinet doors open. This ensures Chad can access the mug inside the cabinet.\n\n2. Chad should PICK the mug from inside the cabinet and PLACE it on the mug coaster.\n\n3. After Chad completes this action, the task will be finished, but Alice and Bob should continue to hold the doors open until instructed otherwise.\n\n```reasoning\nAlice and Bob should continue to WAIT, holding the cabinet doors open.
