Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Based on the scene description and the executed actions from Round 0, I can see that Alice and Bob have already picked the left and right door handles respectively, while Chad is waiting. This aligns with step 1 of our abstract plan. Now, we need to proceed to step 2, which involves opening both doors.\n\nLet's reason through the next steps:\n\n1. Current state: Alice and Bob are holding the door handles, Chad is waiting.\n\n2. Next step (Round 1):\n   - Alice should OPEN the left door\n   - Bob should OPEN the right door\n   - Chad should continue to WAIT, as the doors are not yet open for him to retrieve items\n\n3. Following step (Round 2):\n   - Alice should WAIT to hold the left door open\n   - Bob should WAIT to hold the right door open\n   - Chad can now PICK the cup and PLACE it on the correct coaster\n\n4. Subsequent step (Round 3):\n   - Alice continues to WAIT, holding the left door\n   - Bob continues to WAIT, holding the right door\n   - Chad should PICK the mug and PLACE it on the correct coaster\n\nThis reasoning follows our abstract plan efficiently and ensures that all robots are coordinated to complete the task without collision.\n\n```reasoning\nIn the current round (Round 1), Alice and Bob should OPEN their respective doors while Chad continues to WAIT. This will set up the environment for Chad to retrieve the items in the next round. The subsequent rounds will involve Alice and Bob holding the doors open while Chad retrieves and places the cup and mug on their correct coasters.\n```"
