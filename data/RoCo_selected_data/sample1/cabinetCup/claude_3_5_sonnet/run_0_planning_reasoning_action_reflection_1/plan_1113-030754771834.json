Robots must coordinate to complete the task most efficiently while avoiding collision.\nAt each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. \nEach robot does **exactly** one ACTION per round, selected from only one of the above 4 options.\n\n\n[Action Options]\n1) PICK <handle>.\n2) OPEN <handle>.\n3) PICK <object> PLACE <location>, <object> can be either cup or mug; PICK and PLACE is considered one single ACTION, i.e. you must always PICK and PLACE together\n4) WAIT: stays at current position, choose WAIT to hold the door open.\n<handle> must be either left or right door handle. Only OPEN a door after you already PICKed its handle, after you OPENed a door, must WAIT at the same spot to hold it open. \n<object> must be either mug or cup, <location> must be the correct coaster\n\n[Scene description]\nleft door is closed, left_door_handle is at (-0.4, 0.4, 0.5), right door is closed, right_door_handle is at (-0.4, 0.6, 0.5), \nmug is inside cabinet; cup is inside cabinet; \nAlice's gripper is at (0.4 -0.1 0.5), holding nothing, \nBob's gripper is at (-0.1 1.3 0.6), holding nothing, \nChad's gripper is at (1.1 1.2 0.4), holding nothing, \n\nYou are an advanced intelligent system responsible for guiding multiple robots to collaborate on tasks in a desktop operating environment. Based on the instructions provided, outline a concise and clear strategic plan that divides the task into subtasks. Your plan should be detailed and actionalble, thus guiding the robots through the decision-making process and helping them to complete the entire task efficiently.\nAfter your thinking, you should output your plan like\n```plan\nPut your plan here\n```\nYour thinking and your plan are:\n"

        "message": "Here's my thinking and plan for the robots to efficiently complete the task:\n\n1. We need to open both cabinet doors before accessing the cup and mug.\n2. Two robots should open the doors while the third prepares to retrieve items.\n3. Once doors are open, one robot should hold each door while the third retrieves and places items.\n4. We'll get the cup first, then the mug, as specified in the task order.\n5. We'll assign roles based on initial positions to minimize movement.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here's the strategic plan:\n\n```plan\n1. Alice: PICK left_door_handle\n   Bob: PICK right_door_handle\n   Chad: WAIT (prepare to retrieve items)\n\n2. Alice: OPEN left door\n   Bob: OPEN right door\n   Chad: WAIT (prepare to retrieve items)\n\n3. Alice: WAIT (hold left door)\n   Bob: WAIT (hold right door)\n   Chad: PICK cup PLACE correct coaster\n\n4. Alice: WAIT (hold left door)\n   Bob: WAIT (hold right door)\n   Chad: PICK mug PLACE correct coaster\n\n5. Alice: WAIT (task complete, maintain door position)\n   Bob: WAIT (task complete, maintain door position)\n   Chad: WAIT (task complete)\n```\n\nThis plan efficiently divides the task among the three robots, minimizing movement and ensuring all steps are completed in the correct order. Alice and Bob open and hold the doors, while Chad retrieves and places both the cup and mug."
