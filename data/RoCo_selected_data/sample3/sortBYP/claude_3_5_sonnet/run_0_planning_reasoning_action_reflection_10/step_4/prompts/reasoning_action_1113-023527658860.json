Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

The cubes are currently in their starting positions:\n   - blue_square is in panel2\n   - yellow_trapezoid is in panel4\n   - pink_polygon is on panel7\n\n2. Looking at the abstract plan, we need to start with Chad moving the blue_square to panel5. However, Chad can't reach the blue_square in its current position.\n\n3. We need to modify our approach:\n   - Alice can reach the blue_square in panel2\n   - Bob can reach panel3, which is within Alice's reach\n   - Chad can reach panel5\n\n4. So, we should start with:\n   a. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel3\n   b. Bob: PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n   c. Chad: PICK blue_square PLACE panel6 (to get it out of the way)\n\n5. For the yellow_trapezoid:\n   - It's already in panel4, which is Bob's target panel\n   - No action needed for yellow_trapezoid\n\n6. For the pink_polygon:\n   - It's currently in panel7, within Chad's reach\n   - We need to move it to panel6, which is also within Chad's reach\n\n7. So, after moving the blue_square, we can have:\n   d. Chad: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel6\n\n```reasoning\nThe most efficient plan is:\n1. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel3\n2.
