They form a straight assembly line, panel1 is closed to panel2 and farthest from panel7.\nThere are 3 cubes, each robot must place their cube on the correct target, their (cube, target_panel) pairs: \nAlice: (blue_square, panel2), \nBob: (yellow_trapezoid, panel4), \nChad: (pink_polygon, panel6).\nThere are 3 robots, each with a limited reach range, this means they can only pick cubes from these panels, and can only place cubes on these panels. The (robot, [reachable_panels]) pairs: \n(Alice, [panel1, panel2, panel3])\n(Bob, [panel3, panel4, panel5])\n(Chad, [panel5, panel6, panel7])\n\n\n[Action Options]\n1) PICK <object name> PLACE <location>\n2) WAIT\nOnly PICK an object if your gripper is empty. Target <location> for PLACE should be panel or a bin.[Action Output Instruction]\nYou must first output 'EXECUTE\n', then give **exactly** one action per robot, put each on a new line.\nExample: 'EXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: PICK red_square PLACE panel3\nNAME: Bob ACTION: WAIT\nNAME: Chad ACTION: PICK green_trapezoid PLACE panel6\n'\nIf actions for multiple steps are to generate, repeat the above process and follow the format strictly.\nExample: 'EXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: WAIT\nNAME: Bob ACTION: WAIT\nNAME: Chad ACTION: PICK blue_square PLACE panel7\nEXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel1\nNAME: Bob ACTION: WAIT\nNAME: Chad ACTION: WAIT\n'\n\n[Scene description]\nblue_square is on panel3\npink_polygon is on panel7\nyellow_trapezoid is in panel4\nAlice's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: blue_square, can't reach cubes: pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid, \nBob's gripper is empty, can reach cubes: blue_square, yellow_trapezoid, can't reach cubes: pink_polygon, \nChad's gripper is empty,can't reach cubes: blue_square, pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid,.\n\nBased on the current state, in order to complete task, someone proposed EXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\nNAME: Bob ACTION: WAIT\nNAME: Chad ACTION: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel5 as action for the next step.\nHowever, this action failed to employ in the env. Usually, the failure may be due to one of the following reasons.\n1.Response does not contain some keyword. The keywords in this env includes ['NAME:', 'ACTION:'].\n2.Response missing plan for some robot. The robot in this env includes dict_values(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Chad']).\n3.Reponse must contain exactly one ACTION for each robot, and must contain all keywords. The keywords in this env includes ['NAME:', 'ACTION:'].\n4.Bad action for some robot, this robot at current state can only MOVE or WAIT. The robot in this env includes dict_values(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Chad']).\n5.Planned PATH must have exact same number of steps of all agents.\nYou should think about which reason is most possible for the failure of the past action, you should clearly output the reason to help yourself to genetate better reasoning and action in future.\nAfter your thinking, you should output your reflection like\n```reflection\nPut your reflection here\n```\nYour thinking and reflection are:\n"
