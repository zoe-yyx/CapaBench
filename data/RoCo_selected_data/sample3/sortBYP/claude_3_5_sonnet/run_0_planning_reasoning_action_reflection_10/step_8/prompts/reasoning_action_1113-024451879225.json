Response must contain exactly one ACTION for each robot, and must contain all keywords. The keywords in this env includes ['NAME:', 'ACTION:'].\n\nThe proposed action has two issues:\n1. It's missing an action for Bob. While Bob is instructed to WAIT, this should still be explicitly stated as an action.\n2. Chad's action is invalid. Chad can only reach panels 5, 6, and 7, but the proposed action tries to place the pink_polygon on panel5, which is out of Chad's reach.\n\nTo correct this, we should ensure that each robot has a valid action, including explicit WAIT actions, and that all actions are within each robot's reach range.\nAn abstract plan on how to complete the task is 1. Chad: PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n2. Bob: PICK blue_square PLACE panel3\n3. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n4. Bob: PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel4\n5. Alice: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel3\n6. Bob: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel5\n7. Chad: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel6\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Thank you for the clarification. I'll provide a more detailed reasoning process and ensure that each robot has a valid action within their reach range.\n\nReasoning process:\n\n1. Current state:\n   - blue_square is on panel3\n   - pink_polygon is on panel7\n   - yellow_trapezoid is in panel4\n   - All robots' grippers are empty\n\n2. Step 1:\n   - Alice can reach blue_square on panel3, which needs to go to panel2\n   - Bob and Chad can't reach their target cubes yet\n   \n3. Step 2:\n   - Alice will have placed blue_square on panel2\n   - Bob can now reach yellow_trapezoid on panel4, which is its target location\n   - Chad still can't reach pink_polygon on panel7\n\n4. Step 3:\n   - Alice and Bob will have completed their tasks\n   - Chad still needs to move pink_polygon from panel7 to panel6\n\n5. Step 4:\n   - Chad can finally reach and move pink_polygon to its target location\n\nBased on this reasoning, here's the action plan for the current step:\n\n```reasoning\nAlice should pick up the blue_square from panel3 and place it on panel2.\nBob should wait as he can't reach his target cube yet.\nChad should wait as he can't reach his target cube yet.\n```\n\nNow, I'll provide the formatted output with the correct keywords:\n\nNAME: Alice\nACTION: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n\nNAME: Bob\nACTION: WAIT\n\nNAME: Chad\nACTION: WAIT"
