The pink_polygon is already on panel3, and Alice's target is to place the blue_square on panel2. This action does not contribute to completing the task and violates the rule of only picking up objects when necessary.\nAn abstract plan on how to complete the task is 1. Chad: PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n2. Bob: PICK blue_square PLACE panel3\n3. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n4. Bob: PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel4\n5. Alice: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel3\n6. Bob: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel5\n7. Chad: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel6\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

The blue_square is already in its target location (panel2), so we can skip the first three steps of the abstract plan.\n\n2. We should focus on moving the yellow_trapezoid to panel4 and the pink_polygon to panel6.\n\n3. Bob can directly pick up the yellow_trapezoid from panel3 and place it on panel4.\n\n4. For the pink_polygon, we need to move it from panel3 to panel6 using all three robots:\n   a. Bob can pick it up from panel3 and place it on panel5.\n   b. Chad can then pick it up from panel5 and place it on panel6.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the reasoning summary:\n\n```reasoning\n1. Bob should PICK yellow_trapezoid from panel3 and PLACE it on panel4.\n2. After that, Bob should PICK pink_polygon from panel3 and PLACE it on panel5.\n3.
