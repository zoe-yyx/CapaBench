Specifically:\n\n1. Alice can reach panel3 where the blue_square is, so her action to PICK blue_square is valid. However, she cannot PLACE it on panel2, as panel2 is not within her reach (she can only reach panels 1, 2, and 3).\n\n2. Chad cannot PICK the pink_polygon from panel7, as panel7 is outside his reach range (he can only reach panels 5, 6, and 7).\n\nThese violations of the reach constraints likely caused the action to fail. A correct plan should respect each robot's limited reach range when assigning PICK and PLACE actions.\nAn abstract plan on how to complete the task is 1. Chad: PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n2. Bob: PICK blue_square PLACE panel3\n3. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n4. Bob: PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel4\n5. Alice: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel3\n6. Bob: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel5\n7. Chad: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel6\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

The blue_square is currently on panel3, which is within Alice and Bob's reach.\n2. The yellow_trapezoid is already on its target panel4, so we don't need to move it.\n3. The pink_polygon is on panel7, which is only within Chad's reach.\n\nLet's plan the next few steps:\n\nStep 1: Alice should PICK the blue_square from panel3, as it's within her reach and needs to be moved to panel2.\n\nStep 2: Alice should PLACE the blue_square on panel2, which is her target panel and within her reach.\n\nStep 3: Chad should PICK the pink_polygon from panel7, as it's the only cube he can currently reach.\n\nStep 4: Chad should PLACE the pink_polygon on panel5, which is within his reach and will allow Bob to access it in the next step.\n\nStep 5: Bob should PICK the pink_polygon from panel5.\n\nStep 6: Bob should PLACE the pink_polygon on panel6, which is Chad's target panel and within Bob's reach.\n\nThis plan respects each robot's reach constraints and follows the general idea of the abstract plan while adapting to the current situation.\n\n```reasoning\nThe immediate actions should be:\n1. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n2. Chad: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel5\n3.
