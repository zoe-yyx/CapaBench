Response must contain exactly one ACTION for each robot, and must contain all keywords. The keywords in this env includes ['NAME:', 'ACTION:'].\n\nThe proposed action only includes actions for Alice and Chad, but is missing an action for Bob. Additionally, the format is incorrect as it's missing the 'NAME:' and 'ACTION:' keywords for each robot's action. The correct format should include an action for all three robots (Alice, Bob, and Chad) with the proper keywords.\nAn abstract plan on how to complete the task is 1. Chad: PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n2. Bob: PICK blue_square PLACE panel3\n3. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n4. Bob: PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel4\n5. Alice: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel3\n6. Bob: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel5\n7. Chad: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel6\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Thank you for the detailed information and the abstract plan. I'll analyze the current situation and provide a step-by-step reasoning for the next actions. Here's my thinking:\n\n1. Currently, the blue_square is in panel6, which is within Chad's reach. This aligns with step 1 of the abstract plan.\n\n2. Bob's cube (yellow_trapezoid) is already in its target position (panel4), so Bob doesn't need to move it.\n\n3. Chad needs to move the blue_square to panel5 so that Bob can reach it in the next step.\n\n4. Alice can't reach any cubes at the moment, so she should wait.\n\n5. After Chad moves the blue_square, Bob will be able to move it to panel3 in the next step.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here's the summary of actions for this step:\n\n```reasoning\nChad should pick up the blue_square from panel6 and place it on panel5. This will allow Bob to reach it in the next step.\nBob's cube is already in the correct position, so he should wait.\nAlice can't reach any cubes, so she should wait.\n```\n\nNow, I'll provide the actions for each robot in the correct format:\n\nNAME: Alice\nACTION: WAIT\n\nNAME: Bob\nACTION: WAIT\n\nNAME: Chad\nACTION: PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n\nThis set of actions follows the abstract plan, addresses the current situation, and is formatted correctly with the required keywords for each robot."
