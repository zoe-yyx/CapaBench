Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

Current state:\n   - blue_square is in panel2 (its target location)\n   - pink_polygon and yellow_trapezoid are on panel3\n   - All robot grippers are empty\n\n2. Next steps:\n   - The blue_square is already in its target location (panel2), so we can skip the first three steps of the abstract plan.\n   - We need to focus on moving the yellow_trapezoid to panel4 and the pink_polygon to panel6.\n\n3. Reasoning for the next actions:\n   - Bob can directly pick the yellow_trapezoid from panel3 and place it on panel4 (its target location).\n   - Alice can pick the pink_polygon from panel3 and move it to panel3 (the rightmost panel she can reach).\n   - Chad cannot reach any cubes yet, so he should wait.\n\n4. Future steps:\n   - After Bob places the yellow_trapezoid, he can pick up the pink_polygon from panel3 and move it to panel5.\n   - Then Chad can pick up the pink_polygon from panel5 and place it on its target location (panel6).\n\n5. Efficient execution:\n   - We can perform Bob's and Alice's actions simultaneously in the first step to save time.\n\n```reasoning\nIn the current state, the blue_square is already in its target location (panel2).
