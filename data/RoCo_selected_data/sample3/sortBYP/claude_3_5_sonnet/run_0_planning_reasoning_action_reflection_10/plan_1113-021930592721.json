They form a straight assembly line, panel1 is closed to panel2 and farthest from panel7.\nThere are 3 cubes, each robot must place their cube on the correct target, their (cube, target_panel) pairs: \nAlice: (blue_square, panel2), \nBob: (yellow_trapezoid, panel4), \nChad: (pink_polygon, panel6).\nThere are 3 robots, each with a limited reach range, this means they can only pick cubes from these panels, and can only place cubes on these panels. The (robot, [reachable_panels]) pairs: \n(Alice, [panel1, panel2, panel3])\n(Bob, [panel3, panel4, panel5])\n(Chad, [panel5, panel6, panel7])\n\n\n[Action Options]\n1) PICK <object name> PLACE <location>\n2) WAIT\nOnly PICK an object if your gripper is empty.

Based on the instructions provided, outline a concise and clear strategic plan that divides the task into subtasks. Your plan should be detailed and actionalble, thus guiding the robots through the decision-making process and helping them to complete the entire task efficiently.\nAfter your thinking, you should output your plan like\n```plan\nPut your plan here\n```\nYour thinking and your plan are:\n"

        "message": "To efficiently complete this task, we need to consider the current positions of the cubes, the reach ranges of each robot, and their target panels. Here's my strategic plan:\n\n1. Chad should move the blue_square from panel7 to panel5, as it's the closest reachable panel for both Chad and Bob.\n2. Bob should then move the blue_square from panel5 to panel3, which is within Alice's reach.\n3. Alice can then place the blue_square on its target, panel2.\n4. Bob can directly place the yellow_trapezoid on its target, panel4.\n5. Alice should move the pink_polygon from panel1 to panel3.\n6. Bob should then move the pink_polygon from panel3 to panel5.\n7. Finally, Chad can place the pink_polygon on its target, panel6.\n\nThis plan minimizes the number of moves and ensures that each robot only handles cubes within its reach range. Here's the actionable plan:\n\n```plan\n1. Chad: PICK blue_square PLACE panel5\n2. Bob: PICK blue_square PLACE panel3\n3. Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2\n4. Bob: PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel4\n5. Alice: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel3\n6. Bob: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel5\n7. Chad: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel6\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that all cubes are moved to their correct target panels while respecting the reach limitations of each robot."
