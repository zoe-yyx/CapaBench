        "message": "Based on the given instructions and scene description, I'll outline a strategic plan for Alice and Bob to efficiently complete the task of sweeping up the cubes in the correct order. Here's my thinking:\n\n1. The order of sweeping is crucial: green cube, then red cube, then blue cube.\n2. Both robots need to be at the same cube to perform the sweeping action.\n3. Alice holds the dustpan and can only MOVE, WAIT, or DUMP.\n4. Bob holds the broom and can MOVE or SWEEP.\n5. We need to coordinate their movements to minimize unnecessary actions.\n\nLet's break this down into subtasks:\n\n1. Move both robots to the green cube\n2. Sweep the green cube into the dustpan\n3. Dump the green cube into the trash bin\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the red cube\n5. Repeat steps 1-3 for the blue cube\n\nNow, let's create a detailed plan:\n\n```plan\n1. Alice MOVE green_cube\n2. Bob MOVE green_cube\n3. Alice WAIT\n4. Bob SWEEP green_cube\n5. Alice DUMP\n6. Alice MOVE red_cube\n7. Bob MOVE red_cube\n8. Alice WAIT\n9. Bob SWEEP red_cube\n10. Alice DUMP\n11. Alice MOVE blue_cube\n12. Bob MOVE blue_cube\n13. Alice WAIT\n14. Bob SWEEP blue_cube\n15. Alice DUMP\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that:\n1. The robots always move to the correct cube in the right order.\n2. Alice is in position with the dustpan before Bob sweeps.\n3. Alice dumps the cube into the trash bin after each sweep.\n4. The order of green, red, then blue cube is maintained.\n5. Each robot performs exactly one action per round.\n\nThis plan should efficiently guide Alice and Bob through the task, following all the given instructions and constraints."
