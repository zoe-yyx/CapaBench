Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Based on the scene description and action history, I can see that Alice and Bob have successfully swept the green cube and red cube into the trash bin. They are now positioned near the blue cube, which is the last cube to be swept up according to the required order.\n\nLet's analyze the current situation and plan the next steps:\n\n1. Alice is holding the dustpan and is 0.87 units away from the blue cube.\n2. Bob is holding the broom and is 0.35 units away from the blue cube.\n3. The next steps in our abstract plan are:\n   11. Alice MOVE blue_cube\n   12. Bob MOVE blue_cube\n   13. Alice WAIT\n   14. Bob SWEEP blue_cube\n   15. Alice DUMP\n\nGiven this information, here's my reasoning for the next actions:\n\n1. Alice needs to move closer to the blue cube to be in position for sweeping. She should execute a MOVE blue_cube action.\n2. Bob is already relatively close to the blue cube, but to ensure proper positioning for sweeping, he should also execute a MOVE blue_cube action.\n3. In the next round, Alice will need to WAIT while Bob SWEEPs the blue cube into the dustpan.\n4. Finally, Alice will DUMP the blue cube into the trash bin.\n\n```reasoning\nAlice and Bob have successfully swept the green and red cubes into the trash bin.
