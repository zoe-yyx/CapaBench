Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

        "message": "Based on the scene description and the abstract plan provided, I'll reason about the current situation and the next steps for Alice and Bob to efficiently complete their task.\n\n1. The first subtask is to sweep up the green cube into the trash bin.\n2. The green cube is currently at (0.2, 0.5, 0.2) on the table.\n3. Alice is closest to the green cube (distance: 0.44), while Bob is furthest (distance: 1.00).\n4. According to the abstract plan, both robots need to MOVE to the green cube first.\n\nLet's plan the next few steps:\n\nStep 1:\nAlice: MOVE green_cube\nBob: MOVE green_cube\n\nReasoning: Both robots need to position themselves near the green cube to prepare for sweeping. Alice is already closer, but still needs to adjust her position. Bob needs to move a greater distance.\n\nStep 2:\nAlice: WAIT\nBob: SWEEP green_cube\n\nReasoning: Once both robots are in position, Alice needs to WAIT with the dustpan ready while Bob performs the SWEEP action to push the green cube into the dustpan.\n\nStep 3:\nAlice: DUMP\nBob: WAIT\n\nReasoning: After the green cube is in the dustpan, Alice needs to DUMP it into the trash bin while Bob waits.\n\nThis completes the first subtask of sweeping up the green cube. The next steps would involve moving to the red cube, which is the second subtask according to the required order.\n\n```reasoning\nThe current focus is on sweeping up the green cube, which is the first subtask. Both robots need to move to the green cube initially. Alice, being closer, will likely reach it first. Once both are in position, Alice will wait with the dustpan while Bob sweeps the cube. Finally, Alice will dump the cube in the trash bin. This completes the first part of the task, after which they will move on to the red cube.\n```"
