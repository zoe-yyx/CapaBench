Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

Now, we need to move on to the second subtask, which is to sweep up the red cube into the trash bin. Let's plan the next few steps:\n\n1. Both Alice and Bob need to move to the red cube.\n2. Alice needs to position the dustpan while Bob sweeps the red cube.\n3. Alice will then dump the red cube into the trash bin.\n\nLet's reason through these steps:\n\n1. Alice MOVE red_cube: Alice is currently closer to the red cube (distance 0.68) compared to the blue cube (distance 0.87). Moving to the red cube aligns with our next subtask.\n\n2. Bob MOVE red_cube: Bob is also closer to the red cube (distance 0.70) compared to the blue cube (distance 0.85). Both robots need to be at the red cube for the sweeping action.\n\n3. Alice WAIT: Once both robots are at the red cube, Alice needs to position the dustpan and wait for Bob to sweep.\n\n4. Bob SWEEP red_cube: With Alice in position, Bob can sweep the red cube into the dustpan.\n\n5. Alice DUMP: After the red cube is in the dustpan, Alice can dump it into the trash bin.\n\nThis plan covers the next subtask efficiently and follows the required order of operations.\n\n```reasoning\nThe green cube has been swept into the trash bin.
