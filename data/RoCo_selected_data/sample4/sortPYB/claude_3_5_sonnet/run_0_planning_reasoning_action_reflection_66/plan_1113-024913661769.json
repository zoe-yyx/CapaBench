They form a straight assembly line, panel1 is closed to panel2 and farthest from panel7.\nThere are 3 cubes, each robot must place their cube on the correct target, their (cube, target_panel) pairs: \nAlice: (pink_polygon, panel2), \nBob: (yellow_trapezoid, panel4), \nChad: (blue_square, panel6).\nThere are 3 robots, each with a limited reach range, this means they can only pick cubes from these panels, and can only place cubes on these panels. The (robot, [reachable_panels]) pairs: \n(Alice, [panel1, panel2, panel3])\n(Bob, [panel3, panel4, panel5])\n(Chad, [panel5, panel6, panel7])\n\n\n[Action Options]\n1) PICK <object name> PLACE <location>\n2) WAIT\nOnly PICK an object if your gripper is empty.

Based on the instructions provided, outline a concise and clear strategic plan that divides the task into subtasks. Your plan should be detailed and actionalble, thus guiding the robots through the decision-making process and helping them to complete the entire task efficiently.\nAfter your thinking, you should output your plan like\n```plan\nPut your plan here\n```\nYour thinking and your plan are:\n"

        "message": "Thank you for providing the detailed scenario. I'll outline a strategic plan for the robots to efficiently complete their task. Here's my thinking process:\n\n1. Each robot needs to place their assigned cube on their target panel.\n2. Some cubes are not within reach of their assigned robot, so we need to coordinate movements.\n3. We should minimize the number of moves and avoid unnecessary handoffs.\n4. The order of operations is important to prevent blocking or inefficient movements.\n\nBased on this, here's the plan:\n\n```plan\n1. Bob PICK yellow_trapezoid from panel3 and PLACE on panel4 (target)\n2. Chad PICK blue_square from panel5 and PLACE on panel6 (target)\n3. Chad PICK pink_polygon from panel7 and PLACE on panel5\n4. Bob PICK pink_polygon from panel5 and PLACE on panel3\n5. Alice PICK pink_polygon from panel3 and PLACE on panel2 (target)\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that:\n1. Each robot only handles cubes within their reach.\n2. The cubes are moved efficiently to their target panels.\n3. Intermediate steps (moving pink_polygon) are used when necessary.\n4. The order of operations prevents any potential blocking or conflicts.\n\nBy following this plan, all three robots will successfully place their assigned cubes on the correct target panels with minimal moves and efficient collaboration."
