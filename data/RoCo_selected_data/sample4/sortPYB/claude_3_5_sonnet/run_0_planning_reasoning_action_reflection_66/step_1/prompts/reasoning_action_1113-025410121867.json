While WAIT is a valid action, having all robots WAIT simultaneously does not contribute to moving the cubes to their target positions. At least one robot should be taking an action to pick or place a cube if possible.\nAn abstract plan on how to complete the task is 1. Bob PICK yellow_trapezoid from panel3 and PLACE on panel4 (target)\n2. Chad PICK blue_square from panel5 and PLACE on panel6 (target)\n3. Chad PICK pink_polygon from panel7 and PLACE on panel5\n4. Bob PICK pink_polygon from panel5 and PLACE on panel3\n5. Alice PICK pink_polygon from panel3 and PLACE on panel2 (target)\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

Yellow_trapezoid is already in its target position (panel4), so Bob doesn't need to move it.\n2. Blue_square is in panel6, which is its target position, so Chad doesn't need to move it.\n3. Pink_polygon is in panel7, which is out of Alice's reach. We need to move it to panel2.\n\nLet's plan the steps:\n\n1. Chad should pick up the pink_polygon from panel7 and place it on panel5, which is within Bob's reach.\n2. Bob can then pick up the pink_polygon from panel5 and place it on panel3, which is within Alice's reach.\n3. Finally, Alice can pick up the pink_polygon from panel3 and place it on its target, panel2.\n\nNow, let's reason about the immediate actions:\n\n- Alice: Cannot reach any cubes, so she should WAIT.\n- Bob: Has nothing to do with the yellow_trapezoid, so he should WAIT.\n- Chad: Can reach the pink_polygon and should move it to panel5.\n\nFor the next step:\nChad will have moved the pink_polygon to panel5, so Bob will be able to act.\n\n```reasoning\nIn the current step, Chad should move the pink_polygon from panel7 to panel5, while Alice and Bob wait.
