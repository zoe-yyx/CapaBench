Bob PICK yellow_trapezoid from panel3 and PLACE on panel4 (target)\n2. Chad PICK blue_square from panel5 and PLACE on panel6 (target)\n3. Chad PICK pink_polygon from panel7 and PLACE on panel5\n4. Bob PICK pink_polygon from panel5 and PLACE on panel3\n5. Alice PICK pink_polygon from panel3 and PLACE on panel2 (target)\n\nThe abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!\nAfter your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like\n```reasoning\nPut your reasoning summary here\n```\nYour thinking and your reasoning are:"

Current state:\n   - yellow_trapezoid is already in panel4 (its target)\n   - blue_square is in panel6 (its target)\n   - pink_polygon is on panel5 (needs to be moved to panel2)\n\n2. Next steps:\n   a. Chad can reach pink_polygon on panel5, so Chad should move it to a panel that Bob can reach.\n   b. Bob can then move the pink_polygon to a panel that Alice can reach.\n   c. Finally, Alice can place the pink_polygon on its target (panel2).\n\n3. Detailed plan:\n   Step 1: Chad PICK pink_polygon from panel5 and PLACE on panel5 (Chad can't reach panel3 directly)\n   Step 2: Bob PICK pink_polygon from panel5 and PLACE on panel3\n   Step 3: Alice PICK pink_polygon from panel3 and PLACE on panel2 (target)\n\n4. Future considerations:\n   - After these steps, all cubes will be in their correct positions, completing the task.\n\n```reasoning\nThe task is partially complete with yellow_trapezoid and blue_square already in their target positions. The remaining objective is to move pink_polygon from panel5 to panel2. This requires coordination between Chad, Bob, and Alice due to their limited reach ranges. Chad should first move pink_polygon within Bob's reach, then Bob should move it within Alice's reach, and finally Alice can place it on the target panel. This plan efficiently utilizes all robots to complete the task in the minimum number of steps.\n```"
