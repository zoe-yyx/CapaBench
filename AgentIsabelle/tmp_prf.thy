(* Troubleshooting the Isabelle environment *)
(* Check file permissions for the Isabelle database *)
(* Ensure there's sufficient disk space *)
(* Verify that no other processes are locking the database *)
(* Consider a clean reinstallation of Isabelle if the issues persist *)
(* Start with a minimal working example before attempting the full proof *)
(* Keep a record of the steps taken to resolve the issue *)
