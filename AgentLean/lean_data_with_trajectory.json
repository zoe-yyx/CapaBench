We are provided with a series of inequalities and an equation that relate the number of male and female teachers (MT, FT) and male and female children (MC, FC).\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to approach the proof:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information**: Review the hypotheses to understand the relationships between MT, FT, MC, and FC.\n2. **Simplify the Equation**: Use the equation `h5 : MT + FT + MC + FC = 16` to express one variable in terms of the others, if possible.\n3. **Analyze the Inequalities**: Use the inequalities `h6 : MC + FC > MT + FT`, `h7 : FT > FC`, `h8 : FC > MC`, and `h9 : MC > MT` to derive further relations or constraints on the variables.\n4. **Isolate MT**: Try to manipulate the equation and inequalities to isolate MT on one side.\n5. **Use Linear Arithmetic Tactics**: Given that we've imported `Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith`, use this tactic to simplify and solve any linear arithmetic expressions involving the variables.\n6. **Consider the Hypotheses**: Make sure to use `h1 : 0 < MT`, `h2 : 0 < FT`, `h3 : 0 < MC`, and `h4 : 0 < FC` to ensure that all variables are positive integers, which will help in finding the exact value of MT.\n7. **Look for Patterns or Special Cases**: Given the constraints, there might be a limited number of integer solutions. Check if any pattern emerges or if we can find a special case that satisfies all conditions.\n8. **Direct Proof or Contradiction**: Depending on the progress, either prove directly that MT = 1 or assume the opposite and derive a contradiction using the given conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to construct a proof for the theorem `teachers_and_children`.\n",
                "reasoning": "\nBased on the planning strategy outlined, the acting agent should first focus on simplifying the equation `h5 : MT + FT + MC + FC = 16` to express one of the variables in terms of the others. Since the goal is to isolate `MT`, it would be beneficial to express `FT`, `MC`, and `FC` in terms of `MT` using the other inequalities and the fact that all variables are positive integers (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`). \n\nThe inequalities `h6 : MC + FC > MT + FT`, `h7 : FT > FC`, `h8 : FC > MC`, and `h9 : MC > MT` provide a framework for understanding the relative sizes of the variables. The acting agent should use these to deduce further constraints on the possible values of `MT`, `FT`, `MC`, and `FC`.\n\nGiven that `FT > FC` and `FC > MC`, and also `MC > MT`, it follows that `FT > FC > MC > MT`. This ordering, combined with the fact that their sum is 16, suggests that `MT` must be the smallest number in this group. Since all numbers are positive, the smallest possible value for `MT` that maintains the inequality `MC > MT` is 1 (as `MT` cannot be 0 due to `h1`).\n\nTo confirm that `MT` is indeed 1, the acting agent can use the `linarith` tactic on the inequalities and the equation to find a contradiction if `MT` were greater than 1. If no contradiction is found when assuming `MT = 1`, then this would be a step towards proving the theorem. The agent should proceed with this reasoning to guide the next steps in the proof.\n",

However, given the straightforward nature of this proof, we can also use direct computation to reach the result.\n\n5. **Final Proof Construction**: The entire proof can be accomplished in a single step by:\n   - Applying `rfl` (reflexivity) after confirming both sides of the equation are equal.\n   - Alternatively, using `linarith` if we set up the expressions correctly.\n\n6. **Proof Steps in Lean**:\n   - Start the proof using `by` notation.\n   - Compute the result of `plus_one (plus_one 1)` directly.\n   - Conclude with `rfl` for reflexivity.\n\n7. **Write the Lean Code**: The final step is to implement this in Lean code as follows:\n   - Start the proof.\n   - Carry out the computations.\n   - Conclude with the reflexivity tactic.\n\n8. **Final Thoughts**: The problem is straightforward, so we will not require complex strategic maneuvers or justification for advanced tactics.\n\n",

Using `linarith` will directly compare and verify the arithmetic relationship without further transformation or simplification of terms, which coincides with our planned approach to exploit arithmetic strategies.\n\nThus, the next step would be trying the `linarith` tactic to finalize the proof as it is strictly a linear arithmetic expression now, which aligns well with the capabilities of `linarith`.\n",

Analyze the provided theorem (mono_compose):\n   - The theorem claims that if two integer-to-integer functions `f` and `g` are both monotonous (i.e., 'mono f' and 'mono g' are true), then their composition (`Zcomp f g`) is also monotonous.\n\n3. Plan the Proof Strategy:\n   - Assumptions:\n     a. Assume `f` and `g` are monotonous, i.e., `mono f` and `mono g`.\n   - Goal: Prove `mono (Zcomp f g)`.\n   \n4. Detailed Steps in Proof:\n   - Begin by assuming two arbitrary integers `n` and `m` such that `n \u2264 m`.\n   - Using the assumption of `mono g`, derive that `g n \u2264 g m`.\n   - Applying the `mono f` assumption on `g n` and `g m`,\n       conclude `f (g n) \u2264 f (g m)`.\n   - By definition of Zcomp, `Zcomp f g n = f (g n)` and similarly `Zcomp f g m = f (g m)`, interrelate the results to conclude `Zcomp f g n \u2264 Zcomp f g m`.\n   - By the definition of monotonous functions, infer that `Zcomp f g` is monotonous.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The theorem\u2019s claim should follow from the chained implications rooted in the assumptions of the monotonicity of `f` and `g`.\n\nBy linking the implications from the monotonic properties of `f` and `g` through integers' ordering, you effectively apply the properties of function composition and ordered relations to manifest the result desired. The theorem is crucially upheld by the basic understanding of monotonicity and how function composition respects that property under the given conditions.\n",

The reasoning suggests beginning by introducing the assumptions about `f` and `g` being monotonic functions. These assumptions are essential because they are the foundational hypotheses from which the conclusion of the composed function's monotonicity is derived. \n\nYou will first need to use the assumption of the proof, `assume hf : mono f` and `assume hg : mono g`, and begin reasoning that for arbitrary integers `n` and `m`, where `n \u2264 m`. You need to prove that `f (g n) \u2264 f (g m)`, indirectly by using the provided assumptions `hf` and `hg`.\n\nAfterwards, the application of `mono g` would provide that `g n \u2264 g m`, and by applying `mono f` subsequently, it should allow you to deduce `f (g n) \u2264 f (g m)`. Reflecting this reasoning back to the definition of `Zcomp` and the property of being monotonic will allow you to conclude that `Zcomp f g` is also monotonic.

Given the nature of integer multiplication and from general arithmetic principles, it's known that multiplication is associative. \n\nThe plan suggests starting with the introduction of arbitrary integers `x`, `y`, and `z`. This step is fundamental as it allows us to move from the general statement about associativity to specific instances which can then be examined or simplified. By introducing these specific but arbitrary integers, it sets the stage for using basic arithmetic properties and possibly applying the `ring` tactic to simplify and prove the required equality of the two expressions.\n\nBased on historical actions, there have been no steps taken yet, so the immediate action should be introducing `x`, `y`, and `z` using the `intro` tactic.

This direct approach is in line with the strategy to rely on the inherent associativity of multiplication without needing to unfold additional properties or complexities.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning behind the next action steps involves recognizing the associative property inherently present in integer multiplication, setting up the variables, and proceeding towards simplifying the algebraic expressions to demonstrate the equality, making use of Lean's `ring` tactic if necessary.

                "reasoning": "\nTo address the failure of the `linarith` tactic in concluding the inequality `shift_up1 f n \u2264 shift_up1 f m`, we need to ensure that our reasoning is both clear and properly structured.\n\n1. **Reiterate Key Definitions**:\n   - We have `shift_up1 f n = f n + 1` and `shift_up1 f m = f m + 1`. Thus, we need to show that if `n \u2264 m`, then it follows that `f n + 1 \u2264 f m + 1`.\n\n2. **Use Known Inequalities**:\n   - Since we have `hf : f n \u2264 f m` from our assumption of monotonicity given by `h`, we can indeed assert that `f n + 1 \u2264 f m + 1` directly derives from this.\n\n3. **Explicitly State the Transformation**:\n   - We should rewrite the proof to explicitly show the transformation from `f n \u2264 f m` to `f n + 1 \u2264 f m + 1`. This can be done as follows:\n     - Starting with `f n \u2264 f m` (which is our `hf`), we add 1 to both sides: `f n + 1 \u2264 f m + 1`.\n     - This step should be clearly indicated as relying on the monotonic behavior of arithmetic operations (adding the same quantity to both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality).\n\n4. **Revising the Proof Steps**:\n   - Update the proof to include this clear transformation. For instance, you could introduce an explicit statement revealing the transition from `hf : f n \u2264 f m` to `f n + 1 \u2264 f m + 1` before calling `linarith`.\n\nSo, the acting agent should modify the proof as follows:\n",

By showing the inequality \\( f(n+1) \\leq f(m+1) \\) holds under the assumption \\( n \\leq m \\), we can effectively conclude that `shift_left1 f` maintains the monotonicity of \\( f \\).\n\nEach of these critical steps requires specific Lean 4 tactics:\n- Initially, use `intros f hf` to introduce the function \\( f \\) and assume it is monotone (denoted by \\( hf \\)).\n- Continue with `intros n m hnm` to take arbitrary integers \\( n \\), \\( m \\) and their relation \\( n \\leq m \\).\n- Apply the assumed monotonicity `hf` to derive \\( f(n+1) \\leq f(m+1) \\) from \\( n+1 \\leq m+1 \\), reusing the assumption \\( hnm \\) and potentially employing tactics like `apply` or direct relational reasoning.\n\nThis stepwise logical deduction ensures that we maintain clarity and correctness in proving that shifting a monotone function to the left results in another monotone function.\n",

This can be done using Lean's `intro` tactic for the function `f` and an appropriate hypothesis to state that `mono f` is true.\n\n2. Next, introduce two integers `n` and `m` that satisfy the condition `n \u2264 m`. This will involve introducing the respective variables and stating the relevant hypothesis.\n\n3.

Since we have that `n \u2264 m`, you will prove that `n + 1 \u2264 m + 1` using Lean\u2019s tactics.

Utilize `simp` for simplifying expressions according to definitions.\n   - Be ready to justify every algebraic manipulation with regard to properties of integers and functions in Lean 4.\n\nThis structured approach ensures a logical progression through the proof and leverages fundamental Lean 4 tactics efficiently.\n",
                "reasoning": "\nTo guide the next step of proof effectively, consider employing the 'funext' tactic as initially outlined in the planned strategy. This tactic aims to establish the equality of two functions by showing they agree on every input. Once 'funext' is successfully applied, focus on proving the pointwise equivalence of `shift_up1 f x` to `(func_plus f (fun _ => 1)) x` for any integer `x`. Begin by expanding both sides based on their definitions. This endeavor should demonstrate that each side simplifies down to `f x + 1`, therefore making the expressions equal for arbitrary `x`. This tactic adheres strictly to the guiding principle of functional extensionality and prepares the pavement for asserting the overall function equality. \n",

Begin by understanding the definitions:\n   - `shift_up1` takes a function `f` from integers to integers and an integer `x`, and returns `f(x) + 1`.\n   - `func_plus` takes two functions `f` and `g` from integers to integers and an integer `x`, and returns `f(x) + g(x)`.\n\n2. The theorem to be proved is that `shift_up1 f` is equal to `func_plus f (fun _ => 1)` for any function `f` from integers to integers.\n\n3. To prove this, we can start by expanding the definition of `shift_up1` on the left-hand side of the equation:\n   - `shift_up1 f = f(x) + 1` for any integer `x`.\n\n4. Next, expand the definition of `func_plus` on the right-hand side of the equation:\n   - `func_plus f (fun _ => 1) = f(x) + (fun _ => 1) x` for any integer `x`.\n   - Since `(fun _ => 1) x` is simply `1`, this simplifies to `f(x) + 1`.\n\n5. Now, we have both sides of the equation expanded and simplified to `f(x) + 1`. We can use the equality of these expressions to prove the theorem.\n\n6. The proof will likely involve rfl ( reflexivity tactic), which closes a goal when the term to be proved is equal to the term in the current hypothesis or context.\n\n7. Given that Lean 4's type system should ensure that the functions are well-formed, and the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus` align correctly, the proof should be straightforward.\n\nProof outline:\n",

The theorem `shift_up1_eq` should be proved by unfolding the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus` and then demonstrating that the resulting expressions are definitionally equal.

Unfold the definitions of `shift_up1` and `func_plus`.\n2.

Identify the key components:\n   - The theorem statement: treeHeight leaf = 0\n   - The relevant part of the treeHeight function: | leaf => 0\n\n4. Outline the proof strategy:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side of the equation: treeHeight leaf\n   b. Apply the definition of treeHeight for the leaf case\n   c. Simplify the result to obtain the right-hand side: 0\n\n5. Plan the tactical approach:\n   a. Use 'rfl' (reflexivity) tactic, which should automatically unfold the definition and prove the equality.\n   b. If 'rfl' doesn't work, consider using 'unfold treeHeight' to explicitly expand the definition, then apply 'rfl'.\n\n6.

The treeHeight function is defined explicitly for the leaf case to return 0.\n2. The theorem statement exactly matches this definition.\n3.

This makes the proof quite straightforward, essentially reducing to an affirmation of what is explicitly stated in the function definition.

Understand the Tree and Function Definitions:\n   - Tree is defined inductively with two constructors: `leaf` which represents an empty tree and `node` which represents a tree node with a left child tree `l`, an integer value `v`, and a right child tree `r`.\n   - The `treeHeight` function is recursively defined to compute the height of a tree. For a leaf, the height is 0. For a node, it computes the maximum of the heights of its left and right subtrees and adds 1.\n   - The `myMax` function compares two integers and returns the larger of the two.\n\n2. Review the specific Tree Instance:\n   - `treeExample2a` is defined as `node (node leaf 8 leaf) 100 (node leaf 9 leaf)`.\n     - This describes a tree where the root node has value 100, the left child is a node with value 8 and leaf children, and the right child is a node with value 9 and leaf children.\n   \n3. Calculate the Expected Tree Height:\n   - Start from the root: It\u2019s a `node` with two sub-trees, so apply the definition of `treeHeight`.\n   - The left subtree `node leaf 8 leaf`:\n     - Leaves have height 0.\n     - Applying `treeHeight`, height becomes `myMax(0, 0) + 1 = 1`.\n   - The right subtree `node leaf 9 leaf`:\n     - Similarly, height is `myMax(0, 0) + 1 = 1`.\n   - Back to the root:\n     - Height becomes `myMax(1, 1) + 1 = 2`.\n\n4. Decompose the Problem:\n   - We need to establish that `treeHeight treeExample2a` computes to exactly 2 using the recursive property and the definitions provided.\n\n5. Developing the Proof Strategy for the Target Theorem `treeExample2aHeight`:\n   - Begin by using the `treeHeight` and `myMax` definitions to compute `treeHeight` for both left and right subtrees of `treeExample2a`.\n   - Substitute the values obtained into the `treeHeight` definition for the root.\n   - Justify each step using the recursion base case for leaves and the recursive definition for nodes.\n   - Finally, confirm the root's height calculation matches the required value.\n\n6. Start Lean 4 coding for the theorem:\n   - Use matched `treeHeight` definitions to simplify terms.\n   - Use `myMax` to resolve the maximum values for left and right subtrees.\n   - Conclude and confirm the height equals 2.\n\nBy systematically applying these steps and using Lean 4 functionalities, you should be able to prove the theorem effectively.\n",

We need to address the problem with the correct use of the Lean 4 'rw' tactic for rewriting, aiming to simplify the expressions and ensure the calculations correctly reflect the recursive tree height definitions.\n\nTo resolve the error and continue the proof:\n1. Correct the structural decomposition in the proof where 'cases treeExample2a;' splits the structure. Instead, directly calculate based on the specific structure of 'treeExample2a' which is known.\n2. Replace detailed calculations involving internal nodes with direct evaluations respecting the recursive structure as defined by the 'treeHeight' function.\n3. Use the 'rw' tactic for the 'treeHeight' leaf cases to simplify to 0 immediately. For the node cases, it\u2019s necessary to unfold the application of 'myMax' accurately reflecting its definition in each recursive step.\n4. After each 'rw' step that unfolds a recursive level, ensure that calculations correctly step through the application of 'myMax' and correctly simplify the expressions at each stage of recursion.\n5. Aim toward simplifying the entire expression step-by-step to reach the conclusion that 'treeHeight treeExample2a = 2' as expected from our earlier reasoning plan.\n\nBy amending these steps, we align the proof better with the planned structural and functional aspects of the Tree hierarchy and correctly use Lean 4's capabilities to manipulate and compute the expressional values effectively.\n",

Focus on the leaf case:\n   - The theorem specifically deals with the leaf case of treeReverse.\n\n4. Proving strategy:\n   a. Start with the left-hand side of the equation: treeReverse leaf\n   b. Apply the definition of treeReverse for the leaf case\n   c. Show that this results in leaf (the right-hand side of the equation)\n\n5. Expected steps in the proof:\n   a. Unfold the definition of treeReverse\n   b. Simplify the expression\n   c. Verify that the result matches the right-hand side of the equation\n\n6. Tactics to consider:\n   - rfl (reflexivity) might be sufficient for this simple case\n   - If needed, use simp to simplify expressions\n\n7.

Therefore, treeReverse leaf evaluates to leaf.\n\n4. The right-hand side of the equation is also leaf.\n\n5. Since both sides of the equation evaluate to the same term (leaf), the equality holds.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the proof should be trivial and can likely be completed in a single step using the rfl (reflexivity) tactic. The rfl tactic is used when the left and right sides of an equation are definitionally equal, which is the case here.\n\nSuggested next action for the acting agent:\nUse the rfl tactic to complete the proof.

Target Theorem: `leafTreeReverse`\n   - The theorem states that reversing a `leaf` should result in a `leaf`.\n\n4. Proving Strategy:\n   - Directly Look at the Definition of `treeReverse` function:\n     - When `treeReverse` function is applied to `leaf`, by definition, it immediately returns `leaf`.\n   \n   - Application of Equational Reasoning:\n     - Since `treeReverse leaf` is defined explicitly to be `leaf` within the function definition, the proof is straightforward and follows directly from the function definition.\n\n5. Steps to Prove `leafTreeReverse`:\n   - Use the definition of `treeReverse`.\n   - Show that when the input is `leaf`, the output is also `leaf` through simple substitution based on the function definition.\n   \n6.

The strategy involves using equational reasoning where the left-hand side of our equation in the theorem (treeReverse leaf) is substituted directly by the right-hand side (leaf) using the explicit definition given in the function treeReverse. This is a straightforward substitution based on the function's definition without the need for auxiliary lemmas or complicated tactics, constituting a direct application of the information provided by the definition of `treeReverse`.

This is straightforward, as it directly follows from the function definition.\n   - **Inductive case**: For the `node` case, we need to show that:\n     - `treeReverse (node leaf 1 leaf) = node (treeReverse leaf) 1 (treeReverse leaf)`\n     - Since `treeReverse leaf = leaf`, it simplifies to `node leaf 1 leaf`.\n\n5. **Construct the Proof**:\n   - Start by showing the equality holds for the base case.\n   - Then demonstrate that for `treeExample0`, the result holds true through the calculation and simplification using the known values.\n   - Finally, explicitly conclude the proof using Lean 4 syntax.\n\n6. **Consider using 'sorry'**:\n   - If needed, we can introduce a `sorry` statement to bypass the proof process for the base case if it becomes cumbersome. However, the proof for this specific theorem is straightforward and doesn't require skipping.\n\n7. **Final Thought**:\n   - The proof revolves around understanding the structure of the tree and utilizing the properties of the `treeReverse` function to show it maintains the tree's original form.\n\nIn summary, the proof can be carried out by leveraging the obvious symmetry in the tree structure and following through the recursive definition provided in `treeReverse`.\n",

Therefore, swapping these leaf nodes will not change the structure of the tree. We should then be able to directly equate the resulting expression with `treeExample0` to complete the proof.

For instance:\n- We can start from the leaves of `treeExample3a` and `treeExample3b`, apply `treeReverse` to these, and ascertain that the leaves themselves trivially satisfy the reversal property (since reversing a leaf yields a leaf).\n- Progress upwards to nodes higher in the tree hierarchy, checking after each step that the subtree formed matches the corresponding subtree in `treeExample3b` when reversed. \n- This includes verifying that the values at each node remain constant while the left and right subtrees are swapped correctly.\n\nIt may also be beneficial to structurally prove simpler properties or even lemmas about `treeReverse` that assert certain behaviours on smaller or simpler tree structures and then use these lemmas within the larger proof. This could provide a clearer pathway and structural groundwork facilitating the larger proof by induction on the structure of the tree, using recursive application of `treeReverse`.\n",

Specifically, decompose the equality of the two `node` constructions into the equality of their individual components (`l1 = l2`, `v1 = v2`, `r1 = r2`).\n     - We focus on proving `l1 = l2` as specified in the theorem, potentially assuming the other equalities (`v1 = v2`, `r1 = r2`) which might already be implied by the hypothesis.\n\n4. **Lean Techniques and Tactics to be Applied:**\n   - **`cases` Tactic:** Apply the `cases` tactic to handle any encapsulated constructs and focus directly on the underlying values.\n   - **`simp` or `exact`:** Use `simp` to simplify any equality checks automatically by Lean, or use `exact` when direct application of the hypothesis solves the goal.\n   - **`by_cases` or `by_contradiction`:** Although not necessarily required here, these tactics can be useful if proving by direct equality is insufficient and a contradiction approach is needed.\n\n5. **Refine Strategy Based on Lean\u2019s Feedback:**\n   - As we proceed with the proof, Lean's type checker and error messages will guide further refinement.\n   - Adjust the use of tactics based on the sub-goals generated and solve each until the main goal is achieved.\n\n6. **Final Verification:**\n   - Upon completing the proof, double-check for any logical oversights or missed edge cases by reviewing the proof as a whole.\n   - Ensure that the proof aligns strictly with the rules and capabilities provided by Lean 4 and utilizes the efficient proving techniques.\n\nBy following this plan, we specifically address the requirements of the `nodeInjLeft` theorem and employ a systematic approach to navigating Lean's proof environment effectively.\n",

After introducing the hypothesis, we should use the injection tactic. This tactic is crucial because it will break down the equality of the 'node' constructors into equalities of their components (left subtrees, values, and right subtrees).\n\n3. The injection tactic will generate three separate equalities: one for the left subtrees (l1 = l2), one for the values (v1 = v2), and one for the right subtrees (r1 = r2).\n\n4. Among these generated equalities, we're particularly interested in the equality of the right subtrees (r1 = r2), as this is exactly what we need to prove for our theorem.\n\n5.

In Lean, equality of inductive data types implies that all their corresponding components are equal.\n   - Once you've matched the nodes, you have `l1 = l2`, `v1 = v2`, and crucially for our proof, `r1 = r2` directly as part of the equality condition due to the structure of the `node`.\n   - Assert these equalities to simplify the proof and focus on concluding `r1 = r2`.\n\n5.

Given the definition of `node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2`, Lean's handling of inductive types allows us to conclude that if two `node` structures are equal, then each of their corresponding components (left subtree, value, and right subtree) must also be equal. Therefore, not only are `l1` and `l2` identical, `v1` and `v2` identical, but most importantly for our goal, `r1` and `r2` must be identical as well. This direct extraction of equality of right subtrees from the nodes' equality is central to proving the theorem.\n\nTo implement this reasoning, next, the acting agent should use the tactic `cases` or `match` on the equality hypothesis of the nodes. This will split the equality of the entire node structures into separate equalities of their components. Subsequently focusing on the equality of `r1` and `r2` will then be straightforward because it would have been established inherently as part of the decomposition of the nodes' equality. The final step will be to assert this equality of right subtrees (using either `exact` or `assumption` tactic), thus completing the proof.\n",

The structure of the `Tree` inductive type provides us with the necessary tools to reason about equality between nodes.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **Understand the Equality**: Recall that in Lean, the equality of two nodes `node l1 v1 r1` and `node l2 v2 r2` means that all corresponding parts of these nodes must be equal. This includes the left subtree (`l1` and `l2`), the value (`v1` and `v2`), and the right subtree (`r1` and `r2`).\n\n2. **Use Induction on Equality**: Since we are dealing with equality, we can use the principle of equality induction. However, in this case, it's more straightforward to directly apply the definition of equality for the `node` constructor.\n\n3. **Direct Proof**:\n   - Assume `node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2`.\n   - By the definition of equality for the `node` constructor, this implies `l1 = l2`, `v1 = v2`, and `r1 = r2`.\n   - We are interested in showing `r1 = r2`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: From the assumption and the definition of equality for the `node` constructor, we directly get `r1 = r2`.\n\n### Steps to Implement:\n- Start the proof with `intro h`, where `h` is the hypothesis `node l1 v1 r1 = node l2 v2 r2`.\n- Use the `cases h` tactic to break down the equality into its components.\n- Extract the equality `r1 = r2` from the cases.\n\nThis plan should guide the player through the steps needed to prove the theorem `nodeInjRight` in Lean 4.\n",

Therefore, by applying `cases h`, we will obtain the individual equalities `l1 = l2`, `v1 = v2`, and `r1 = r2`. Our goal is to extract `r1 = r2` from this decomposition.\n\nThus, the next step should be to introduce the hypothesis and then immediately apply the `cases` tactic to it.\n",

Hence, `t` must be some `node l v r`. According to the definition of `treeReverse`, this implies `treeReverse t = node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l)`.\n   - Since `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l)` cannot be `leaf` (wrong constructor), this contradicts our assumption that `treeReverse t = leaf`.\n   - Thus, `t` must be `leaf`.\n\n5. **Implement The Proof In Lean:**\n   - Invoke `cases t` to consider the cases `leaf` and `node` separately.\n   - The case where `t` is `leaf` is trivial as both `treeReverse t` and `t` are `leaf`.\n   - For `t` equals `node l v r`, derive a contradiction from `treeReverse t = leaf` and remove it via contradiction (`case node`).\n   - Conclude that `t` must equal `leaf`.\n\n6. **Reflect on the Proof:**\n   - The proof utilizes type matching on `Tree` and simple logical reasoning.\n   - By refuting the possibility of non-leaf trees transforming into a leaf by reversing, we stay aligned with the definition of the `treeReverse` function.\n\nBy following this plan, you get a structured and logical approach to providing a proof for the theorem `reverseResultLeaf` in Lean 4.\n",

Since `cases t` will allow us to split our proof into cases where `t` is either a `leaf` or a `node l v r`, we should proceed with this operation. \n2. For the case where `treeReverse` of `t` being `leaf`:\n    - If `t` is `leaf`, the theorem is trivially true because `treeReverse leaf = leaf`.\n    - If `t` is `node l v r`, according to the `treeReverse` function, `treeReverse t` results in `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l)`. From the hypothesis `treeReverse t = leaf`, derive that node cannot be a leaf because it does not match the leaf constructor. This leads to a contradiction since a `node` cannot be equal to a `leaf`.\n3. Hence, the `node` case can be eliminated through contradiction, leaving the conclusion that `t` must be `leaf`.\n\nThis breakdown provides a logical trail leading to the necessary contradiction and is designed to guide the agent through their next actions, affirming the correctness of handling each case as per inductive definitions.\n",

This involves understanding the structure of the `Tree` type and the behavior of the `treeReverse` function.\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of `Tree`:**\n   - A `Tree` can either be a `leaf` or a `node` with a left subtree (`l`), an integer value (`v`), and a right subtree (`r`).\n\n2. **Analyze the `treeReverse` Function:**\n   - The `treeReverse` function recursively reverses the structure of a tree. If the input is a `leaf`, it returns `leaf`. If the input is a `node`, it constructs a new `node` with the reversed subtrees.\n\n3. **Proof Strategy:**\n   - We will use induction on the structure of the tree `t`.\n   - Base Case: If `t` is `leaf`, then `treeReverse t` is `leaf`, which satisfies the condition.\n   - Inductive Step: Assume `t` is a `node l v r`. We need to show that if `treeReverse (node l v r)` equals `leaf`, then `node l v r` must be `leaf`. However, since `treeReverse (node l v r)` results in `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l)`, it cannot be `leaf` unless both `l` and `r` are `leaf`. Therefore, the only way for `treeReverse (node l v r)` to be `leaf` is if `l` and `r` are both `leaf`, making `node l v r` equivalent to `leaf`.\n\n4. **Formal Proof Steps:**\n   - Use `induction` tactic on `t`.\n   - For the base case, directly show that `treeReverse leaf` is `leaf`.\n   - For the inductive step, assume `treeReverse (node l v r)` is `leaf` and derive a contradiction unless `l` and `r` are both `leaf`.\n\nBy following these steps, we can construct a formal proof for the theorem `reverseResultLeaf`.\n",

This tactic will allow us to handle the two cases defined by the `Tree` inductive type: when `t` is a `leaf` and when `t` is a `node`.\n\nFor the base case where `t` is `leaf`, we need to show that if `treeReverse leaf` equals `leaf`, then `leaf` equals `leaf`. This is trivially true because `treeReverse leaf` is defined as `leaf`.\n\nFor the inductive step, we assume `t` is a `node l v r`. Here, we need to show that if `treeReverse (node l v r)` equals `leaf`, then `node l v r` must be `leaf`. By the definition of `treeReverse`, `treeReverse (node l v r)` is `node (treeReverse r) v (treeReverse l)`. For this to equal `leaf`, both `treeReverse r` and `treeReverse l` must be `leaf`. According to our theorem, this implies that both `r` and `l` must be `leaf`. Hence, `node l v r` would be equivalent to `leaf`.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to apply the `induction` tactic to start the proof.\n",

This means we can reformulate the statement to indirectly prove `\u00ac Q a \u2192 \u00ac P a`.\n   - We will assume `x : A` is arbitrary.\n\n4. **Steps to Proceed**:\n   - Start the proof by introducing `x` and assuming `\u00ac Q x`.\n   - We need to show `\u00ac P x`.\n   - To do this, we will assume for contradiction `P x` holds.\n   - From this assumption, we can use the initial premise `(\u2200 a : A, P a \u2192 Q a)` and instantiate it with `x`, leading us to `Q x`.\n   - Since we assumed `\u00ac Q x` at the beginning, it follows that `Q x` and `\u00ac Q x` contradict each other.\n   - Hence, our assumption that `P x` must be false results in `\u00ac P x`.\n\n5. **Formal Strategy**:\n   - Open by applying `intro` for `x` and `not` to `Q x`.\n   - Then `by_contradiction` to assume `P x`.\n   - Substitute into the given `\u2200 a : A, P a \u2192 Q a` to derive `Q x`.\n   - Conclude with `exact` or `contradiction`, finishing the proof.\n\n6. **Using Lean's Tactical Language**:\n   - Use Lean tactics like `intro`, `contradiction`, `apply`, and `exact` to construct the proof step-by-step as we outlined.\n\nIn summary, the proof strategy will rely on the premises given and leverage reduction of the assertion using indirect argumentation derived from basic propositional logic.\n\n",

The initial part of the proof is correctly structured up to the point where we have `hnegQx : \u00ac Q x`. \n2. Instead of using `by_contradiction` here, we can reframe our approach to directly derive `\u00ac P x` from our known information.\n3. We want to prove `\u00ac P x` under the assumption that `\u00ac Q x` is true.\n\nThe correct next step is to use `apply` with the assumption `h` which states that `\u2200 a : A, P a \u2192 Q a`. Given that we have `P x` as our assumption of the negation, we can then call `apply` on `h` for the specific `x` and use `hposPx` to arrive at `Q x`. Then, instead of leading to a contradiction directly with `contradiction`, we will take these derived statements and explicitly use them to finish the proof by stating that these assumptions create a conflict as per the definition of `\u00ac`.\n\nThus, the next operation should be:\n- Instead of going into a contradiction tactic directly, we can lay out the application of the obtained `P x \u2192 Q x` using `apply h` to connect these pieces without raising errors.\n\nSo the operation could be to replace the erroneous use of `by_contradiction` with a correct application leading to a `contradiction` as follows:\n\n1. Use `apply h` to deduce `Q x` from `P x`.\n2. Finally, we can conclude the proof by stating `contradiction` or directly using the successful derivation of `Q x` leading to `\u00ac Q x`.\n\nThis restructuring will not only resolve the current issue but will also keep the logical flow intact while aligning with Lean's expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, the next operation should focus on properly applying `h` to derive `Q x` from the assumption of `P x` and then using that derived contradiction to finalize the proof.\n",

The next step was to assume `P a` to derive a contradiction, which is the correct approach in a proof by contraposition. However, the error arises in the step where the agent attempts to use `h_a` to derive `Q a` from `P a`. This is not necessary for proving `\u00acP a` and leads to the type mismatch error because `nq` is of type `\u00acQ a` and not `False`.\n\nTo correct this, the agent should eliminate the step of deriving `Q a` and instead directly use the `exact nq` tactic to establish the contradiction. The contradiction comes from the fact that we have both `q_a : Q a` (derived from the assumption `P a` and the hypothesis `h`) and `nq : \u00acQ a` (the assumption that `Q a` is not true). By using `exact nq`, we can directly point out this contradiction, as `nq` provides the necessary evidence that `Q a` cannot be true, which contradicts `q_a`.

The first implication to tackle is `P \u2227 P \u2192 P`.

By assuming `P`, the `split` tactic can again be used, which in this context helpfully allows duplication of the assumption `P` to satisfy both components of the conjunction `P \u2227 P`.

                "reasoning": "\nTo address the error encountered in the proof process, we need to ensure that the syntax and usage of the tactics employed are indeed valid in Lean 4. The historical actions indicate that we are correctly using the `iff.intro`, `intro`, `cases`, and `exact` tactics in the proof. However, we should double-check the specific tactics and their corresponding syntax in Lean 4, as some tactics may have slight variations compared to Lean 3.\n\n1. **Focus on the Forward Direction**: We start by re-affirming the forward direction of the proof. We assume `H: P \u2227 P` and correctly apply `cases H` to extract `H1` and `H2`. The line `exact H1` should correctly conclude that `P` holds. We should verify the use of the `exact` tactic to ensure it aligns with Lean 4 standards.\n\n2. **Backward Direction**: In the backward direction, we need to introduce `H: P` correctly and then construct `P \u2227 P` using `and.intro`. This line also appears to be correct, but we should validate that `and.intro H H` is a proper way to construct the conjunction in Lean 4.\n\n3. **Error Handling and Incremental Proving**: Given the error messages, it may be beneficial to test each direction of the proof independently to isolate the source of the error. We can break down the proof into smaller parts, confirming the validity of each before combining them in the full proof.\n\n4. **Comment and Document**: Include inline comments detailing each step in the proof to aid debugging and clarify the logic being applied. This will also make it easier to identify which tactic might be causing issues if further errors arise.\n\nOverall, we need to be cautious and methodical with each proof step, ensuring that we adapt our tactics according to the Lean 4 syntax and semantics. This should lead us to a successful and clean proof of the theorem `andDup`. Let's proceed with a focus on clarity in our tactics and verify each increment as we construct the proof.\n",

We have `h : P \u2194 Q`, which contains both P \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 P.\n2. We need to extract P \u2192 Q from h.\n3. We can do this using `h.mp`, which gives us the P \u2192 Q implication.\n4. We also have `p : P`, which is exactly what we need to apply to this implication.\n5. By applying `h.mp` to `p`, we should obtain Q, which is our goal.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to apply `h.mp p`. This should solve the goal by deriving Q from our given P and the extracted P \u2192 Q implication.\n",

This can be stated as `exists (\u03bb a, P a \u2227 Q a)`.\n\n2. Next, we need to extract the witness `a` from this existential statement. In Lean, you can use the `Exists.elim` tactic to work with this existential hypothesis effectively, allowing us to introduce a variable `a` such that `P a \u2227 Q a` holds.\n\n3. Once we have this witness, we can then apply conjunction elimination. In Lean, we can use the tactic `cases` or the function `and.elim` to obtain both `P a` and `Q a`.\n\n4. With both `P a` and `Q a` available, we can proceed to construct the required existential statements. Specifically, we can utilize `Exists.intro` to show that there exists some `x` such that `P x` holds (specifically, this `a`), and similarly do the same for `Q`.\n\n5. Finally, both existentials can be combined using `and.intro`, thereby achieving our goal of proving `(\u2203 x, P x) \u2227 (\u2203 x, Q x)`.\n\nThus, the next proving operation can include the following steps:\n- Use `Exists.elim` to introduce the witness `a`.\n- Apply the conjunction elimination to derive `P a` and `Q a`.\n- Construct the necessary existential statements using `Exists.intro`.\n- Conclude the proof with `and.intro`.\n\nThis systematic approach will guide the acting agent in executing the next steps effectively. \n",

We will derive two separate claims: one supporting `\u2203 x, P x` and another for `\u2203 x, Q x`.\n\n4. **Construct New Existential Claims**: After extracting `P a` and `Q a`, we'll use `Exists.intro` to construct the goals for `\u2203 x, P x` and `\u2203 x, Q x` separately, ensuring we provide the correct witness for each.\n\n5. **Combine Results**: Finally, we will create the conjunction of the two existential claims using `and.intro` to conclude the proof.\n\nFollowing this structured approach can help mitigate the earlier issues. Let's implement the plan with particularly careful management of our goals after `Exists.elim`.\n\nNext command for the acting agent:\n1. Use `Exists.elim H ` to properly handle the existential quantifier.\n2. Extract `P a` and `Q a` using the conjunction from the hypothesis.\n3. Apply `Exists.intro` correctly to construct the two existential claims, followed by `and.intro` to combine them into our final result.\n\nBy adhering closely to these steps, we should successfully prove the theorem `dist_exists_and`. \n",

The proof did not advance sufficiently, leading to unsolved goals. This indicates a disconnect between introducing the witness and stating the goals.\n\n2. **Evaluate Past Actions and Thoughts**: The process aptly started with `Exists.elim`, but the subsequent steps of extracting `P a` and `Q a` were not integrated correctly into the proof structure. The missed connection in transitioning from hypothesis to conclusions highlights a potential oversight in articulating the proof flow properly.\n\n3. **Propose Improvements**: Next time, it would be beneficial to ensure each new existential claim is distinctly stated post-extraction. We might also introduce checkpoints after major steps\u2014like after `Exists.elim`\u2014to confirm that all goals are appropriately addressed and visible in the proof state.\n\n4. **Align with the Overall Goal**: Each action taken should contribute clearly towards proving the entire theorem as a coherent whole. By carefully branching goals and ensuring clarity when constructing existential statements, we can align closely with the objective of establishing the theorem fully and rigorously.\n\n5. **Use of 'sorry'**: In Lean proofs, especially with the goal of rigorous proof without reliance on placeholders or apologies, it is essential to avoid substituting incomplete steps with 'sorry'. Each step should confirm valid transitions leading to the conclusion.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n- Use `Exists.elim H` followed by clear management of goals, verifying that the transition from the existential elimination is well-defined.\n- Introduce the claims for `\u2203 x, P x` and `\u2203 x, Q x` individually with care, using `Exists.intro` for clarity.\n- Regularly check the proof state to ensure all goals are adequately addressed after each significant operation to avoid leaving unsolved goals.\n\nBy following this enhanced strategy and focusing on clarity in managing existential claims, we aim for a successful path in proving the theorem `dist_exists_and`.",

The goal is to prove that if for all elements x in type X, if both P(x) and Q(x) together imply R(x), then it is also true that for each element x in type X, P(x) alone and Q(x) alone (separately provided) also imply R(x).\n\nStep 2: Setup the Proof Environment\n- This theorem involves universal quantification over some type `X` and properties `P`, `Q`, `R` which are predicates involving elements of type `X`.\n- Import any standard lean libraries such as `logic.basic` if not available.\n\nStep 3: Start the Proof\n- We need to show that if `\u2200 x : X, P x \u2227 Q x \u2192 R x` holds, then `\u2200 x : X, P x \u2192 Q x \u2192 R x` must also hold.\n- Translate the first hypothesis into Lean: Assume an `h : \u2200 x : X, P x \u2227 Q x \u2192 R x` is given.\n\nStep 4: Proof Construction\n- Use the universal property tactic, possibly `intro x`, to fix an arbitrary element `x` in `X`.\n- Next, make further assumptions for `P x` and `Q x` separately, perhaps using `intros hp hq`.\n- The crucial step is to show `R x` using already assumed `h`, `hp`, and `hq`.\n- Use previous understanding that `P x \u2227 Q x` is necessary for `R x`. Formulate this as `have hPQ : P x \u2227 Q x := \u27e8hp, hq\u27e9`, using assumptions `hp : P x` and `hq : Q x`.\n- Apply `h` to `hPQ` to obtain `R x`. Specifically, `apply h x hPQ` should give `R x`.\n\nStep 5: Completing Proof\n- With `R x` established from `hp` and `hq`, you can use `exact` or `assumption` tactic to conclude that `\u2200 x : X, P x \u2192 Q x \u2192 R x`.\n- Close the proof environment with necessary ending keywords, depending on the syntax used in your Lean environment.\n\nStep 6: Simplify and Reiterate\n- Check for any possible simplifications. For example, can a direct application or integration of tactics reduce steps?\n- Review the assumed statements and proved steps for any logical loopholes.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion\n- With the proof steps properly aligned and all cases considered, the theorem `forallEx2` gets validated. You've shown logically that separate implications of `P x` to `Q x` also ensures `R x` under given initial conditions.\n",

Assume \u00ac (\u2203 x : X, P x) as our hypothesis.\n   b. To prove \u2200 x : X, \u00ac P x, we take an arbitrary element x and attempt to show \u00ac P x.\n   c.

This can be done using the `take` or `let` keyword, which allows us to work with this arbitrary element.\n\n3. **Assumption for Contradiction**: The agent should then assume P x holds, using the `assume` keyword again. This is crucial as it sets up a framework for deriving a contradiction. Writing something like `assume h : P x` will help structure this.\n\n4. **Deriving the Contradiction**: The agent will need to show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. The key here is to use the existing assumption \u00ac (\u2203 x : X, P x) to show that since P x holds, there exists an `x` such that P x is true, contradicting the original hypothesis. This would typically be done by stating that this contradicts our assumption using some form of `have` or `apply` syntax.\n\n5. **State the Conclusion**: Finally, once the contradiction is established, we should use `exact` or derive the necessary conclusion \u00ac P x and demonstrate that this holds for the arbitrary `x`, allowing us to conclude \u2200 x : X, \u00ac P x.\n\nIn summary, the steps should look something like this: \n\n- Introduce the hypothesis \u00ac (\u2203 x : X, P x).\n- Take an arbitrary element x from X.\n- Assume P x holds.\n- Show that this creates a contradiction with \u00ac (\u2203 x : X, P x).\n- Conclude that \u00ac P x must be true for that arbitrary x and hence for all x.\n\nThis structured approach will help the acting agent to clearly establish the proof in Lean 4 syntax. \n\nTo encapsulate, the lean code should encapsulate this reasoning and follow the established structure. \n\nNow, the acting agent can proceed to implement the above steps in the Lean 4 environment. \n",

We need to show `\u2200 x : X, P x`.\n   - Similar to the forward direction, use the assumption `\u2200 x : X, P x \u2194 Q x` to rewrite `Q x` as `P x` for any `x`.\n   - Since `\u2200 x : X, Q x` holds, it follows that `P x` must also hold for all `x`.\n\nIn Lean 4, we can structure the proof using the `intro` tactic to introduce assumptions and the `exact` tactic to conclude the proof based on the introduced assumptions and logical equivalences.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n- Introduce the hypothesis `h1 : \u2200 x : X, P x \u2194 Q x`.\n- Introduce the hypothesis `h2 : (\u2200 x : X, P x) \u2194 (\u2200 x : X, Q x)`.\n- Split the proof into two parts using `split`.\n  - For the forward direction, assume `h3 : \u2200 x : X, P x` and show `\u2200 x : X, Q x`.\n    - Use `intro x` to introduce a variable `x : X`.\n    - Use `have h4 : P x \u2194 Q x := h1 x` to get the equivalence for `x`.\n    - Use `have h5 : P x := h3 x` to get `P x`.\n    - Use `exact h4.mp h5` to conclude `Q x`.\n  - For the backward direction, assume `h6 : \u2200 x : X, Q x` and show `\u2200 x : X, P x`.\n    - Use `intro x` to introduce a variable `x : X`.\n    - Use `have h7 : P x \u2194 Q x := h1 x` to get the equivalence for `x`.\n    - Use `have h8 : Q x := h6 x` to get `Q x`.\n    - Use `exact h7.mpr h8` to conclude `P x`.\n",

To address this, we should use the `iff.intro` tactic, which is specifically designed to handle such cases by allowing us to separately prove the forward and backward directions of the implication.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Introduce the hypothesis** `h1 : \u2200 x : X, P x \u2194 Q x`.\n2. **Use `iff.intro`** to set up the proof for both directions of the implication.\n   - For the forward direction, assume `h2 : \u2200 x : X, P x` and show `\u2200 x : X, Q x`.\n     - Introduce a variable `x : X`.\n     - Use the equivalence `h1 x` to rewrite `P x` as `Q x`.\n     - Conclude `Q x` from `P x` using the equivalence.\n   - For the backward direction, assume `h3 : \u2200 x : X, Q x` and show `\u2200 x : X, P x`.\n     - Introduce a variable `x : X`.\n     - Use the equivalence `h1 x` to rewrite `Q x` as `P x`.\n     - Conclude `P x` from `Q x` using the equivalence.\n\nBy using `iff.intro`, we ensure that each direction of the implication is handled correctly, avoiding the issues encountered with `split`.\n",

The theorem `logicEx5` takes four arguments: a type `A` and three propositional functions `P`, `Q`, and `R` on `A`. The goal is to prove that if for all `a` of type `A`, `P a` implies `Q a`, and if for all `a` of type `A`, `P a` holds, then for all `a` of type `A`, `Q a` holds.\n\n2. Before diving into the proof, it would be beneficial to establish some basic definitions and lemmas related to the problem domain. We can use the `sorry` keyword to skip the proofs of these lemmas for now, and come back to them later.\n\n3. To prove the main theorem, we can follow a top-down approach. We can start by assuming the antecedent conditions, i.e., for all `a` of type `A`, `P a` implies `Q a` and for all `a` of type `A`, `P a` holds.\n\n4. Using these assumptions, we can then try to prove the consequent condition, i.e., for all `a` of type `A`, `Q a` holds. To do this, we can use the `intro` tactic to introduce a generic `a` of type `A`, and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the first antecedent condition to `a`.\n\n5. This will give us `P a` as a hypothesis, which we can then use to apply the second antecedent condition to get `Q a` as a conclusion. We can then use the `exact` tactic to close the subgoal with `Q a`.\n\n6. Once we have proved the main theorem, we can then go back to the lemmas we skipped earlier and fill in the missing proofs. This will help us to better understand the problem and its underlying structure, and will also ensure that our proof is complete and correct.\n\n7. Finally, we can reflect on the proof and consider whether there are any simplifications or optimizations that can be made. We can also think about how the proof might be extended or generalized to other similar problems.\n",

Thus, we shall focus on developing each logical step tightly and explicitly derive the proposition from our assumptions without shortcuts.\n\nFollowing this reflection, the next steps should involve carefully rewriting the proof with an emphasis on correct implications and generating contradictions directly from the premises set by the assumptions.

By the definition of conjunction, `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)` is true if and only if both `P` and `P \u2228 Q` are true. Since `P` is part of the conjunction, it must be true, and thus the implication holds.\n\nFor the second implication `P \u2192 P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)`, we need to construct the conjunction `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)` from `P`. We can do this by using the introduction rule for conjunction, which requires us to prove both `P` and `P \u2228 Q`. Since we already have `P`, we need to prove `P \u2228 Q`. This is straightforward since `P \u2228 Q` is true if either `P` or `Q` is true, and since `P` is true, `P \u2228 Q` must also be true.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Prove `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q) \u2192 P`:\n   - Assume `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)` is true.\n   - By the definition of conjunction, deduce that `P` is true.\n   - Conclude the implication.\n\n2. Prove `P \u2192 P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)`:\n   - Assume `P` is true.\n   - Prove `P \u2228 Q` by using the fact that `P` is true.\n   - Use the introduction rule for conjunction to deduce `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)` from `P` and `P \u2228 Q`.\n   - Conclude the implication.\n\n3. Use the biconditional introduction rule to combine the two implications into the theorem `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q) \u2194 P`.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to prove the theorem efficiently.\n",

Instead of introducing a new hypothesis, the agent should directly apply the conjunction elimination rule to `h`. This rule allows us to infer `P` from `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)` by accessing the first element of the conjunction, which can be done using `h.left`. Here is the corrected reasoning for the acting agent's next operation:\n\nTo properly prove the first implication `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q) \u2192 P`, you should start by applying the conjunction elimination rule to the assumption `h`. This will allow you to directly derive `P` without the need for an additional `have` statement. You can do this by using `h.left` to access the `P` part of the conjunction `P \u2227 (P \u2228 Q)`. Once you have derived `P` using `h.left`, you can then complete the proof of the implication.\n",

This helps us translate the conjunction from one form to the other.\n\n3. **Using Logical Equivalences**:\n   - Recall that:\n     - (A \u2194 B) can be rewritten as (A \u2192 B) \u2227 (B \u2192 A).\n   - We will use this equivalence to break down both of the biconditional statements provided.\n\n4. **Proof Strategy**:\n   - Prove the equivalence of the conjunctions by demonstrating that each side implies the other:\n     1.

Start the proof by using the assumption `P1 \u2228 Q1`. In Lean, this can be initiated with the `have` tactic or simply through starting your proof script with assuming `P1 \u2228 Q1`.\n\n2. After the assumption is made, the next part would be to distinguish between the two cases of the disjunction:\n   - **Case 1**: If `P1` is true, then by `P1 \u2194 P2`, it follows that `P2` is also true, thus `P2 \u2228 Q2` will be true regardless of `Q2`. Use the `left` tactic to communicate that `P2` holds.\n   - **Case 2**: If `Q1` is true, then by `Q1 \u2194 Q2`, you can conclude that `Q2` is true, thus also ensuring `P2 \u2228 Q2` is true. Use the `right` tactic here.\n\n3. After establishing both cases lead to `P2 \u2228 Q2`, complete this step by concluding that `(P1 \u2228 Q1) \u2192 (P2 \u2228 Q2)` is established.\n\n4.

Using `H1`, we need to derive `P1` from this. The correct application here is to use `H1.mp hP2` to derive `hP1`. After obtaining `hP1`, we subsequently need to apply `hP1Q1`, which is supposed to yield `hQ1 : Q1`. Finally, we use `H2.mpr hQ1` to get `Q2`. \n\n   It\u2019s important to check that both `hP1` and `hQ1` are being used in their respective contexts: `hP1` should be a valid proposition leading to `hQ1` and then to `hQ2` correctly. So line it up in the following steps:\n   \n   - Use `H1.mp hP2` to derive `hP1` correctly.\n   - Call `hP1Q1 hP1` to yield `hQ1`.\n   - Finally, apply `H2.mpr hQ1` to derive `Q2`.\n\n2. **Second Implication**: For the second implication, where we aim to show `(P2 \u2192 Q2)` implies `(P1 \u2192 Q1)`, the structure is analogous. We assume `hP1 : P1` then use `H1.mpr hP1` to obtain `hP2`. Using `hP2`, we proceed by the `hP2Q2` implication to derive `hQ2`. Finally, we conclude `Q1` using `H2.mp hQ2`.\n\nIn summary, for each step in the proof, make sure to ensure that the types align properly before applications. It's about careful tracking of the variables and their mappings from `P1` to `P2` and `Q1` to `Q2` using the assumptions.\n\nFollowing these corrections and structuring clearly at each juncture will resolve the type mismatch errors and facilitate a smooth completion of the proof for `implyCongr`.\n",

Here\u2019s how the reasoning should proceed:\n\n1. **Use `split` to handle the equivalence**:\n   - This will generate two subgoals: one for proving `(P \u2227 Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2192 Q \u2192 R)` and another for proving `(P \u2192 Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2227 Q \u2192 R)`.\n\n2. **For the first subgoal `(P \u2227 Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2192 Q \u2192 R)`**:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis `h1: P \u2227 Q \u2192 R`.\n   - Then introduce `h2: P` and `h3: Q` to work towards deriving `R`.\n   - Form `P \u2227 Q` using `And.intro h2 h3`.\n   - Apply `h1` to `P \u2227 Q` to derive `R`.\n\n3. **For the second subgoal `(P \u2192 Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2227 Q \u2192 R)`**:\n   - Introduce the hypothesis `h4: P \u2192 Q \u2192 R`.\n   - Then introduce `h5: P \u2227 Q` to work towards deriving `R`.\n   - Extract `P` and `Q` from `h5`.\n   - Use `h4` and `P` to get `Q \u2192 R`.\n   - Finally, apply `Q` to `Q \u2192 R` to derive `R`.\n\nBy following this structured approach, we ensure that each part of the equivalence is proven correctly within Lean's framework.\n",
                "reflection": "```\nFlaw: The use of the `split` tactic was unsuccessful due to an unrecognized failure, possibly related to the context or setup in which it was applied, leading to an inability to proceed with the proof as intended.\nImprovement: Before applying the `split` tactic, verify the environment and context to ensure compatibility, and if necessary, explore alternative tactics or configurations that can effectively decompose the equivalence into its constituent implications.\n```",

We need to show that if `(P \u2228 Q \u2192 R)` is true, then both `(P \u2192 R)` and `(Q \u2192 R)` are true.\n2. Begin by stating the assumption: `assume h : P \u2228 Q \u2192 R`.\n3. Now, we need to show `(P \u2192 R)`. Assume `P` is true. From `P`, we can infer `P \u2228 Q` is true. \n4. Applying our assumption `h`, we derive `R`. Thus we have established `P \u2192 R`.\n5. Next, we need to show `(Q \u2192 R)`. Assume `Q` is true. Similarly, `P \u2228 Q` is true. \n6. Again, using `h`, we derive `R`. This establishes `Q \u2192 R`.\n7. Consequently, we conclude that `(P \u2192 R) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R)` is true.\n\nWe can now write this out in Lean using the following structure:\n",

The implicit argument wasn\u2019t correctly inferred due to missing constraints on the types when using `Or.inl` and `Or.inr`.\n\n2. **Evaluating Past Actions**:\n   In the past actions taken, the approach to proving both directions of the equivalence was fundamentally correct. However, when introducing `R` from the implications, we must ensure that the proper context and types are fully declared to enable Lean to reason about them without compilation errors. There was also a missed opportunity to define types unambiguously during the proof steps.\n\n3. **Proposing Improvements**:\n   For the next steps, we should provide explicit type annotations where needed in the proof of `P \u2192 R` and `Q \u2192 R`. Instead of relying solely on Lean's type inference for cases, we could provide clearer directives about the types being used. This could involve changing the way we construct our assumptions or outputs, such as explicitly stating that we're applying the implication `h` correctly after confirming the type derived from `Or.inl` or `Or.inr` aligns with what `h` expects.\n\n4. **Aligning with Overall Goal**:\n   The overall goal is to prove the theorem successfully with rigorous adherence to Lean's syntax and type requirements. Ensuring clear and explicit directions for each step of the proof will align future actions more closely with this goal, thus avoiding undefined conditions or misunderstandings in types.\n\n5. **Certification Process Note**:\n   We confirm that the term \"sorry\" is not to be used in the proving process, so we must ensure every step is covered adequately. The proof must be streamlined to avoid any placeholder statements.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Revise the proof structure for the forward direction to integrate explicit typing and possibly utilize Lean's `exact` or `apply` tactics appropriately, ensuring the conditions in `assume h : P \u2228 Q \u2192 R` and the resulting applications are robust and clear.\n- Continue to maintain this clarity for the backward direction as well when proving that `(P \u2192 R) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2228 Q \u2192 R)`. \n\nBy focusing on these actionable insights, we will be better positioned to improve our outcomes in subsequent interactions and achieve a successful proof with no errors or confusion in the underlying logic.",

Here's how we can fix this:\n\n1. **Introduce `pq` in a Separate Scope**: Instead of defining `pq` within the assumptions `p` and `q`, we can define it directly based on the case from the `intro pq` step.\n\n2. **Using the Cases Properly**: When we call `cases pq`, we can directly refer to `h1.1` and `h1.2` without separately needing to keep `pq` around if we manage the implications correctly.\n\n3. **Refactor the Case Analysis**: We should follow through the proof and ensure that when we analyze the `P \u2228 Q` case, we derive `R` using the predicates directly referenced from the assumption `h1`. \n\nHere's how to adjust the proof structure:\n\n- After introducing the variable `pq`, perform the case analysis immediately, ensuring in each case (`P` or `Q`), we properly reference `h1.1` or `h1.2`.\n\nThis restructuring should eliminate the scope issue and allow for smooth flow in the proof.

This led to an \"unknown identifier\" error, halting the progress of the proof.\n\n2. **Evaluate Past Actions and Thoughts**: In the earlier reasoning, there was a missed understanding of how identifiers work in nested scopes in Lean 4. The assumption was that `pq` would remain accessible after entering a new context, which it did not.\n\n3. **Propose Improvements**: Going forward, we need to rethink how we pull and use identifiers when handling implications and case analyses. Specifically, we can:\n   - Define `pq` earlier or at a higher scope to maintain accessibility.\n   - Employ case analysis right after introducing `pq`, ensuring to handle both possibilities (`P` or `Q`) using their respective hypotheses without losing access to `pq`.\n\n4. **Consider Overall Goal**: The ultimate aim is to successfully prove the equivalence stated in the target theorem. Future actions should focus on maintaining clarity in variable usage and ensuring smooth transitions between assumptions and cases.\n\n5. **Use of 'Sorry' in Certification**: While we aim for correctness and rigor in proofs, we must ensure that no informal expressions or shortcuts (like 'sorry') are included in the Lean proofs.

From the planning strategy and reflection notes, it is clear that the provided proof makes an attempt to use the Lean tactic `rw hnm` to rewrite `p + n` as `p + m` under the assumption `hnm : n = m`. This is a reasonable approach, but it seems that the problem lies in either an incorrect syntax or placement of this rewriting step.\n\nGiven that the `intro hnm` step successfully introduces the assumption `hnm : n = m`, the next logical step is indeed to invoke rewriting to substitute `m` for `n` in `p + n`. However, the issue may be with how `rw` is being applied or it could be a problem with other surrounding syntax or tactic usages. The error `unexpected identifier` suggests there might be an incorrect syntax or misplaced tactic.\n\nTo correct this, ensure that the syntax is correct and all necessary tactics for executing the rewriting are correctly employed. Confirm that `rw` is placed correctly after an assumption or conditional that provides the necessary substitution avenue and ensure no extraneous or misplaced identifiers or brackets are causing syntactical errors. Also, ensure that the goal and the assumptions at that point are consistent with the use of the tactics. If there are syntax errors, checking the actual placement and syntax usage in the Lean environment would be needed. Sometimes errors might be due to missing tactics or libraries as well, so make sure all needed components are included.\n\nIn conclusion, rectify the syntax issue first and reattempt the proof ensuring the assumption `(n = m) -> (p + n = p + m)` is valid at the point where `rw hnm` is used, thereby simplifying `p + n` to `p + m` under the assumption `n = m`. Here, using direct equality properties through substitution or other Lean-native equality tactics after `intro hnm` would be advisable to resolve any lingering issues in this step of the proof.\n",

This theorem can be directly applied here with `a = p`, `b = n`, and `c = m`.\n\n2. **Backward Direction**: Prove that if `n = m`, then `p + n = p + m`.\n   - This part is straightforward as it involves substituting `n` with `m` in the expression `p + n` due to the equality `n = m`.\n   - Use the `congr_arg` tactic to apply the substitution.\n\nThe overall strategy involves leveraging the built-in properties of natural numbers and their operations in Lean, particularly focusing on the cancellation property of addition.\n\n**Plan Summary**:\n- For the forward direction, apply `Nat.add_left_cancel` to show that `p + n = p + m` implies `n = m`.\n- For the backward direction, use `congr_arg` to substitute `n` with `m` in `p + n` to get `p + m`.\n",

We can directly apply the `Nat.add_left_cancel` theorem, which is designed for this exact scenario. This theorem asserts that if the sum of a number `p` with another number `n` equals the sum of `p` with a third number `m`, then `n` must equal `m`. This aligns perfectly with our goal for the forward direction.\n\nFor the backward direction, we need to show that if `n = m`, then `p + n = p + m`. This is a simpler task because it involves substituting `n` with `m` in the expression `p + n`. The `congr_arg` tactic is suitable for this purpose as it allows us to apply a function (in this case, adding `p`) to both sides of an equality.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to start with the forward direction and apply the `Nat.add_left_cancel` theorem.\n",

Therefore, `mul zero 0` should be `zero`.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume `mul k 0 = 0` for some arbitrary `k` (inductive hypothesis), and then prove that `mul (succ k) 0 = 0`.\n   - By the definition of `mul`, `mul (succ k) 0` is `add 0 (mul k 0)`.\n   - Use the inductive hypothesis to replace `mul k 0` with `0`.\n   - Simplify the expression using the definition of `add` to show that `add 0 0` equals `0`.\n\nBy completing these steps, we will have proven the theorem `mulZeroR` for all natural numbers `n`.\n",

Finally, we can use the commutativity of addition (`addComm`) to rearrange terms and show that `mul (succ k) m = mul m (succ k)`.\n\nGiven the current state, the next step should be to complete the base case by explicitly showing `mul 0 m = 0` and `mul m 0 = 0` using `mulZeroR`. After that, we should move on to the inductive step and start by applying the inductive hypothesis and the definition of `mul` to progress towards proving `mul (succ k) m = mul m (succ k)`.\n",

Multiplication is defined recursively, with the base case being `mul zero _ = zero` and the inductive step `mul (succ n') m = add m (mul n' m)`.\n\n2. **Apply the Definition to the Theorem**: Start the proof by applying the definition of `mul` to the left-hand side of the equation `mul n (succ zero)`. Since `succ zero` is the Lean 4 representation of `1`, this will simplify our term to `add (mul n zero) (mul n (succ zero))`.\n\n3. **Use Known Theorems**: We can use the theorem `mul_zero_right` (which should be defined in the Lean 4 library, or can be proved similarly to `mul_one_right`) to simplify `mul n zero` to `zero`. This will reduce our term to `add zero (mul n (succ zero))`.\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression**: By the definition of addition, `add zero _ = _`, so our term simplifies to `mul n (succ zero)`.\n\n5. **Show Equality by Induction**: Now, we need to show that `mul n (succ zero)` simplifies to `n`. We can do this by structural induction on `n`. The base case is when `n` is `zero`, where `mul zero (succ zero) = zero` by definition, which equals `zero`. For the inductive step, assume `mul k (succ zero) = k` holds for some `k : Nat`, and show that `mul (succ k) (succ zero) = succ k`. Using the definition of `mul`, this expands to `add (succ zero) (mul k (succ zero))`. By our inductive hypothesis, `mul k (succ zero) = k`, so we have `add (succ zero) k`. Since `add (succ zero) k` simplifies to `succ k` by the definition of addition, the inductive step holds.\n\n6. **Conclude the Proof**: After showing the base case and the inductive step, we can conclude that `mul n (succ zero) = n` for all `n : Nat`, thus proving the theorem.\n\n7. **Check for Any Special Cases**: Ensure that the proof holds for the edge cases, such as when `n` is `zero`.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to construct a complete and accurate proof for the theorem `mul_one_right`.\n",
                "reasoning": "\nThe current observation indicates that the acting agent has started the proof by induction on `n` and has correctly handled the base case. However, there is an issue in the inductive step. After applying the definition of `mul` and using the inductive hypothesis `ih`, the agent is trying to simplify the expression `add Nat.zero.succ (mul n' Nat.zero.succ) = n' + 1`. The agent has used `rw [ih]` to substitute `mul n' Nat.zero.succ` with `n'`, but the next step is incorrect because they are trying to apply the `add` theorem directly without properly simplifying the expression.\n\nThe agent should first simplify `Nat.zero.succ` to `succ zero` since `Nat.zero.succ` is the Lean 4 representation of `1`. Then, they should use the `add` theorem to simplify `add (succ zero) n'` to `succ n'`. The error message suggests that the Lean 4 system is not able to resolve the goal `(add zero n').succ = n' + 1` because the agent did not correctly apply the definition of addition.\n\nTo guide the acting agent, the next step should be to correctly apply the definition of addition and simplify the expression as follows:\n\n1. Recognize that `Nat.zero.succ` is equivalent to `succ zero`.\n2. Replace `Nat.zero.succ` with `succ zero` in the expression.\n3. Apply the `add` theorem to simplify `add (succ zero) n'` to `succ n'`.\n4. Use the fact that `succ n'` is equivalent to `n' + 1` in Lean 4 to complete the inductive step.\n\nThe agent should update the proof script as follows:\n\n",
